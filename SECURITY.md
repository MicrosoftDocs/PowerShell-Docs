## Security

Microsoft takes the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all
source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, which include [Microsoft][10],
[Azure][08], [DotNet][09], [AspNet][07], [Xamarin][11], and [our GitHub organizations][12].

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Microsoft-owned repository that meets
[Microsoft's definition of a security vulnerability][04], please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at
[https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report][02].

If you prefer to submit without logging in, send email to [secure@microsoft.com][13]. If possible,
encrypt your message with our PGP key; please download it from the
[Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page][06].

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via
email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at
[microsoft.com/msrc][05].

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better
understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

If you are reporting for a bug bounty, more complete reports can contribute to a higher bounty
award. Please visit our [Microsoft Bug Bounty Program][01] page for more details about our active
programs.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

Microsoft follows the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure][03].
