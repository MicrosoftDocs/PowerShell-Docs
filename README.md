> **Note**: Currently, this repository is intended only for PowerShell [Desired State Configuration (DSC)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/overview) content and [Windows Management Framework (WMF) release notes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/wmf/releasenotes). In the future, the repo will be expanded to include a wider range of PowerShell documentation.
