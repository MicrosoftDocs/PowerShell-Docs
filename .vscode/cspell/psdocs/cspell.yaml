# Any patterns listed here are ignored for spellcheck.
#
# We ignore the URLs for inline markdown links, Markdown link references, and Markdown link
# reference definitions because these will otherwise be very noisy and they're not displayed to
# readers anyway.
#
# We ignore the spelling for all text in output code blocks for Markdown files because that text
# represents output from real commands and any spelling errors are not a fault in the documentation.
#
# We ignore registry paths, wildcard fragments, and components of well-known domains because those
# are intentionally or uncontrollably downcased or "incorrect" spellings.
