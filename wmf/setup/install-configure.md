- WMF 5.1 Preview must be uninstalled before installing WMF 5.1 RTM.
- WMF 5.1 may be installed directly over WMF 5.0 or WMF 4.0.
- It is **not required** to install WMF 4.0 prior to installing WMF 5.1 on Windows 7 and Windows
  Server 2008 R2.

## Install WMF 5.1 for Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7

> [!NOTE]
> Installation instructions for Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 have changed, and differ from
> the instructions for the other packages. Installation instructions for Windows Server 2012 R2,
> Windows Server 2012, and Windows 8.1 are below.

### WMF 5.1 Prerequisites for Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and Windows 7 SP1

Installation of WMF 5.1 on either Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 or Windows 7 SP1, requires the
following:

- Latest service pack must be installed.
- WMF 3.0 **must not** be installed. Installing WMF 5.1 over WMF 3.0 will result in the loss of the
  **PSModulePath** (`$env:PSModulePath`), which can cause other applications to fail. Before
  installing WMF 5.1, you must either un-install WMF 3.0, or save the **PSModulePath** and then
  restore it manually after WMF 5.1 installation is complete.
- WMF 5.1 requires at least [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42642).
  You can install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 by following the instructions at the download
  location.

### Installing WMF 5.1 on Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7

1. Navigate to the folder into which you downloaded the ZIP file.

2. Right-click on the ZIP file, and select **Extract All...**. The ZIP file contains two files: an
   MSU and the `Install-WMF5.1.ps1` script file. Once you have unpacked the ZIP file, you can copy
   the contents to any machine running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.

3. After extracting the ZIP file contents, open PowerShell as administrator, then navigate to the
   folder containing the contents of the ZIP file.

4. Run the `Install-WMF5.1.ps1` script in that folder, and follow the instructions. This script will
   check the prerequisites on the local machine, and install WMF 5.1 if the prerequisites have been
   met. The prerequisites are listed below.

   `Install-WMF5.1.ps1` takes the following parameters to ease automating the installation on Windows
   Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7:

   - **AcceptEula**: When this parameter is included, the EULA is automatically accepted and will not be
     displayed.
   - **AllowRestart**: This parameter can only be used if AcceptEula is specified. If this parameter is
     included, and a restart is required after installing WMF 5.1, the restart will happen without
     prompting immediately after the installation is completed.

## WinRM Dependency

Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) depends on WinRM. WinRM is not enabled by
default on Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7. Run `Set-WSManQuickConfig`, in a Windows PowerShell
elevated session, to enable WinRM.

## Install WMF 5.1 for Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows 8.1

### Install from Windows File Explorer

1. Navigate to the folder into which you downloaded the MSU file.
2. Double-click the MSU to run it.

### Installing from the Command Prompt

1. After downloading the correct package for your computer's architecture, open a Command Prompt
   window with elevated user rights (Run as Administrator). On the Server Core installation options
   of Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, Command Prompt
   opens with elevated user rights by default.
2. Change directories to the folder into which you have downloaded or copied the WMF 5.1
   installation package.
3. Run one of the following commands:
   - On computers that are running Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows 8.1 x64, run
     `Win8.1AndW2K12R2-KB3191564-x64.msu /quiet`.
   - On computers that are running Windows Server 2012, run `W2K12-KB3191565-x64.msu /quiet`.
   - On computers that are running Windows 8.1 x86, run `Win8.1-KB3191564-x86.msu /quiet`.

> [!NOTE]
> Installing WMF 5.1 requires a reboot. Using the `/quiet` option will reboot the system without
> warning. Use the `/norestart` option to avoid rebooting. However, WMF 5.1 will not be installed
> until you have rebooted.
