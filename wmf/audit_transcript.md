### Enhanced Transcription Options

Windows PowerShell transcription has been improved to apply to all hosting applications (such as Windows PowerShell ISE) rather than just the console host (powershell.exe).

In addition to extending for transcripting, the transcripting functionality itself has been updated to support arbitrary nesting of transcripts, additional metadata in the resulting transcript header, aset a transcription output directory (to support centralized log collection).

Transcription options (including enabling a system-wide transcript) can be configured by configuring the **Turn on PowerShell Transcription** Group Policy setting (in Administrative Templates -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Windows PowerShell).
