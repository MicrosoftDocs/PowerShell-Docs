#### Attach to Process hosting PowerShell

You can now attach to any computer process that has Windows PowerShell loaded. You do this by entering into an interactive session with the process, similarly to how you enter into an interactive remote session by running the Enter-PSSession cmdlet.

-   Enter-PSHostProcess

-   Exit-PSHostProcess
