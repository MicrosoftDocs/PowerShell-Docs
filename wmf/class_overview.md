# Creating Custom Types using PowerShell Classes

Weâ€™ve improved the PowerShell language for defining classes and other user-defined types by using formal syntax and semantics that are similar to other object-oriented programming languages. The goal is to enable developers and IT professionals to embrace PowerShell for a wider range of use cases, simplify development of PowerShell artifacts (such as DSC resources), and accelerate coverage of management surfaces.

## Supported scenarios in this release

-   Define DSC resources and their associated types by using the PowerShell language
-   Define custom types in PowerShell by using familiar object-oriented programming constructs, such as classes, properties, methods, etc.
-   Inheritance support with class in PowerShell and class base DSC resource
-   Debug types by using the PowerShell language
-   Generate and handle exceptions by using formal mechanisms, and at the right level
