# Creating Custom Types using PowerShell Classes

We’ve improved the Windows PowerShell language for defining classes and other user-defined types, by using formal syntax and semantics that are similar to other object-oriented programming languages. The goal is to enable developers and IT professionals to embrace Windows PowerShell for a wider range of use cases, simplify development of Windows PowerShell artifacts (such as DSC resources), and accelerate coverage of management surfaces.

## Supported scenarios in this release

-   Define DSC resources and their associated types by using the Windows PowerShell language.
-   Define custom types in Windows PowerShell by using familiar object-oriented programming constructs, such as classes, properties, methods, etc.
-   Inheritance support with class in Windows PowerShell and class base DSC resource.
-   Debug types by using the Windows PowerShell language.
-   Generate and handle exceptions by using formal mechanisms, and at the right level.
