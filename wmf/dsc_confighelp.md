# Help support for DSC configurations

You can now use comment-based help inside of DSC configurations and get help on usage of that configuration when calling the configuration function with `-?`:  

First, we define two configuration functions called HelpSample1 and HelpSample2, including comment-based help with each of them:

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
The synopsis for the configuration goes here. This can be one line, or many.

.DESCRIPTION
The description for the configuration is usually a longer, more detailed explanation of what the script or function does. Use as many lines as you need.

.PARAMETER computername
Here, the dotted keyword is followed by a single parameter name. Don't precede that with a hyphen. The following lines describe the purpose of the parameter:

.PARAMETER filePath
Provide a PARAMETER section for each parameter that your script or function accepts.

.EXAMPLE
There's no need to number your examples.

.EXAMPLE
Windows PowerShell will number them for you when it displays your help text to a user.

    param([string]$computername,[string]$filePath)
