# Clipboard cmdlets
**Get-Clipboard** and **Set-Clipboard** make it easier for you to transfer content to and from a Windows PowerShell session. For example, if you use Windows Explorer to copy three files
to the clipboard (by selecting them and pressing `ctrl-c`, for example), you can then easily access the contents of the clipboard as a list of files:

```powershell
PS C:\\&gt; Get-Clipboard -Format FileDropList

Directory: C:\\Users\\slee\\Downloads\\Example

Mode LastWriteTime Length Name

---- ------------- ------ ----

-a---- 4/14/2015 1:19 PM 0 File2.txt

-a---- 4/14/2015 1:19 PM 0 File3.txt

-a---- 4/14/2015 1:19 PM 0 File1.txt
```


The Clipboard cmdlets support images, audio files, file lists, and text.
