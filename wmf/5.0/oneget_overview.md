# Software Discovery, Install and Inventory with PackageManagement

PackageManagement (aka OneGet) is a new way to discover and install software packages from around the web. It is a manager or multiplexor of existing package managers (also called package providers) that unifies Windows package management with a single Windows PowerShell interface. With PackageManagement, you can do the following.

-   Manage a list of software repositories in which packages can be searched, acquired, and installed
-   Discover and install different package managers
-   Discover software packages you need
-   Seamlessly install, uninstall, and inventory packages from one or more software repositories

For more details, see http://oneget.org/.
