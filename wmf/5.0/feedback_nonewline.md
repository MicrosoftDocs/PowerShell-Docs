# NoNewLine parameter
**Out-File**, **Add-Content**, and **Set-Content** now have a new **–NoNewline** switch which simply omits a new line after the output.
```powershell
PS C:\> "This is " | Out-File -FilePath Example.txt -NoNewline

PS C:\>; "a single " | Add-Content -Path Example.txt -NoNewline

PS C:\> "sentence." | Add-Content -Path Example.txt -NoNewline

PS C:\> Get-Content .\Example.txt

This is a single sentence.
```
Without **–NoNewline** specified, each fragment would be on a separate line:
```powershell
PS C:\> "This is " | Out-File -FilePath Example.txt

PS C:\> "a single " | Add-Content -Path Example.txt

PS C:\> "sentence." | Add-Content -Path Example.txt

PS C:\> Get-Content .\Example.txt

This is

a single

sentence.
```
