# Unified and Consistent State and Status Representation

A series of enhancements have been made in this release for automations built LCM state and DSC
status. These include unified and consistent state and status representations, manageable datetime
property of status objects returned by `Get-DscConfigurationStatus` cmdlet and enhanced LCM state
details property returned by `Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager` cmdlet.

The representation of LCM state and DSC operation status are revisited and unified according to
following rules:

1. Notprocessed resource does not impact LCM state and DSC status.
2. LCM stop processing further resources once it encounters a resource that requests reboot.
3. A resource that requests reboot is not in desired state until reboot actually happens.
4. After encountering a resource that fails, LCM keeps processing further resources as long as they
   are not dependent on the failure one.
5. The overall status returned by `Get-DscConfigurationStatus` cmdlet is the super set of all
   resources' status.
6. The PendingReboot state is a superset of PendingConfiguration state.

The table below illustrates the resultant state and status related properties under a few typical scenarios.

| Scenario                        | LCMState             | Status     | Reboot Requested | ResourcesInDesiredState   | ResourcesNotInDesiredState |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|------------|---------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| S**^**                          | Idle                 | Success    | $false        | S                            | $null                          |
| F**^**                          | PendingConfiguration | Failure    | $false        | $null                        | F                              |
| S,F                             | PendingConfiguration | Failure    | $false        | S                            | F                              |
| F,S                             | PendingConfiguration | Failure    | $false        | S                            | F                              |
| S<sub>1</sub>, F, S<sub>2</sub> | PendingConfiguration | Failure    | $false        | S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub> | F                              |
| F<sub>1</sub>, S, F<sub>2</sub> | PendingConfiguration | Failure    | $false        | S                            | F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>   |
| S, r                            | PendingReboot        | Success    | $true         | S                            | r                              |
| F, r                            | PendingReboot        | Failure    | $true         | $null                        | F, r                           |
| r, S                            | PendingReboot        | Success    | $true         | $null                        | r                              |
| r, F                            | PendingReboot        | Success    | $true         | $null                        | r                              |

- S<sub>i</sub>: A series of resources that applied successfully
- F<sub>i</sub>: A series of resources that applied unsuccessfully
- r: A resource that requires reboot

```powershell
$LCMState = (Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager).LCMState
$Status = (Get-DscConfigurationStatus).Status

$RebootRequested = (Get-DscConfigurationStatus).RebootRequested

$ResourcesInDesiredState = (Get-DscConfigurationStatus).ResourcesInDesiredState

$ResourcesNotInDesiredState = (Get-DscConfigurationStatus).ResourcesNotInDesiredState
```

## Enhancement in Get-DscConfigurationStatus cmdlet

A few enhancements have been made to `Get-DscConfigurationStatus` cmdlet in this release. Previously, the StartDate property of objects returned by the cmdlet is of String type. Now, it is of Datetime type, which enables complex selecting and filtering easier based on the intrinsic properties of a Datetime object.

```powershell
(Get-DscConfigurationStatus).StartDate | Format-List *

DateTime    : Friday, November 13, 2015 1:39:44 PM
Date        : 11/13/2015 12:00:00 AM
Day         : 13
DayOfWeek   : Friday
DayOfYear   : 317
Hour        : 13
Kind        : Local
Millisecond : 886
Minute      : 39
Month       : 11
Second      : 44
Ticks       : 635830187848860000
TimeOfDay   : 13:39:44.8860000
Year        : 2015
```

The following example returns all DSC operation records that happened on the same day of week as
the current day.

```powershell
(Get-DscConfigurationStatus –All) | Where-Object { $_.startdate.dayofweek -eq (Get-Date).DayOfWeek }
```

Records of operations that do not make changes to node’s configuration (i.e. read only operations)
are eliminated. Therefore, `Test-DscConfiguration`, `Get-DscConfiguration` operations are no longer
adulterated in returned objects from `Get-DscConfigurationStatus` cmdlet. Records of meta
configuration setting operation is added to the return of `Get-DscConfigurationStatus` cmdlet.

Following is an example of result returned from `Get-DscConfigurationStatus –All` cmdlet.

```output
All configuration operations:

Status StartDate Type RebootRequested
------ --------- ---- ---------------
Success 11/13/2015 11:38:16 AM Consistency False
Success 11/13/2015 11:23:16 AM Reboot False
Success 11/13/2015 11:21:43 AM Reboot True
Success 11/13/2015 11:20:44 AM Initial True
Success 11/13/2015 11:20:44 AM LocalConfigurationManager False
```

## Enhancement in Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager cmdlet

A new field of LCMStateDetail is added to the object returned from
`Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager` cmdlet. This field is populated when LCMState is "Busy". It can
be retrieved by following cmdlet:

```powershell
(Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager).LCMStateDetail
```

Following is an example output of a continuous monitoring on a configuration that requires two
reboots on a remote node.

```output
Start a configuration that requires two reboots

Monitor LCM State:
LCM State: Busy, LCM is applying a new configuration.
LCM State: PendingReboot,
Machine is rebooting...
LCM State: Busy, LCM is continuing applying configuration after last reboot.
LCM State: PendingReboot,
Machine is rebooting...
LCM State: Busy, LCM is continuing applying configuration after last reboot.
LCM State: Idle,
LCM State: Busy, LCM is performing a consistency check.
LCM State: Idle,
