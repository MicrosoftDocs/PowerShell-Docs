# Direct access to DSC resource methods


The [Invoke-DscResource](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt517869.aspx) cmdlet has been added to allow direct access to DSC resources and their methods (Get, Set or Test). It can be used by third-parties that want to take advantage of 
DSC resources.

For more information, see [Calling DSC resource methods directly](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/dsc/directcallresource).
