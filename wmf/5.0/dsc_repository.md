# Separation of Configuration, Resource and Report Repositories

In this release we allow you all of the flexibility that you need to pull and report to one or more DSC Pull Servers. Each endpoint can be defined separately so that you can pull
configurations from one location, resources from another and report to yet another location.

For more information, see [Setting up a pull client using configuration ID](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/dsc/pullclientconfigid) or
[Setting up a pull client using configuration names](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/dsc/pullclientconfignames)
