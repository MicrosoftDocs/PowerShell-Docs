# Remove DSC documents

When a configuration document is delivered to DSC, the document goes through various stages (pending, current, previous). We added a new cmdlet to DSC in Windows PowerShell 4.0, 
Remove-DscConfigurationDocument, as part of [KB3000850](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3000850).
