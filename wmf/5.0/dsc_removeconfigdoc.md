# Remove DSC documents

When a configuration document is delivered to DSC, the document goes through various stages (pending, current, previous). We added a new cmdlet to DSC in Windows PowerShell 4.0, `Remove-DscConfigurationDocument`, as part of [November 2014 update rollup for Windows RT 8.1, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3000850).
