# Deliver a configuration document without applying

The [Publish-DscConfiguration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt517875.aspx) cmdlet copies a configuration MOF file to a target node, but does not apply the configuration.
This configuration is applied during the next consistency pass, or when you run the [Update-DscConfiguration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt143541.aspx) cmdlet.
