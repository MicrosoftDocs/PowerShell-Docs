**WMF 4.0 Dependency**

Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and Windows 7 SP1 systems have built-in PowerShell 2.0, WinRM, and WMI. WMF 3.0 and WMF 4.0 packages, which updates these built-in components, were released after the release of Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and Windows 7 SP1. Installing/Uninstalling WMF 3.0 and WMF 4.0 packages uncovered some issues in the following upgrade path:

- Built-in --> WMF 4.0
- Built-in --> WMF 3.0 --> WMF4.0.

We fixed all these issues in WMF 4.0 packages. Hence, there is a prerequisite of WMF 4.0 for installing WMF 5.0 on Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and Windows 7 SP1. Below are the specific issues you might encounter if you do not install WMF 4.0 before upgrading to WMF 5.0:

- Forwarded Events log is unavailable and EventCollector log is not displayed in Event Viewer after you uninstall WMF 3.0 or WMF 5.0 (without the prerequisite WMF 4.0 installed) in Windows 7 SP1 and in Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 ([KB2809215](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2809215)).
- Customization to *PSModulePath* environment variable gets reset to default value when you upgrade directly from built-in PowerShell 2.0 to WMF 5.0 ([KB2872035](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2872035)) or from WMF 3.0 to WMF 5.0. ([KB2872047](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2872047)) in Windows 7 SP1 and in Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.

**WinRM Dependency**

Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) depends on WinRM. WinRM is not enabled by default on Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and Windows 7 SP1. To enable WinRM, in a Windows PowerShell elevated session, run **Set-WSManQuickConfig**.
