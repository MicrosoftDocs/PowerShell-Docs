# Reporting on JEA

In order to report on the state of your JEA configuration, you can use:

1. **Get-PSSessionConfiguration** to return a list of all registered endpoints on a given machine.
2. **Get-PSSessionCapability** to report on the capabilities any given user has on a specific
   endpoint.

Here's an example of **Get-PSSessionCapability**:

```powershell
Get-PSSessionCapability -ConfigurationName Maintenance -Username "CONTOSO\JohnDoe"

CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
Alias           clear -> Clear-Host
Alias           cls -> Clear-Host
Alias           exsn -> Exit-PSSession
Alias           gcm -> Get-Command
Alias           measure -> Measure-Object
Alias           select -> Select-Object
Function        Clear-Host
Function        Exit-PSSession
Function        Get-Command
Function        Get-FormatData
Function        Get-Help
Function        Get-UserInfo
Function        Measure-Object
Function        Out-Default
Function        Select-Object
Cmdlet          Restart-Service                                    3.0.0.0 Microsof...
```

To report on the _actions_ users took during a JEA session, you can:

1. Enable the "over-the-shoulder" transcripts for that JEA endpoint and consult the transcript
   directory for a full log of each user's actions
2. Turn on PowerShell module logging and inspect the PowerShell event logs.
