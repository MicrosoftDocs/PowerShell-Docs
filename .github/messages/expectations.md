# Expectations

Thanks for your submission! Here's a quick note to provide you with some context for what to expect
from the docs team and the process now that you've submitted a PR. Even if you've contributed to
this repo before, we strongly suggest reading this information; it might have changed since you last
read it.

To see our process for reviewing PRs, please read our [editor's checklist][contrib-checklist] and
process for [managing pull requests][contrib-managing-prs] in particular. Below is a brief,
high-level summary of what to expect, but our contributor guide has expanded details.

The docs team begins to review your PR if you [request them to][gh-review-request] or if your PR
meets these conditions:

- It is not a [draft PR][gh-drafts].
- It does not have a `WIP` prefix in the title.
- It passes validation and build steps.
- It does not have any merge conflicts.
- You have checked every box in the [PR Checklist](#pr-checklist), indicating you have completed all
  required steps and marked your PR as **Ready to Merge**.

You can **always** request a review at any stage in your authoring process, the docs team is here to
help! You do not need to submit a fully polished and finished draft; the docs team can help you get
content ready for merge.

While reviewing your PR, the docs team may make suggestions, write comments, and ask questions. When
all requirements are satisfied, the docs team marks your PR as **Approved** and merges it. Once your
PR is merged, it is included the next time the documentation is published. For this project, the
documentation is published daily at 3 p.m. Pacific Standard Time (PST).
