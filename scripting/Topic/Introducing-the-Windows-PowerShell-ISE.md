# Introducing the Windows PowerShell ISE
The [!INCLUDE[mshgraphicalhost](../Token/mshgraphicalhost_md.md)] is a host application for [!INCLUDE[mshshort](../Token/mshshort_md.md)]. In [!INCLUDE[mshgraphicalhostshort](../Token/mshgraphicalhostshort_md.md)], you can run commands and write, test, and debug scripts in a single Windows\-based graphic user interface with multiline editing, tab completion, syntax coloring, selective execution, context\-sensitive help, and support for right\-to\-left languages.
You can use menu items and keyboard shortcuts to perform many of the same tasks that you would perform in the [!INCLUDE[psconsole](../Token/psconsole_md.md)].  For example, when you debug a script in the [!INCLUDE[mshgraphicalhostshort](../Token/mshgraphicalhostshort_md.md)], to set a line breakpoint in a script, right\-click the line of code, and then click **Toggle Breakpoint**.

Try these features in [!INCLUDE[mshgraphicalhostshort](../Token/mshgraphicalhostshort_md.md)].

-   Multiline editing: To insert a blank line under the current line in the Command pane, press SHIFT\+ENTER.

-   Selective execution: To run part of a script, select the text you want to run, and then click the **Run Script** button. Or, press F5.

-   Context\-sensitive help: Type **Invoke\-Item**, and then press F1. The Help file opens to the Help topic for the **Invoke\-Item** cmdlet.

The [!INCLUDE[mshgraphicalhostshort](../Token/mshgraphicalhostshort_md.md)] lets you customize some aspects of its appearance. It also has its own [!INCLUDE[mshshort](../Token/mshshort_md.md)] profile, where you can store functions, aliases, variables, and commands you use in the [!INCLUDE[mshgraphicalhostshort](../Token/mshgraphicalhostshort_md.md)].

### To start the Windows PowerShell ISE

1.  Do one of the following:

    -   Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Windows PowerShell V2**, and then click **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

    -   In the [!INCLUDE[psconsole](../Token/psconsole_md.md)] Cmd.exe, or in the Run box, type, **powershell\_ise.exe**.

### To get Help in the Windows PowerShell ISE

-   On the **Help** menu, click **Windows PowerShell Help**. Or, press F1. The file that opens describes Windows PowerShell ISE and Windows PowerShell, including all of the help available from the Get\-Help cmdlet.
