# The ISEEditor Object
  An **ISEEditor** object is an instance of the Microsoft.PowerShell.Host.ISE.ISEEditor class. The Console pane is an **ISEEditor** object. Each [ISEFile](The-ISEFile-Object.md) object has an associated **ISEEditor** object. The following sections list the methods and properties of an **ISEEditor** object.

## Methods

### Clear\(\)
  Supported in Windows PowerShell ISE 2.0 and later. 

 Clears the text in the editor.

```
# Clears the text in the Console pane.
$psIse.CurrentPowerShellTab.ConsolePane.Clear()

```

### EnsureVisible\(int lineNumber\)
  Supported in Windows PowerShell ISE 2.0 and later. 

 Scrolls the editor so that the line that corresponds to the specified **lineNumber** parameter value is visible. It throws an exception if the specified line number is outside the range of 1,last line number, which defines the valid line numbers.

 **lineNumber**
 The number of the line that is to be made visible.

```
# Scrolls the text in the Script pane so that the fifth line is in view. 
$psIse.CurrentFile.Editor.EnsureVisible(5)

```

### Focus\(\)
  Supported in Windows PowerShell ISE 2.0 and later. 

 Sets the focus to the editor.

```
# Sets focus to the Console pane. 
$psISE.CurrentPowerShellTab.ConsolePane.Focus()
```

### GetLineLength\(int lineNumber \)
  Supported in Windows PowerShell ISE 2.0 and later. 

 Gets the line length as an integer for the line that is specified by the line number.

 **lineNumber**
 The number of the line of which to get the length.

 **Returns**
 The line length for the line at the specified line number.

```
# Gets the length of the first line in the text of the Command pane. 
$psIse.CurrentPowerShellTab.ConsolePane.GetLineLength(1)
```

### GoToMatch\(\)
  Supported in Windows PowerShell ISE 3.0 and later, and not present in earlier versions. 

 Moves the caret to the matching character if the **CanGoToMatch** property of the editor object is **$true**, which occurs when the caret is immediately before an opening parenthesis, bracket, or brace \- \(,\[,{ \- or immediately after a closing parenthesis, bracket, or brace \- \),\],}.  The caret is placed before an opening character or after a closing character. If the **CanGoToMatch** property is **$false**, then this method does nothing. See [CanGoToMatch](#cangotomatch).

```
# Test to see if the caret is next to a parenthesis, bracket, or brace.
```

### InsertText\( text \)
  Supported in Windows PowerShell ISE 2.0 and later. 

 Replaces the selection with text or inserts text at the current caret position.

 **text** \- String
 The text to insert.

 See the [Scripting Example](#example) later in this topic.

### Select\( startLine, startColumn, endLine, endColumn \)
  Supported in Windows PowerShell ISE 2.0 and later. 

 Selects the text from the **startLine**, **startColumn**, **endLine**, and **endColumn** parameters.

 **startLine** \- Integer
 The line where the selection starts.

 **startColumn** \- Integer
 The column within the start line where the selection starts.

 **endLine** \- Integer
 The line where the selection ends.

 **endColumn** \- Integer
 The column within the end line where the selection ends.

 See the  [Scripting Example](#example) later in this topic.

### SelectCaretLine\(\)
  Supported in Windows PowerShell ISE 2.0 and later. 

 Selects the entire line of text that currently contains the caret.

```
# First, set the caret position on line 5.
$psIse.CurrentFile.Editor.SetCaretPosition(5,1) 
# Now select that entire line of text
$psIse.CurrentFile.Editor.SelectCaretLine()

```

### SetCaretPosition\( lineNumber, columnNumber \)
  Supported in Windows PowerShell ISE 2.0 and later. 

 Sets the caret position at the line number and the column number. It throws an exception if either the caret line number  or the caret column number  are out of their respective valid ranges.

 **lineNumber** \- Integer
 The caret line number.

 **columnNumber** \- Integer
 The caret column number.

```
# Set the CaretPosition.
$psIse.CurrentFile.Editor.SetCaretPosition(5,1)
```

### ToggleOutliningExpansion\(\)

# This illustrates how you can use the length of a line to

$myEditor=$psIse.CurrentFile.Editor
# Clear the text in the current file editor.
$myEditor.Clear()

# Make sure the file has five lines of text.
$myEditor.InsertText("LINE1 `n")
$myEditor.InsertText("LINE2 `n")
$myEditor.InsertText("LINE3 `n")
$myEditor.InsertText("LINE4 `n")
$myEditor.InsertText("LINE5 `n")

# Use the GetLineLength method to get the length of the third line. 
$endColumn= $myEditor.GetLineLength(3)
# Select the text in the first three lines.
$myEditor.Select(1,1,3,$endColumn + 1)
