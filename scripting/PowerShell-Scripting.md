#  PowerShell

Built on the .NET Framework,
Windows PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language;
it is designed specifically for system administrators and power-users,
to rapidly automate the administration of multiple operating systems
(Linux, OSX, Unix, and Windows)
and the processes related to the applications that run on those operating systems.

###  PowerShell is now open source

PowerShell base source code is now available in GitHub and open to community
contributions, see [PowerShell](https://github.com/powershell/powershell).

You can start with the bits you need at [get PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#get-powershell).
Or, perhaps, with a quick tour at [Getting Started](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/learning-powershell)

>  **Note:**  
>  All links about PowerShell in GitHub will take you to GitHub.
