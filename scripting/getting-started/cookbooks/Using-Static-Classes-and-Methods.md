# Using Static Classes and Methods
Not all .NET Framework classes can be created by using **New-Object**. For example, if you try to create a **System.Environment** or a **System.Math** object with **New-Object**, you will get the following error messages:

```
PS> New-Object System.Environment
New-Object : Constructor not found. Cannot find an appropriate constructor for
type System.Environment.
At line:1 char:11
+ New-Object  <<<< System.Environment
PS> New-Object System.Math
New-Object : Constructor not found. Cannot find an appropriate constructor for
type System.Math.
At line:1 char:11
+ New-Object  <<<< System.Math
```

These errors occur because there is no way to create a new object from these classes. These classes are reference libraries of methods and properties that do not change state. You don't need to create them, you simply use them. Classes and methods such as these are called *static classes* because they are not created, destroyed, or changed. To make this clear we will provide examples that use static classes.

### Getting Environment Data with System.Environment
Usually, the first step in working with an object in Windows PowerShell is to use Get-Member to find out what members it contains. With static classes, the process is a little different because the actual class is not an object.

#### Referring to the Static System.Environment Class
You can refer to a static class by surrounding the class name with square brackets. For example, you can refer to **System.Environment** by typing the name within brackets. Doing so displays some generic type information:

```
PS> [System.Environment]

IsPublic IsSerial Name                                     BaseType
-------- -------- ----                                     --------
True     False    Environment                              System.Object
```

> [!NOTE]
> As we mentioned previously, Windows PowerShell automatically prepends '**System.**' to type names when you use **New-Object**. The same thing happens when using a bracketed type name, so you can specify **\[System.Environment]** as **\[Environment]**.

The **System.Environment** class contains general information about the working environment for the current process, which is powershell.exe when working within Windows PowerShell.

If you try to view details of this class by typing **\[System.Environment] | Get-Member**, the object type is reported as being **System.RuntimeType** , not **System.Environment**:

```
PS> [System.Environment] | Get-Member

   TypeName: System.RuntimeType
```

To view static members with Get-Member, specify the **Static** parameter:

```
PS> [System.Environment] | Get-Member -Static

   TypeName: System.Environment

Name                       MemberType Definition
----                       ---------- ----------
Equals                     Method     static System.Boolean Equals(Object ob...
Exit                       Method     static System.Void Exit(Int32 exitCode)
...
CommandLine                Property   static System.String CommandLine {get;}
CurrentDirectory           Property   static System.String CurrentDirectory ...
ExitCode                   Property   static System.Int32 ExitCode {get;set;}

MachineName                Property   static System.String MachineName {get;}
NewLine                    Property   static System.String NewLine {get;}
OSVersion                  Property   static System.OperatingSystem OSVersio...
ProcessorCount             Property   static System.Int32 ProcessorCount {get;}
StackTrace                 Property   static System.String StackTrace {get;}
SystemDirectory            Property   static System.String SystemDirectory {...
TickCount                  Property   static System.Int32 TickCount {get;}
UserDomainName             Property   static System.String UserDomainName {g...
UserInteractive            Property   static System.Boolean UserInteractive ...
UserName                   Property   static System.String UserName {get;}
Version                    Property   static System.Version Version {get;}
WorkingSet                 Property   static System.Int64 WorkingSet {get;}
TickCount                               ExitCode
```

We can now select properties to view from System.Environment.

#### Displaying Static Properties of System.Environment
The properties of System.Environment are also static, and must be specified in a different way than normal properties. We use **::** to indicate to Windows PowerShell that we want to work with a static method or property. To see the command that was used to launch Windows PowerShell, we check the **CommandLine** property by typing:

```
PS> [System.Environment]::Commandline
"C:\Program Files\Windows PowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe"
```

To check the operating system version, display the OSVersion property by typing:

```
PS> [System.Environment]::OSVersion

           Platform ServicePack         Version             VersionString
           -------- -----------         -------             -------------
            Win32NT Service Pack 2      5.1.2600.131072     Microsoft Windows...
```

We can check whether the computer is in the process of shutting down by displaying the **HasShutdownStarted** property:

```
PS> [System.Environment]::HasShutdownStarted
False
```

### Doing Math with System.Math
The System.Math static class is useful for performing some mathematical operations. The important members of **System.Math** are mostly methods, which we can display by using **Get-Member**.

> [!NOTE]
> System.Math has several methods with the same name, but they are distinguished by the type of their parameters.

Type the following command to list the methods of the **System.Math** class.

```
PS> [System.Math] | Get-Member -Static -MemberType Methods

   TypeName: System.Math

```

This displays several mathematical methods. Here is a list of commands that demonstrate how some of the common methods work:

```
PS> [System.Math]::Sqrt(9)
3
PS> [System.Math]::Pow(2,3)
8
PS> [System.Math]::Floor(3.3)
3
PS> [System.Math]::Floor(-3.3)
-4
PS> [System.Math]::Ceiling(3.3)
4
PS> [System.Math]::Ceiling(-3.3)
-3
PS> [System.Math]::Max(2,7)
7
PS> [System.Math]::Min(2,7)
2
PS> [System.Math]::Truncate(9.3)
9
PS> [System.Math]::Truncate(-9.3)
-9
```
