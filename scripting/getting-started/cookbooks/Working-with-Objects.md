# Working with Objects
We have discussed how Windows PowerShell uses objects to transfer data between cmdlets, and demonstrated a few ways to view detailed information about objects by using Get-Member and Format cmdlets to view particular properties of objects.

The power of objects is that they provide you with access to a lot of complex data, and it is already correlated. With some simple techniques you can further manipulate objects to do even more work. We are going to look at some specific types of objects and ways you can manipulate them in this chapter.
