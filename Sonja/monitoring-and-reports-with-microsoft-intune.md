# Monitoring and reports with Microsoft Intune
Intune offers an IT admin two ways to monitor an organization's devices. Monitoring includes the status of software licenses and actions that affect devices, like wiping a device.

-   **[Reports](../deploy-use/understand-microsoft-intune-operations-by-using-reports.md)** help you monitor the status of devices that are managed by Intune. This includes software update status, an inventory of the software that is installed, and certificate compliance.
    Â With Intune reports, you also can see the hardware inventory for all devices and computers.

-   **[Alerts](../deploy-use/get-notified-by-alerts.md)** help you monitor the health of devices that are managed by Intune. This includes Endpoint Protection status and warnings to alert you to malware, and warnings that are related to limited disk space or network connectivity.

Devices and computers that are managed by Intune return detailed information about their properties and installed software. With Intune, you have the tools and reports to examine and present the information. For details, see [Understand your devices with inventory in Microsoft Intune](../deploy-use/understand-your-devices-with-inventory-in-microsoft-intune.md).
