# Manage Windows PCs with Intune PC client software
Instead of [enrolling Windows PCs as mobile devices](set-up-windows-device-management-with-microsoft-intune.md), you can enroll and manage Windows PCs by installing the Intune client software.

Intune manages Windows PCs using policies similar to the way Windows Server Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Group Policy Objects (GPOs) do. If you will be managing Active Directory domain-joined computers with Intune, you should [be sure that Intune policies do not conflict with any GPOs](resolve-gpo-and-microsoft-intune-policy-conflicts.md) that are in place for your organization.

While the Intune software client supports [management capabilities that help protect PCs](policies-to-protect-windows-pcs-in-microsoft-intune.md) by managing software updates, Windows firewall, and Endpoint Protection, PCs managed with the Intune software client cannot be targeted with other Intune policies, including those **Windows** policy settings specific to mobile device management.

> [!NOTE]
> Devices running Windows 8.1 or later can be managed with either the Intune client or as mobile devices. This topic applies to computers running the Intune software client. Installing the Intune client and enrolling in mobile device management is not supported.

|Remove incompatible client software|Before you install the Intune client software, you must uninstall the any Configuration Manager or System Management Server client software from that PC.|

## Computer management with the Intune computer client
After the Intune client software is installed, management capabilities include: [application management](deploy-apps-in-microsoft-intune.md), [real-time monitoring and Endpoint Protection](help-secure-windows-pcs-with-endpoint-protection-for-microsoft-intune.md), [Windows Firewall settings management](help-protect-windows-pcs-using-windows-firewall-policies-in-microsoft-intune.md), hardware and software inventory, remote control (through remote assistance requests), [software update settings](keep-windows-pcs-up-to-date-with-software-updates-in-microsoft-intune.md), and compliance settings reporting.

Certain management options available to PCs managed as mobile devices are unavailable to the software client-managed PCs including:

-   Full wipe (selective wipe is available)
-   Conditional access
-   Windows policies other than **Computer management** policies

In addition to the Intune client agent actions taken locally on individual computers, you can also use the Intune admin console to perform other [common computer management tasks](common-windows-pc-management-tasks-with-the-microsoft-intune-computer-client.md) on Windows PCs with the client installed to:

-   View hardware and software inventory information about managed computers

-   Remotely restart a computer

-   Retire a computer to uninstall the client software and remove it from management with Intune

-   Link users to specific managed computers

-   Respond to remote assistance requests

The Intune client agent usually runs quietly in the background without the need for much user interaction or troubleshooting. However, should you need help in resolving computer management issues, there are several [resources available to help you solve them](/intune/troubleshoot/troubleshoot-client-setup-in-microsoft-intune).
