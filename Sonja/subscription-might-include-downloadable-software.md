# Your paid Microsoft Intune or Enterprise Mobility subscription might include a license to use certain downloadable software

The following software might be included in your paid Microsoft Online Services subscription.  You can confirm which software you are licensed for by reviewing your agreement terms.

| **Microsoft Service**    | **On-premises software**           |
| ------------- |-------------|
|Enterprise Mobility Suite |	Advanced Threat Analytics |
|Enterprise Mobility Suite |	Microsoft Identity Manager |
|Microsoft Intune |	System Center Configuration Manager |
|Azure Active Directory Premium |	Microsoft Identity Manager |

The location to download the above software will depend on the method you purchased your Microsoft Online Service.

If you have purchased via an Account Agreement or have prepaid through a Microsoft Certified Partner, then you should have received email after activating your product which included a link to the [Volume License download portal](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx).

If you have purchased directly with a credit card or through a Cloud Solutions Provider, then you will download software from the [Microsoft Online Software Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/online/downloads/HomeRealmDiscovery.aspx).

If you are unsure which software you qualify for, contact your account executive or partner or reach out to [Microsoft Online Services support](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/dn932057.aspx).

If you instead signed up for a trial, you can obtain trial versions of these by visiting the [TechNet Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/try).
