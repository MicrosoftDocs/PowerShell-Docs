# Common Windows PC management tasks with the Intune software client
Review the tasks in this topic to learn how to manage your computers that run the Intune software client. If you have not yet installed the client on your computers, see [Install the Intune software client](install-the-windows-pc-client-with-microsoft-intune.md).


## Use policies to simplify PC management

Windows PCs running the Intune software client can be managed using Intune's **Computer Management** policies.

![Policies template for Windows PCs](../media/pc_policy_template.png)

### Manage the Microsoft Intune Center
Users see the Intune software client as the **Microsoft Intune Center**. The Microsoft Intune Center lets users:

-   Get applications from the company portal.

-   Check for updates.

-   Manage Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection.

-  Request remote assistance.

The Microsoft Intune Center is installed on all managed computers. You can configure the following settings in an Intune policy and these are displayed to users in the Microsoft Intune Center:

|Policy setting|Details|
|------------------|--------------------|
|**Name**|The name of the administrator who manages the computer.<br /><br />Maximum length: 40 characters|
|**Phone number**|The telephone number of the administrator who manages the computer.<br /><br />Maximum length: 20 characters|
|**Email address**|The email address of the administrator who manages the computer.<br /><br />Maximum length: 40 characters|
|**Web site name**|The name of your support website for users.<br /><br />Maximum length: 40 characters|
|**Web site URL**|The URL of your support website.<br /><br />Maximum length: 150 characters|
|**Notes**|A note that is displayed to users.<br /><br />Maximum length: 120 characters|

## Software updates settings
Use policies to configure the settings that managed computers use to check for, and download software updates from Microsoft and from third-parties. These updates do not include operating system upgrades (i.e. upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10, or upgrades from one Windows 10 version to a later version). For more information, see [Keep Windows PCs up to date with software updates in Microsoft Intune](keep-windows-pcs-up-to-date-with-software-updates-in-microsoft-intune.md).

### Endpoint Protection settings
Use policies to configure settings for Endpoint Protection that you then deploy to managed computers. This includes scan schedules, actions to take when malware is detected, and more. For more information, see [Help secure Windows PCs with Endpoint Protection for Microsoft Intune](help-secure-windows-pcs-with-endpoint-protection-for-microsoft-intune.md).

## Windows Firewall settings
Policies simplify the administration of Windows Firewall settings on managed computers. For details, see [Help protect Windows PCs using Windows Firewall policies in Microsoft Intune](help-protect-windows-pcs-using-windows-firewall-policies-in-microsoft-intune.md).

## View hardware and software inventory
Intune collects detailed information about the hardware and software of managed computers. Use the information in the following procedures to learn how to create:

-   A report that lists information about the hardware capabilities of your computers.

-   A report that lists the software installed on each computer.

-   How to refresh a computers inventory to ensure that the data in the report is current.

### To display information about your computers

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), choose **Reports** &gt; **Computer Inventory Reports**.

2.  On the **Create New Report** page, accept the default values or customize them to filter the results that will be returned by the report. For example, you could select that only computers that run Windows 8.1 will be displayed in the report.

3.  Choose **View Report** to open the **Computer Inventory Report** in a new window.

    You can sort the report by any of the columns, like **Name**, **Chassis Type** or **Manufacturer** by selecting each column heading.

### To display software installed on your computers

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), choose **Reports** &gt; **Detected Software Reports**.

2.  On the **Create New Report** page, accept the default values or customize them to filter the results that will be returned by the report. For example, you could select that only software published by Microsoft will be displayed in the report.

3.  Choose **View Report** to open the **Detected Software Report** in a new window.

    You can sort the report by any of the columns, like **Name**, **Publisher** or **Category** by selecting each column heading. You can expand the updates in the list to show more detail (such as the computers on which it is installed) by choosing the directional arrow next to the list item.

### To refresh computer inventory to ensure it is current

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), choose **Groups** &gt; **All Devices** (or another group that contains the computer for which you want to refresh inventory).

2.  Select a computer, or press and hold **Ctrl** to select multiple computers.

3.  On the taskbar, choose **Remote Tasks** &gt; **Refresh Inventory**.

4.  To view the task status, choose **Remote Tasks** in the bottom right corner of the page.

    The **Task Status** dialog box displays showing current remote tasks, task status, device name, and any reported errors, and provides a link to troubleshooting information.


## Remotely restart a Windows PC

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), choose **Groups** &gt; **All Devices** (or another group that contains the computer you want to restart).

2.  Select one or more computers, and then choose **Remote Tasks** &gt; **Restart Computer**.

3.  To view the task status, choose **Remote Tasks** in the bottom right corner of the page.

4.  In the **Task Status** dialog box, review the current remote tasks, task status, device name, and any reported errors.

## Retire a computer

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), choose **Groups** &gt; **All Devices** (or another group that contains the computer you want to retire).

2.  Select the devices you want to retire, and then choose **Retire/Wipe**.

To re-enroll a computer into Intune, reinstall the software client on the PC using guidance in [Install the Windows PC client with Microsoft Intune](install-the-windows-pc-client-with-microsoft-intune.md).

If a computer cannot connect to Intune, a message is displayed in the **Dashboard** workspace.

When you retire a computer:

-   It is removed from the Intune management and inventory, and the license associated with the computer is made available for re-use. Retire/Wipe removes the Intune software client but does not remove apps or data from the computer. This retirement does not perform a full wipe on the computer.

-   Its status no longer displays in the Intune console.

-   Intune removes the software client from the computer. If the computer is not connected to the Intune service, the software client will be removed next time it connects.

-   Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection is removed from the computer. If the computer has another endpoint application installed and it is disabled, that application can be re-enabled after Microsoft Intune Endpoint Protection is removed to ensure that your computers are protected.

-   Any policies are removed from the computer and the values that were set by the policy will be changed.

-   The computer no longer receives software updates or malware definition updates from the Intune service.

-   Depending on how they are configured, retired computers can continue to receive updates by using Windows Server Update Services, Windows Update, or Microsoft Update.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If the client software was installed by using a Group Policy Object (GPO), you must remove the Group Policy Object (GPO) before you can remove the client software to prevent the software from being reinstalled.

    If the client fails to uninstall, read [Troubleshoot Endpoint Protection](/intune/troubleshoot/troubleshoot-endpoint-protection-in-microsoft-intune) for more help.

## Manage user-device linking
Before you can deploy software to a user, you must link the user to a computer. You can link a user to multiple computers, but each computer can be linked to only one user. Users are automatically linked to any computers that they enroll in Intune by using the company portal.

### To link a user to a computer

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com/), choose **Groups** &gt; **All Devices** (or another group that contains the computer you want to link to a user).

2.  Select the computer that you want to link a user, and then choose **Link User**.

    The **Link User** dialog box displays a list of available users with their display name, user ID, and the number of computers to which each user is currently linked. If a user is already linked to the selected computer, that userâ€™s name and user ID are displayed under **Current user**. If the computer is not linked to any user, **No User** appears under **Current User**.

3.  Do one of the following:

    -   To leave the computer linked to its current user, if there is one, choose **Cancel**.

    -   To remove the link to the current user, if there is one, choose **Remove link **&gt; **OK**.

    -   To link the computer to a new user, in the **All users** list, select a user. Confirm that the user data is correct, and then choose **OK**.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to restrict end users ability to link themselves to computers, enable the option **Restrict users' ability to link themselves to computers** in the **Microsoft Intune Agent Settings** policy.

## Request and provide remote assistance for Windows PCs

Microsoft Intune can use the [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com) software, purchased separately, to let users of PCs that run the Intune software client get remote assistance help from you. When a user requests help from the Microsoft Intune Center, you are informed by an alert, can accept the request, and then provide assistance.
This functionality replaces the existing Windows Remote Assistance functionality in Intune.


### Before you start

Before you begin to establish and respond to remote assistance requests, you must ensure the following prerequisites are in place:

- You must have [signed up for a TeamViewer account](https://login.teamviewer.com/LogOn#register) to log into the TeamViewer website.
- Windows PCs that you want to administer must be [managed by the Windows PC client](manage-windows-pcs-with-microsoft-intune.md)
- All Windows PC operating systems supported by Intune can be administered.

### Configure the TeamViewer Connector

1. In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), choose **Admin**.
2. In the **Admin** workspace, choose **TeamViewer**.
3. On the **TeamViewer** page, under **TeamViewer Connector**, choose **Enable**.
4. In the **Enable TeamViewer** dialog box, view, then **Accept** the license terms. If you don't already own a TeamViewer license, choose **Purchase a TeamViewer license**.
5. After the TeamViewer browser window opens, sign into the site with your TeamViewer credentials.
6. On the TeamViewer site, read, then accept the options to allow Intune to connect with TeamViewer.
7. In the Intune console, verify that the **TeamViewer Connector** item shows as **Enabled**.


### Open a remote assistance request (end user)

1. On a client Windows PC, open the **Microsoft Intune Center**.
2. Under **Remote Assistance**, choose **Request Remote Assistance**.
3. After you approve the request (see below), TeamViewer opens on the client. The user must accept any messages indicating that the web browser is trying to open the TeamViewer application.
4. The user sees a message asking if you can control their PC. They must accept this message to continue.
5. During the remote assistance session, the user sees a window that shows them you are connected. If they close this window, the remote session ends.

### Respond to a remote assistance request

1. When a user submits a remote assistance request, you can view it in the **Alerts** workspace, under **Monitoring** > **Remote Assistance**. For example:
> ![Screenshot of a remote assistance request](./media/team-viewer.png)

<br>If a request goes unanswered for more than 4 hours, it is removed.
2. To accept the request, choose **Approve request and launch Remote Assistance**.
3. In the **A New Remote Assistance Request is Pending** dialog box, choose **Accept the remote assistance request**. If it's not already installed, TeamViewer will install any necessary apps on your computer.
4. TeamViewer then notifies the end user that you want to take control of their PC. After the user has accepted the request, the TeamViewer windows opens, and you can control the PC.

While in a remote assistance session, you can use all available TeamViewer commands to control the remote PC. For help with these commands, download the [Manual for remote control](http://www.teamviewer.com/en/support/documents/) from the TeamViewer website.

### Close the remote assistance session

From the **Actions** menu of the **TeamViewer** window, choose **End Session**.
