# What to tell your end users about using Microsoft Intune

Use these links and information to:

- Understand the steps that your users follow to do different tasks in Intune.
- Give to your users to help them complete tasks and solve issues they have while using Intune.

Be sure that you include the IT administrator's contact information when you [customize the Company Portal](/Intune/get-started/start-with-a-paid-subscription-to-microsoft-intune-step-7) so that your users can get help if they need it.


## Where your end users can find information about common tasks

When enrolled users need help using Intune, they typically see a link in the Company Portal website or Company Portal app that points them to a specific article with steps on how to fix the issue or complete the task. For example, if Android users see a message saying that they are missing a required certificate, they can tap a "How to resolve this" link to go to an article with steps on how to get the certificate. 

The links below are for IT administrators. These pages contain links to all of the articles that users are sent to when from the Company Portal website or app. The link are divided into sections: Company Portal app installation and Intune enrollment; tasks that users can do on their devices, like using managed apps and manually syncing their devices; and troubleshooting.

- [Using your iOS or Mac OS X device with Intune](/Intune/EndUser/using-your-ios-or-mac-os-x-device-with-intune)
- [Using your Windows device with Intune](/Intune/EndUser/using-your-windows-device-with-intune)
- [Using the Intune Company Portal website](/Intune/EndUser/using-the-intune-company-portal-website)

Has sections on how to enroll Android, iOS, and Windows devices, get apps, unenroll, what to do if you lose your device, and what IT Pros can and can't see on your device.

## Help end users understand Company Portal app messages
