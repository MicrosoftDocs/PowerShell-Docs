# JEA Role Capabilities

> Applies to: Windows PowerShell 5.0

When creating a JEA endpoint, you will need to define one or more "role capabilities" which describe *what* someone can do in a JEA session.
A role capability is a PowerShell data file with the .psrc extension that lists all the cmdlets, functions, providers, and external programs that should be made available to connecting users.

This topic describes how to create a PowerShell role capability file for your JEA users.

## Determine which commands to allow

The first step when creating a role capability file is to consider what the users who are assigned the role will need access to.
This requirements gathering process can take a while, but it is a very important process.
Giving users access to too few cmdlets and functions can prevent them from getting their job done.
Allowing access to too many cmdlets and functions can lead to users doing more than you intended with their implicit admin privileges, weakening your security stance.

How you go about this process will depend on your organization and goals, however the following tips can help ensure you're on the right path.

1. **Identify** the commands users are using to get their jobs done. This may involve surveying IT staff, checking automation scripts, or analyzing PowerShell session transcripts or logs.
2. **Update** use of command line tools to PowerShell equivalents, where possible, for the best auditing and JEA customization experience. External programs cannot be constrained as granularly as native PowerShell cmdlets and functions in JEA.
3. **Restrict** the scope of the cmdlets if necessary to only allow specific parameters or parameter values. This is particularly important if users should only be able to manage part of a system.
4. **Create** custom functions to replace complex commands or commands which are difficult to constrain in JEA. A simple function that wraps a complex command or applies additional validation logic can offer additional control for admins and end-user simplicity.
5. **Test** the scoped list of allowable commands with your users and/or automation services and adjust as necessary.

It is important to remember that commands in a JEA session are often run with admin (or otherwise elevated) privileges.
Careful selection of available commands is important to ensure the JEA endpoint does not allow the connecting user to elevate their permissions.
Below are some examples of commands that can be used maliciously if allowed in an unconstrained state.
Note that this is not an exhaustive list and should only be used as a cautionary starting point.

### Examples of potentially dangerous commands

Risk | Example | Related commands
-----|---------|-----------------
Granting the connecting user admin privileges to bypass JEA | `Add-LocalGroupMember -Member 'CONTOSO\jdoe' -Group 'Administrators'` | `Add-ADGroupMember`, `Add-LocalGroupMember`, `net.exe`, `dsadd.exe`
Running arbitrary code, such as malware, exploits, or custom scripts to bypass protections | `Start-Process -FilePath '\\san\share\malware.exe'` | `Start-Process`, `New-Service`, `Invoke-Item`, `Invoke-WmiMethod`, `Invoke-CimMethod`, `Invoke-Expression`, `Invoke-Command`, `New-ScheduledTask`, `Register-ScheduledJob`

## Create a role capability file

You can create a new PowerShell role capability file with the [New-PSRoleCapabilityFile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/reference/5.1/microsoft.powershell.core/New-PSRoleCapabilityFile) cmdlet.

```powershell
New-PSRoleCapabilityFile -Path .\MyFirstJEARole.psrc
```

The resulting role capability file can be opened in a text editor and modified to allow the desired commands for the role.
The PowerShell help documentation contains several examples of how you can configure the file.

### Allowing PowerShell cmdlets and functions

To authorize users to run PowerShell cmdlets or functions, add the cmdlet or function name to the VisbibleCmdlets or VisibleFunctions fields.
If you aren't sure whether a command is a cmdlet or function, you can run `Get-Command <name>` and check the "CommandType" property in the output.

```powershell
VisibleCmdlets = 'Restart-Computer', 'Get-NetIPAddress'
```

Sometimes the scope of a specific cmdlet or function is too broad for your users' needs.
A DNS admin, for example, probably only needs access to restart the DNS service.
In a multi-tenant environment where tenants are granted access to self-service management tools, tenants should be limited to managing with their own resources.
For these cases, you can restrict which parameters are exposed from the cmdlet or function.

```powershell

VisibleCmdlets = @{ Name = 'Restart-Computer'; Parameters = @{ Name = 'Name' }}

```

In more advanced scenarios, you may also need to restrict which values someone can supply to these parameters.
Role capabilities let you define a set of allowed values or a regular expression pattern that is evaluated to determine if a given input is allowed.

```powershell
VisibleCmdlets = @{ Name = 'Restart-Service'; Parameters = @{ Name = 'Name'; ValidateSet = 'Dns', 'Spooler' }},
                 @{ Name = 'Start-Website'; Parameters = @{ Name = 'Name'; ValidatePattern = 'HR_*' }}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The [common PowerShell parameters](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847884.aspx) are always allowed, even if you restrict the available parameters.
> You should not explicitly list them in the Parameters field.

The table below describes the various ways you can customize a visible cmdlet or function.
You can mix and match any of the below in the VisibleCmdlets field.

Example                                                                                      | Use case
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`'My-Func'` or `@{ Name = 'My-Func' }`                                                       | Allows the user to run `My-Func` without any restrictions on the parameters.
`'MyModule\My-Func'`                                                                         | Allows the user to run `My-Func` from the module `MyModule` without any restrictions on the parameters.
`'My-*'`                                                                                     | Allows the user to run any cmdlet or function with the verb `My`.
`'*-Func'`                                                                                   | Allows the user to run any cmdlet or function with the noun `Func`.
`@{ Name = 'My-Func'; Parameters = @{ Name = 'Param1'}, @{ Name = 'Param2' }}`               | Allows the user to run `My-Func` with the `Param1` and/or `Param2` parameters. Any value can be supplied to the parameters.
`@{ Name = 'My-Func'; Parameters = @{ Name = 'Param1'; ValidateSet = 'Value1', 'Value2' }}`  | Allows the user to run `My-Func` with the `Param1` parameter. Only "Value1" and "Value2" can be supplied to the parameter.
`@{ Name = 'My-Func'; Parameters = @{ Name = 'Param1'; ValidatePattern = 'contoso.*' }}`     | Allows the user to run `My-Func` with the `Param1` parameter. Any value starting with "contoso" can be supplied to the parameter.


> [!WARNING]
> For best security practices, it is not recommended to use wildcards when defining visible cmdlets or functions.
> Instead, you should explicitly list each trusted command to ensure no other commands that share the same naming scheme are unintentionally authorized.

You cannot apply both a ValidatePattern and ValidateSet to the same cmdlet or function.

If you do, the ValidatePattern will override the ValidateSet.

For more information about ValidatePattern, check out [this *Hey, Scripting Guy!* post](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/2011/01/11/validate-powershell-parameters-before-running-the-script/) and the [PowerShell Regular Expressions](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh847880.aspx) reference content.

### Allowing external commands and PowerShell scripts

To allow users to run executables and PowerShell scripts (.ps1) in a JEA session, you have to add the full path to each program in the VisibleExternalCommands field.

```powershell
VisibleExternalCommands = 'C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe', 'C:\Program Files\Contoso\Scripts\UpdateITSoftware.ps1'
```

It is advised, where possible, to use PowerShell cmdlet/function equivalents of any external executables you authorize since you have control over which parameters are allowed with PowerShell cmdlets/functions.

Many executables allow you to both read the current state and then change it just by providing different parameters.

For example, consider the role of a file server admin who wants to check which network shares are hosted by the local machine.
One way to check is to use `net share`.
However, allowing net.exe is very dangerous becuase the admin could just as easily use the command to gain admin privileges with `net group Administrators unprivilegedjeauser /add`.
A better approach is to allow [Get-SmbShare](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj635704.aspx) which achieves the same result but has a much more limited scope.

When making external commands available to users in a JEA session, always specify the complete path to the executable to ensure a similarly named (and potentially malicous) program placed elsewhere on the system does not get executed instead.

### Allowing access to PowerShell providers

By default, no PowerShell providers are available in JEA sessions.

This is primarily to reduce the risk of sensitive information and configuration settings being disclosed to the connecting user.

When necessary, you can allow access to the PowerShell providers using the `VisibleProviders` command.
For a full list of providers, run `Get-PSProvider`.

```powershell
VisibleProviders = 'Registry'
```

For simple tasks that require access to the file system, registry, certificate store, or other sensitive providers, you can also consider writing a custom function that works with the provider on the user's behalf.
Functions, cmdlets, and external programs that are available in a JEA session are not subject to the same constraints as JEA -- they can access any provider by default.
Also consider using the [user drive](session-configurations.md#user-drive) when copying files to/from a JEA endpoint is required.

### Creating custom functions

You can author custom functions in a role capability file to simplify complex tasks for your end users.
Custom functions are also useful when you require advanced validation logic for cmdlet parameter values.
You can write simple functions in the **FunctionDefinitions** field:

```powershell
VisibleFunctions = 'Get-TopProcess'

FunctionDefinitions = @{
    Name = 'Get-TopProcess'

    ScriptBlock = {
        param($Count = 10)

        Get-Process | Sort-Object -Property CPU -Descending | Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Select-Object -First $Count
    }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't forget to add the name of your custom functions to the **VisibleFunctions** field so they can be run by the JEA users.


The body (script block) of custom functions runs in the default language mode for the system and is not subject to JEA's language constraints.
This means that functions can access the file system and registry, and run commands that were not made visible in the role capability file.
Take care to avoid allowing arbitrary code to be run when using parameters and avoid piping user input directly into cmdlets like `Invoke-Expression`.

In the above example, you will notice that the fully qualified module name (FQMN) `Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Select-Object` was used instead of the shorthand `Select-Object`.
Functions defined in role capability files are still subject to the scope of JEA sessions, which includes the proxy functions JEA creates to constrain existing commands.

Select-Object is a default, constrained cmdlet in all JEA sessions that doesn't allow you to select arbitrary properties on objects.
To use the unconstrained Select-Object in functions, you must explicitly request the full implementation by specifying the FQMN.
Any constrained cmdlet in a JEA session will exhibit the same behavior when invoked from a function, in line with PowerShell's [command precedence](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/reference/3.0/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_command_precedence).

If you are writing a lot of custom functions, it may be easier to put them in a [PowerShell Script Module](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd878340(v=vs.85).aspx).
You can then make those functions visible in the JEA session using the VisibleFunctions field like you would with built-in and third party modules.

## Place role capabilities in a module

In order for PowerShell to find a role capability file, it must be stored in a "RoleCapabilities" folder in a PowerShell module.
The module can be stored in any folder included in the `$env:PSModulePath` environment variable, however you should not place it in System32 (reserved for built-in modules) or a folder where the untrusted, connecting users could modify the files.
Below is an example of creating a basic PowerShell script module called *ContosoJEA* in the "Program Files" path.

```powershell
# Create a folder for the module
$modulePath = Join-Path $env:ProgramFiles "WindowsPowerShell\Modules\ContosoJEA"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $modulePath

# Create an empty script module and module manifest. At least one file in the module folder must have the same name as the folder itself.
New-Item -ItemType File -Path (Join-Path $modulePath "ContosoJEAFunctions.psm1")
New-ModuleManifest -Path (Join-Path $modulePath "ContosoJEA.psd1") -RootModule "ContosoJEAFunctions.psm1"

# Create the RoleCapabilities folder and copy in the PSRC file
$rcFolder = Join-Path $modulePath "RoleCapabilities"
New-Item -ItemType Directory $rcFolder
Copy-Item -Path .\MyFirstJEARole.psrc -Destination $rcFolder
```

See [Understanding a PowerShell Module](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd878324.aspx) for more information about PowerShell modules, module manifests, and the PSModulePath environment variable.

## Updating role capabilities


You can update a role capability file at any time by simply saving changes to the role capability file.
Any new JEA sessions started after the role capability has been updated will reflect the revised capabilities.

This is why controlling access to the role capabilities folder is so important.
Only highly trusted administrators should be able to change role capability files.
If an untrusted user can change role capability files, they can easily give themselves access to cmdlets which allow them to elevate their privileges.


For administrators looking to lock down access to the role capabilities, ensure Local System has read access to the role capability files and containing modules.

## How role capabilities are merged

Users can be granted access to multiple role capabilities when they enter a JEA session depending on the role mappings in the [session configuration file](session-configurations.md).
When this happens, JEA tries to give the user the *most permissive* set of commands allowed by any of the roles.

**VisibleCmdlets and VisibleFunctions**

The most complex merge logic affects cmdlets and functions, which can have their parameters and parameter values limited in JEA.

The rules are as follows:

1. If a cmdlet is only made visible in one role, it will be visible to the user with any applicable parameter constraints.
2. If a cmdlet is made visible in more than one role, and each role has the same constraints on the cmdlet, the cmdlet will be visible to the user with those constraints.
3. If a cmdlet is made visible in more than one role, and each role allows a different set of parameters, the cmdlet and all of the parameters defined across every role will be visible to the user. If one role doesn't have constraints on the parameters, all parameters will be allowed.
4. If one role defines a validate set or validate pattern for a cmdlet parameter, and the other role allows the parameter but does not constrain the parameter values, the validate set or pattern will be ignored.
5. If a validate set is defined for the same cmdlet parameter in more than one role, all values from all validate sets will be allowed.
6. If a validate pattern is defined for the same cmdlet parameter in more than one role, any values that match any of the patterns will be allowed.
7. If a validate set is defined in one or more roles, and a validate pattern is defined in another role for the same cmdlet parameter, the validate set is ignored and rule (6) applies to the remaining validate patterns.

Below is an example of how roles are merged according to these rules:

```powershell
# Role A Visible Cmdlets
$roleA = @{
    VisibleCmdlets = 'Get-Service',
                     @{ Name = 'Restart-Service'; Parameters = @{ Name = 'DisplayName'; ValidateSet = 'DNS Client' } }
}

# Role B Visible Cmdlets
$roleB = @{
    VisibleCmdlets = @{ Name = 'Get-Service'; Parameters = @{ Name = 'DisplayName'; ValidatePattern = 'DNS.*' } },
                     @{ Name = 'Restart-Service'; Parameters = @{ Name = 'DisplayName'; ValidateSet = 'DNS Server' } }
}

# Resulting permisisons for a user who belongs to both role A and B
# - The constraint in role B for the DisplayName parameter on Get-Service is ignored becuase of rule #4
# - The ValidateSets for Restart-Service are merged because both roles use ValidateSet on the same parameter per rule #5
$mergedAandB = @{
    VisibleCmdlets = 'Get-Service',
                     @{ Name = 'Restart-Service'; Parameters = @{ Name = 'DisplayName'; ValidateSet = 'DNS Client', 'DNS Server' } }
}
```



**VisibleExternalCommands, VisibleAliases, VisibleProviders, ScriptsToProcess**

All other fields in the role capability file are simply added to a cumulative set of allowable external commands, aliases, providers, and startup scripts.
Any command, alias, provider, or script available in one role capability will be available to the JEA user.

Be careful to ensure that the combined set of providers from one role capability and cmdlets/functions/commands from another do not allow connecting users unintentional access to system resources.
For example, if one role allows the `Remove-Item` cmdlet and another allows the `FileSystem` provider, you are at risk of a JEA user deleting arbitrary files on your computer.
Additional information about identifying users' effective permissions can be found in the [auditing JEA topic](audit-and-report.md).
