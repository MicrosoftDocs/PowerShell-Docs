# The PowerShell Gallery

The PowerShell Gallery is the central repository for PowerShell content. In it, you can find useful
PowerShell modules containing PowerShell commands and Desired State Configuration (DSC) resources.
You can also find PowerShell scripts, some of which may contain PowerShell workflows, and which
outline a set of tasks and provide sequencing for those tasks. Some of these items are authored by
Microsoft, and others are authored by the PowerShell community.

## PowerShellGet Overview

The PowerShellGet module contains cmdlets for discovering, installing, updating and publishing
PowerShell artifacts such as Modules, DSC Resources, Role Capabilities and Scripts from the
[PowerShell Gallery](https://www.PowerShellGallery.com) and other private repositories.

## Getting Started with the Gallery

Installing items from the Gallery requires the latest version of the PowerShellGet module.
See [Installing PowerShellGet](installing-psget.md) for complete instructions.

Check out the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) page for more information on how to use
PowerShellGet commands with the Gallery. You can also run *Update-Help -Module PowerShellGet* to
install local help for these commands.
