## 7/13/2016 - Download Items Failed

__Summary of Impact__: Between 7/11/2016 and 7/13/2016, a subset of customers experienced issues downloading items from the PowerShell Gallery. The issue likely manifested itself in the following error message returned from Install-Module/Install-Script and Save-Module/Save-Script:

```PowerShell
