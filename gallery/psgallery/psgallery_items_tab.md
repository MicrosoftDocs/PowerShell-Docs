Items Tab
==========

The Items Tab displays all available items in the PowerShell Gallery.

To see only Modules in the PowerShell Gallery, click Modules in the Items Tab drop down.  Similarly, to see only Scripts in the PowerShell Gallery, click Scripts in the Items Tab drop down.  

To see more details about a particular item, click the item.

There are several ways to sort the items:

##Filter By##
The Filter By section allows users to filter the results by:
* Item Type:
    * Modules
    * Scripts
* Category:
    * Cmdlet
    * DSC Resource
    * Function
    * Workflow

Note: Filters are inclusive.  
Example: An item containing both Cmdlets and Functions will appear if either Cmdlet or Function (or both) are checked.  If neither are selected, the item will not appear.  
Similarly, if all categories are selected, only items containing one of those categories will appear. **Items that do not belong to any of those categories will not appear.**

##Sort By## 
The Sort By drop down allows users to sort the results by:
* Popularity - Popularity is determined by Download Count.
* A-Z - Alphabetically by item name.
* Recent - Items appear in order of publish date.


##Search Box##
The Search Box allows users to search the items on keywords.  
See [Search Syntax](./psgallery_search_syntax.md) for more details.
