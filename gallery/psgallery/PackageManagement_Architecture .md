PackageManagement (a.k.a. OneGet) is a unified interface to package management systems and aims to make Software Discovery, Installation and Inventory (SDII) work via a common set of PowerShell cmdlets. For details, visit the PackageManagement site: [OneGet.org] (https://github.com/OneGet/oneget/blob/master/readme.md)
