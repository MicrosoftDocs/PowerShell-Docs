# Community Solutions

> Applies To: Windows PowerShell 5.1

The pages in this area are intended to help make community solutions for DSC
more discoverable for new users.
Support for these solutions comes from the maintainers of these projects
and not from Microsoft
but they enrich the Microsoft supported platform and solutions.

If you would like to add a new community solution to this list
you are welcome to following the
[documentation contribution guidelines](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/CONTRIBUTING.md).
