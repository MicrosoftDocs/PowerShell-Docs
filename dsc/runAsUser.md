# Running DSC with user credentials 

> Applies To: Windows PowerShell 5.0, Windows PowerShell 5.1

You can run a DSC resource under a specified set of credentials by using the automatic **PsDscRunAsCredential** property in the configuration. 
By default, DSC runs each resource as the system account. 
There are times when running as a user is necessary, such as installing MSI packages in a specific user context, setting a user's registry keys, accessing a user's specific local directory,
or accessing a network share.

Every DSC resource has a **PsDscRunAsCredential** property that can be set to any user credentials (a [PSCredential](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms572524(v=VS.85).aspx) object).
The credential can be hard-coded as the value of the property in the configuration, or you can set the value to [Get-Credential](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849815.aspx),
which will prompt the user for a credential when the configuration is compiled (for information about compiling configurations, see [Configurations](configurations.md).

>**Note:** In PowerShell 5.0, using the **PsDscRunAsCredential** property in configurations calling composite resources was not supported. 
>In PowerShell 5.1, the **PsDscRunAsCredential** property is supported in configurations calling composite resources.

>**Note:** The **PsDscRunAsCredential** property is not available in PowerShell 4.0.

In the following example, **Get-Credential** is used to prompt the user for credentials. 
The [Registry](registryResource.md) resource is used to change the registry key that specifies the background color
for the Windows command prompt window.

```powershell
Configuration ChangeCmdBackGroundColor    
{
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration

    Node $AllNodes.NodeName
    {
        Registry CmdPath
        {
            Key                  = 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Command Processor'
            ValueName            = 'DefaultColor'
            ValueData            = '1F'
            ValueType            = 'DWORD'
            Ensure               = 'Present'
            Force                = $true
            Hex                  = $true
            PsDscRunAsCredential = Get-Credential
        }
    }                   
}

$configData = @{
    AllNodes = @(
        @{
            NodeName             = 'localhost';
            PSDscAllowDomainUser = $true
            CertificateFile      = 'C:\publicKeys\targetNode.cer'
            Thumbprint           = '7ee7f09d-4be0-41aa-a47f-96b9e3bdec25'
        }
    )
}

ChangeCmdBackGroundColor -ConfigurationData $configData
```
>**Note:** This example assumes that you have a valid certificate at `C:\publicKeys\targetNode.cer`, and that the thumbprint of that certificate is the value shown.
