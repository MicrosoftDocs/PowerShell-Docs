- **New features:**
  - After GitHub's recent move to TLS 1.2, you can't onboard a VM to Azure Automation DSC using DIY Resource Manager templates available on Azure Marketplace or use DSC extension to get any config hosted on GitHub. You will see an error similar to the following while deploying the extension:

    ```json
    {
        "code": "DeploymentFailed",
        "message": "At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list deployment operations for details. Please see https://aka.ms/arm-debug for usage details.",
        "details": [{
            "code": "Conflict",
            "message": "{
                \"status\": \"Failed\",
                \"error\": {
                    \"code\": \"ResourceDeploymentFailure\",
                    \"message\": \"The resource operation completed with terminal provisioning state 'Failed'.\",
                    \"details\": [ {
                        \"code\": \"VMExtensionProvisioningError\",
                        \"message\": \"VM has reported a failure when processing extension 'Microsoft.Powershell.DSC'.
                        Error message: \\\"The DSC Extension failed to execute: Error downloading
                        https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/raw/master/dsc-extension-azure-automation-pullserver/UpdateLCMforAAPull.zip
                        after 29 attempts: The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel..\\nMore information about the failure can
                        be found in the logs located under 'C:\\\\WindowsAzure\\\\Logs\\\\Plugins\\\\Microsoft.Powershell.DSC\\\\2.74.0.0' on the VM.\\\".\"
                    } ]
                }
            }"
        }]
    }
    ```

  - In the new extension version, TLS 1.2 is now enforced. While deploying the extension if you already had the AutoUpgradeMinorVersion = true in the Resource Manager template, then the extension will get autoupgraded to 2.75.

  - Retry logic on errors that occur during the DSC Extension install or while applying a DSC configuration post extension install. As a part of this change, the extension will retry the installation if a previous install failed or re-enact a DSC configuration that had previously failed, for a maximum three times until it reaches the completion state (Success/Error) or if a new request comes. If the extension fails due to invalid user settings/user input, it does not retry. In this case, the extension needs to be invoked again with a new request and correct user settings. Note: The DSC Extension is dependent on the Azure VM agent for the retries. Azure VM agent invokes the extension with the last failed request until it reaches a success or error state.
