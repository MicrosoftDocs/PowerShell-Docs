# Credentials Options in Configuration Data
>Applies To: Windows PowerShell 5.0

## Plain Text Passwords and Domain Users

DSC configurations containing a credential without encryption
will generate an error message about plain text passwords.
Also, DSC will generate a warning when using domain credentials.
To suppress these error and warning messages use the DSC configuration data keywords:
* **PsDscAllowPlainTextPassword**
* **PsDscAllowDomainUser**

> [!NOTE]
> Storing/transmitting plaintext passwords unencrypted is generally not secure. Securing credentials by using the techniques covered later in this topic is recommended.
> The Azure Automation DSC service allows you to centrally manage credentials to be compiled in configurations and stored securely.
> For information, see: [Compiling DSC Configurations / Credential Assets](/azure/automation/automation-dsc-compile#credential-assets)

The following is an example of passing plain text credentials:

```powershell
#Prompt user for their credentials
#credentials will be unencrypted in the MOF
$promptedCreds = get-credential -Message "Please enter your credentials to generate a DSC MOF:"

# Store passwords in plaintext, in the document itself
# will also be stored in plaintext in the mof
$password = "ThisIsAPlaintextPassword" | ConvertTo-SecureString -asPlainText -Force
$username = "User1"
[PSCredential] $credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($username,$password)

# DSC requires explicit confirmation before storing passwords insecurely
$ConfigurationData = @{
    AllNodes = @(
        @{
            # The "*" means "all nodes named in ConfigData" so we don't have to repeat ourselves
            NodeName="*"
            PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword = $true
        },
        #however, each node still needs to be explicitly defined for "*" to have meaning
        @{
            NodeName = "TestMachine1"
        },
        #we can also use a property to define node-specific passwords, although this is no more secure
        @{
            NodeName = "TestMachine2";
            UserName = "User2"
            LocalPassword = "ThisIsYetAnotherPlaintextPassword"
        }
        )
}
configuration unencryptedPasswordDemo
{
    Node "TestMachine1"
    {
        # We use the plaintext password to generate a new account
        User User1
        {
            UserName = $username
            Password = $credential
            Description = "local account"
            Ensure = "Present"
            Disabled = $false
            PasswordNeverExpires = $true
            PasswordChangeRequired = $false
        }
        # We use the prompted password to add this account to the local admins group
        Group addToAdmin
        {
            # Ensure the user exists before we add the user to a group
            DependsOn = "[User]User1"
            Credential = $promptedCreds
            GroupName = "Administrators"
            Ensure = "Present"
            MembersToInclude = "User1"
        }
    }

    Node "TestMachine2"
    {
        # Now we'll use a node-specific password to this machine
        $password = $Node.LocalPass | ConvertTo-SecureString -asPlainText -Force
        $username = $node.UserName
        [PSCredential] $nodeCred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($username,$password)

        User User2
        {
            UserName = $username
            Password = $nodeCred
            Description = "local account"
            Ensure = "Present"
            Disabled = $false
            PasswordNeverExpires = $true
            PasswordChangeRequired = $false
        }

        Group addToAdmin
        {
            Credential = $domain
            GroupName = "Administrators"
            DependsOn = "[User]User2"
            Ensure = "Present"
            MembersToInclude = "User2"
        }
    }

}
# We declared the ConfigurationData in a local variable, but we need to pass it in to our configuration function
# We need to invoke the configuration function we created to generate a MOF
unencryptedPasswordDemo -ConfigurationData $ConfigurationData
# We need to pass the MOF to the machines we named.
#-wait: doesn't use jobs so we get blocked at the prompt until the configuration is done
#-verbose: so we can see what's going on and catch any errors
#-force: for testing purposes, I run start-dscconfiguration frequently + want to make sure i'm
#        not blocked by previous configurations that are still running
Start-DscConfiguration ./unencryptedPasswordDemo -verbose -wait -force
```

## Handling Credentials in DSC

DSC configuration resources run as `Local System` by default.
However, some resources need a credential,
for example when the `Package` resource needs to install software under a specific user account.

Earlier resources used a hard-coded `Credential` property name to handle this.
WMF 5.0 added an automatic `PsDscRunAsCredential` property for all resources.
For information about using `PsDscRunAsCredential`,
see [Running DSC with user credentials](runAsUser.md).
Newer resources and custom resources can use this automatic property
instead of creating their own property for credentials.

> [!NOTE]
> The design of some resources are to use multiple credentials for a specific reason, and they will have their own credential properties.

To find the available credential properties on a resource
use either `Get-DscResource -Name ResourceName -Syntax`
or the Intellisense in the ISE (`CTRL+SPACE`).

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DscResource -Name Group -Syntax
Group [String] #ResourceName
{
    GroupName = [string]
    [Credential = [PSCredential]]
    [DependsOn = [string[]]]
    [Description = [string]]
    [Ensure = [string]{ Absent | Present }]
    [Members = [string[]]]
    [MembersToExclude = [string[]]]
    [MembersToInclude = [string[]]]
    [PsDscRunAsCredential = [PSCredential]]
}
```

This example uses a [Group](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/dsc/groupresource) resource
from the `PSDesiredStateConfiguration` built-in DSC resource module.
It can create local groups and add or remove members.
It accepts both the `Credential` property and the automatic `PsDscRunAsCredential` property.
However, the resource only uses the `Credential` property.

For more information about the `PsDscRunAsCredential` property,
see [Running DSC with user credentials](runAsUser.md).

## Example: The Group resource Credential property

DSC runs under `Local System`, so it already has permissions to change local users and groups.
If the member added is a local account, then no credential is necessary.
If the `Group` resource adds a domain account to the local group, then a credential is necessary.

Anonymous queries to Active Directory are not allowed.
The `Credential` property of the `Group` resource is the domain account
used to query Active Directory.
For most purposes this could be a generic user account,
because by default users can *read* most of the objects in Active Directory.

## Example Configuration

The following example code uses DSC to populate a local group with a domain user:

```powershell
Configuration DomainCredentialExample
{
    param
    (
        [PSCredential] $DomainCredential
    )
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration

    node localhost
    {
        Group DomainUserToLocalGroup
        {
            GroupName        = 'ApplicationAdmins'
            MembersToInclude = 'contoso\alice'
            Credential       = $DomainCredential
        }
    }
}

$cred = Get-Credential -UserName contoso\genericuser -Message "Password please"
DomainCredentialExample -DomainCredential $cred
```

This code generates both an error and warning message:

```
ConvertTo-MOFInstance : System.InvalidOperationException error processing
property 'Credential' OF TYPE 'Group': Converting and storing encrypted
passwords as plain text is not recommended. For more information on securing
credentials in MOF file, please refer to MSDN blog:

WARNING: It is not recommended to use domain credential for node 'localhost'.
In order to suppress the warning, you can add a property named
'PSDscAllowDomainUser' with a value of $true to your DSC configuration data
for node 'localhost'.
```

This example has two issues:
1. An error explains that plain text passwords are not recommended
2. A warning advises against using a domain credential

## PsDscAllowPlainTextPassword

The first error message has a URL with documentation.
This link explains how to encrypt passwords
using a [ConfigurationData](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/dsc/configdata)
structure and a certificate.
For more information on certificates and DSC [read this post](http://aka.ms/certs4dsc).

To force a plain text password,
the resource requires the `PsDscAllowPlainTextPassword` keyword in the configuration data section
as follows:

```powershell
Configuration DomainCredentialExample
{
    param
    (
        [PSCredential] $DomainCredential
    )
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration

    node localhost
    {
        Group DomainUserToLocalGroup
        {
            GroupName        = 'ApplicationAdmins'
            MembersToInclude = 'contoso\alice'
            Credential       = $DomainCredential
        }
    }
}

$cd = @{
    AllNodes = @(
        @{
            NodeName = 'localhost'
            PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword = $true
        }
    )
}

$cred = Get-Credential -UserName contoso\genericuser -Message "Password please"
DomainCredentialExample -DomainCredential $cred -ConfigurationData $cd
```

> [!NOTE]
> `NodeName` cannot equal asterisk, a specific node name is mandatory.

**Microsoft advises to avoid plain text passwords due to the significant security risk.**

## Domain Credentials

Running the example configuration script again (with or without encryption),
still generates the warning that using a domain account for a credential is not recommended.
Using a local account eliminates potential exposure of domain credentials
that could be used on other servers.

**When using credentials with DSC resources, prefer a local account over a domain account when possible.**

If there is a '\' or '@' in the `Username` property of the credential,
then DSC will treat it as a domain account.
There is an exception for "localhost",
"127.0.0.1", and "::1" in the domain portion of the user name.

## PSDscAllowDomainUser

In the DSC `Group` resource example above,
querying an Active Directory domain *requires* a domain account.
In this case add the `PSDscAllowDomainUser` property to the `ConfigurationData` block as follows:

```powershell
$cd = @{
    AllNodes = @(
        @{
            NodeName = 'localhost'
            PSDscAllowDomainUser = $true
            # PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword = $true
            CertificateFile = "C:\PublicKeys\server1.cer"
        }
    )
}
```

Now the configuration script will generate the MOF file with no errors or warnings.
