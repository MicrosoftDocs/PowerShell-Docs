A DSC [SMB](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831795(v=ws.11)) pull server is a computer hosting SMB file shares that make DSC configuration files and DSC resources
available to target nodes when those nodes ask for them.

To use an SMB pull server for DSC, you have to:

- Set up an SMB file share on a server running PowerShell 4.0 or higher
- Configure a client running PowerShell 4.0 or higher to pull from that SMB share

## Using the xSmbShare resource to create an SMB file share

There are a number of ways to set up an SMB file share, but let's look at how you can do this by using DSC.

### Install the xSmbShare resource

Call the [Install-Module](/powershell/module/PowershellGet/Install-Module) cmdlet to install the **xSmbShare** module.

> [!NOTE]
> `Install-Module` is included in the **PowerShellGet** module, which is included in PowerShell 5.0. You can download the **PowerShellGet** module for PowerShell 3.0 and 4.0 at [PackageManagement PowerShell Modules Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49186).
> The **xSmbShare** contains the DSC resource **xSmbShare**, which can be used to create an SMB file share.

### Create the directory and file share

The following configuration uses the [File](fileResource.md) resource to create the directory for the share and the **xSmbShare** resource to set up the SMB share:

```powershell
Configuration SmbShare
{
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName xSmbShare

    Node localhost
    {

        File CreateFolder
        {
            DestinationPath = 'C:\DscSmbShare'
            Type = 'Directory'
            Ensure = 'Present'
        }

        xSMBShare CreateShare
        {
            Name = 'DscSmbShare'
            Path = 'C:\DscSmbShare'
            FullAccess = 'admininstrator'
            ReadAccess = 'myDomain\Contoso-Server$'
            FolderEnumerationMode = 'AccessBased'
            Ensure = 'Present'
            DependsOn = '[File]CreateFolder'
        }
    }
}
```

The configuration creates the directory `C:\DscSmbShare` if it doesn't already exists, and then uses that directory as an SMB file share. **FullAccess** should be given to any
account that needs to write to or delete from the file share, and **ReadAccess** must be given to any client nodes that get configurations and/or DSC resources from the share (
this is because DSC runs as the system account by default, so the computer itself has to have access to the share).

### Give file system access to the pull client

Giving **ReadAccess** to a client node allows that node to access the SMB share, but not to files or folders within that share. You have to explicitly grant client nodes access to the SMB share
folder and sub-folders. We can do this with DSC by adding using the **cNtfsPermissionEntry** resource, which is contained in the [CNtfsAccessControl](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/cNtfsAccessControl/1.2.0)
module. The following configuration adds a **cNtfsPermissionEntry** block that grants ReadAndExecute access to the pull client:

```powershell
Configuration DSCSMB
{
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName xSmbShare
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName cNtfsAccessControl

    Node localhost
    {

        File CreateFolder
        {
            DestinationPath = 'DscSmbShare'
            Type = 'Directory'
            Ensure = 'Present'
        }

        xSMBShare CreateShare
        {
            Name = 'DscSmbShare'
            Path = 'DscSmbShare'
            FullAccess = 'administrator'
            ReadAccess = 'myDomain\Contoso-Server$'
            FolderEnumerationMode = 'AccessBased'
            Ensure = 'Present'
            DependsOn = '[File]CreateFolder'
        }

        cNtfsPermissionEntry PermissionSet1
        {
            Ensure = 'Present'
            Path = 'C:\DSCSMB'
            Principal = 'myDomain\Contoso-Server$'
            AccessControlInformation = @(
                cNtfsAccessControlInformation
                {
                    AccessControlType = 'Allow'
                    FileSystemRights = 'ReadAndExecute'
                    Inheritance = 'ThisFolderSubfoldersAndFiles'
                    NoPropagateInherit = $false
                }
            )
            DependsOn = '[File]CreateFolder'
        }
    }
}
```

## Placing configurations and resources

Save any configuration MOF files and/or DSC resources that you want client nodes to pull in the SMB share folder.

Any configuration MOF file must be named *ConfigurationID*.mof, where *ConfigurationID* is the value of the **ConfigurationID** property of the target node's LCM. For more information about
setting up pull clients, see [Setting up a pull client using configuration ID](pullClientConfigID.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You must use configuration IDs if you are using an SMB pull server. Configuration names are not supported for SMB.

Each resource module needs to be zipped and named according the following pattern `{Module Name}_{Module Version}.zip`. For example, a module named xWebAdminstration with a module version
of 3.1.2.0 would be named 'xWebAdministration_3.2.1.0.zip'. Each version of a module must be contained in a single zip file. Since there is only a single version of a resource in each zip
file the module format added in WMF 5.0 with support for multiple module versions in a single directory is not supported. This means that before packaging up DSC resource modules for use with
pull server you need to make a small change to the directory structure. The default format of modules containing DSC resource in WMF 5.0 is
`{Module Folder}\{Module Version}\DscResources\{DSC Resource Folder}\`. Before packaging up for the pull server simply remove the `{Module version}` folder so the path becomes
`{Module Folder}\DscResources\{DSC Resource Folder}\`. With this change, zip the folder as described above and place these zip files in the SMB share folder.

## Creating the MOF checksum

A configuration MOF file needs to be paired with a checksum file so that an LCM on a target node can validate the configuration.
To create a checksum, call the [New-DSCCheckSum](/powershell/module/PSDesiredStateConfiguration/New-DSCCheckSum) cmdlet. The cmdlet takes a `Path` parameter that specifies the folder
where the configuration MOF is located. The cmdlet creates a checksum file named `ConfigurationMOFName.mof.checksum`, where `ConfigurationMOFName` is the name of the configuration mof file.
If there are more than one configuration MOF files in the specified folder, a checksum is created for each configuration in the folder.

The checksum file must be present in the same directory as the configuration MOF file (`$env:PROGRAMFILES\WindowsPowerShell\DscService\Configuration` by default), and have the same name with the `.checksum` extension appended.

> [!NOTE]
> If you change the configuration MOF file in any way, you must also recreate the checksum file.

## Setting up a pull client for SMB

To set up a client that pulls configurations and/or resources from an SMB share, you configure the client's Local Configuration Manager (LCM) with **ConfigurationRepositoryShare** and
**ResourceRepositoryShare** blocks that specify the share from which to pull configurations and DSC resources.

For more information about configuring the LCM, see [Setting up a pull client using configuration ID](pullClientConfigID.md).

> [!NOTE]
> For simplicity, this example uses the **PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword** to allow passing a plaintext password to the **Credential** parameter. For information
> about passing credentials more securely, see [Credentials Options in Configuration Data](configDataCredentials.md).
>
> You **MUST** specify a **ConfigurationID** in the **Settings** block of a metaconfiguration for an SMB pull server, even if you are only pulling resources.

```powershell
$secpasswd = ConvertTo-SecureString “Pass1Word” -AsPlainText -Force
$mycreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential (“TestUser”, $secpasswd)

[DSCLocalConfigurationManager()]
configuration SmbCredTest
{
    Node $AllNodes.NodeName
    {
        Settings
        {
            RefreshMode = 'Pull'
            RefreshFrequencyMins = 30
            RebootNodeIfNeeded = $true
            ConfigurationID    = '16db7357-9083-4806-a80c-ebbaf4acd6c1'
        }

         ConfigurationRepositoryShare SmbConfigShare
        {
            SourcePath = '\\WIN-E0TRU6U11B1\DscSmbShare'
            Credential = $mycreds
        }

        ResourceRepositoryShare SmbResourceShare
        {
            SourcePath = '\\WIN-E0TRU6U11B1\DscSmbShare'
            Credential = $mycreds

        }
    }
}

$ConfigurationData = @{
    AllNodes = @(
        @{
            #the "*" means "all nodes named in ConfigData" so we don't have to repeat ourselves
            NodeName="localhost"
            PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword = $true
        })
}
```
