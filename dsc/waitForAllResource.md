# DSC WaitForAll Resource

> Applies To: Windows PowerShell 5.0 and later

The **WaitForAll** Desired State Configuration (DSC) resource can be used within a node block in a [DSC configuration](configurations.md)
to specify dependencies on configurations on other nodes.

This resource succeeds if the resource specified by the **ResourceName** property is in the desired state on all target nodes defined in the **NodeName** property.


## Syntax

```
WaitForAll [string] #ResourceName
{
    ResourceName = [string]
    NodeName = [string]
    [ RetryIntervalSec = [Uint64] ]
    [ RetryCount = [Uint32] ]
    [ ThrottleLimit = [Uint32]]
    [ DependsOn = [string[]] ]
}
```

## Properties

|  Property  |  Description   |
|---|---|
| ResourceName| The resource name to depend on. If this resource belongs to a different configuration, format the name as "[__ResourceType__]__ResourceName__::[__ConfigurationName__]::[__ConfigurationName__]"|
| NodeName| The target nodes of the resource to depend on.|
| RetryIntervalSec| The number of seconds before retrying. Minimum is 1.|
| RetryCount| The maximum number of times to retry.|
| ThrottleLimit| Number of machines to connect simultaneously. Default is new-cimsession default.|
| DependsOn | Indicates that the configuration of another resource must run before this resource is configured. For example, if the ID of the resource configuration script block that you want to run first is __ResourceName__ and its type is __ResourceType__, the syntax for using this property is `DependsOn = "[ResourceType]ResourceName"`.|
