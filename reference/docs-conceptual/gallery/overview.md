# The PowerShell Gallery

The [PowerShell Gallery][02] is the central repository for PowerShell content. In it, you can find
PowerShell scripts, modules containing PowerShell cmdlets and Desired State Configuration (DSC)
resources. Some of these packages are authored by Microsoft, and others are authored by the
PowerShell community.

The **PowerShellGet** module contains cmdlets for discovering, installing, updating, and publishing
PowerShell packages from the PowerShell Gallery. These packages can contain artifacts such as
Modules, DSC Resources, Role Capabilities, and Scripts. Make sure you have the latest version of
**PowerShellGet** installed.

The documentation for **PowerShellGet** and the PowerShell Gallery has been moved to a new location
so that we can manage the version-specific information separate from the versions of PowerShell.

See the new documentation in [PowerShellGet and the PowerShell Gallery][01].
