# The PowerShell Gallery

The PowerShell Gallery is the central repository for PowerShell content. In it, you can find
PowerShell scripts, modules containing PowerShell cmdlets and Desired State Configuration (DSC)
resources. Some of these packages are authored by Microsoft, and others are authored by the
PowerShell community.

## The PowerShellGet module

The **PowerShellGet** module contains cmdlets for discovering, installing, updating, and publishing
PowerShell packages from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com). These packages
can contain artifacts such as Modules, DSC Resources, Role Capabilities, and Scripts.

### Version history

> of the PowerShell Gallery. To be supported, you must update to the latest version.

2.2.3 of **PowerShellGet**. The current supported version of **PowerShellGet** is 2.2.5.

## Getting Started with the PowerShell Gallery

Check out the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) page for more information on how to use
**PowerShellGet** commands with the Gallery. You can also run
`Update-Help -Module PowerShellGet -Force` to install local help for these commands.

PowerShell is cross-platform, which means it works on Windows, Linux, and macOS. That also makes
**PowerShellGet** available on those systems. For a full list of systems supported by PowerShell
see [Installing PowerShell](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell).

Modules in the PowerShell Gallery can support different operating systems and have additional
requirements. For information, see the documentation for the module.
