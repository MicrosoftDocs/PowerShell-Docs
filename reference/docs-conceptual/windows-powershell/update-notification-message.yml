          The `aka.ms` takes you to this page. If you want to install the latest version of
          PowerShell, follow the instructions in

      - question: But I installed PowerShell 7, why am I still seeing this message?

          You always get the message when you run Windows PowerShell 5.1. PowerShell 7 doesn't
          replace Windows PowerShell 5.1. It installs side-by-side. You can run either version.
