# Improvements in PowerShell Script Debugging

PowerShell 5.0 includes several improvements that enhance the debugging experience.

## Break All

The PowerShell console and PowerShell ISE now allow you to break into the debugger for running
scripts. This works in both local and remote sessions.

In the console, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Break</kbd>.

In ISE, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>, or use the **Debug -> Break All** menu command.

## Remote debugging and remote file editing in PowerShell ISE

PowerShell ISE now lets you open and edit files in a remote session by running the PSEdit command.
For example, you can open a file for editing from the command line in a remote session as follows:

```powershell
[RemoteComputer1]: PS C:\> PSEdit C:\DebugDemoScripts\Test-GetMutex.ps1
```

In addition, you can now edit and save changes in a remote file that is automatically opened in
PowerShell ISE when you hit a breakpoint. Now, you can debug a script file that is running on a
remote computer, edit the file to fix an error, and then rerun the modified script.

## Advanced Script Debugging

There are new, advanced debugging features that let you attach to any local computer process that
has loaded PowerShell, and debug arbitrary runspaces in that process.

### Runspace Debugging

New cmdlets have been added that let you list current runspaces in a process, and attach the
PowerShell console or PowerShell ISE debugger to that runspace for script debugging:

- Get-Runspace
- Debug-Runspace
- Enable-RunspaceDebug
- Disable-RunspaceDebug
- Get-RunspaceDebug

### Attach to Process hosting PowerShell

You can now attach to any computer process that has PowerShell loaded. You do this by entering into
an interactive session with the host process. For more information, see:

- [Enter-PSHostProcess](/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/Enter-PSHostProcess)
- [Exit-PSHostProcess](/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/Exit-PSHostProcess)
