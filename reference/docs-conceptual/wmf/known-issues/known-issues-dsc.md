# Desired State Configuration (DSC) Known Issues and Limitations

## Breaking Change: Certificates used to encrypt/decrypt passwords in DSC configurations may not work after installing WMF 5.0 RTM

In WMF 4.0 and WMF 5.0 Preview releases, DSC would not allow passwords in the configuration to be of
length more than 121 characters. DSC was forcing to use short passwords even if lengthy and strong
password was desired. This breaking change allows passwords to be of arbitrary length in the DSC
configuration.

**Resolution:** Re-create the certificate with Data Encipherment or Key Encipherment Key usage, and
Document Encryption Enhanced Key usage (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.80.1). For more information, see [Protect-CmsMessage](/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Security/Protect-CmsMessage).

## DSC cmdlets may fail after installing WMF 5.0 RTM

`Start-DscConfiguration` and other DSC cmdlets may fail after installing WMF 5.0 RTM with the
following error:

```Output
LCM failed to retrieve the property PendingJobStep from the object of class dscInternalCache .
+ CategoryInfo : ObjectNotFound: (root/Microsoft/...gurationManager:String) [], CimException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : MI RESULT 6
+ PSComputerName : localhost
```

**Resolution:** Delete DSCEngineCache.mof by running the following command in an elevated PowerShell
session (Run as Administrator):

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path $env:SystemRoot\system32\Configuration\DSCEngineCache.mof
```

## DSC cmdlets may not work if WMF 5.0 RTM is installed on top of WMF 5.0 Production Preview

**Resolution:** Run the following command in an elevated PowerShell session (run as administrator):

```powershell
mofcomp $env:windir\system32\wbem\DscCoreConfProv.mof
```

## LCM can go into an unstable state while using Get-DscConfiguration in DebugMode

If LCM is in DebugMode, pressing CTRL+C to stop the processing of `Get-DscConfiguration` can cause
LCM to go into an unstable state such that majority of DSC cmdlets won’t work.

**Resolution:** Don’t press CTRL+C while debugging `Get-DscConfiguration` cmdlet.

## Stop-DscConfiguration may not respond in DebugMode

If LCM is in DebugMode, `Stop-DscConfiguration` may not respond while trying to stop an operation
started by `Get-DscConfiguration`

**Resolution:** Finish the debugging of the operation started by `Get-DscConfiguration` as outlined
in [Debugging DSC resources](/powershell/dsc/troubleshooting/debugResource).

## No Verbose Error Messages are shown in DebugMode

If LCM is in **DebugMode**, no verbose error messages are displayed from DSC Resources.

**Resolution:** Disable **DebugMode** to see verbose messages from the resource

## Invoke-DscResource operations cannot be retrieved by Get-DscConfigurationStatus cmdlet

After using `Invoke-DscResource` cmdlet to directly invoke any resource’s methods, the records of
such operation cannot be retrieved through `Get-DscConfigurationStatus`.

**Resolution:** None.

## Get-DscConfigurationStatus returns pull cycle operations as type **Consistency**

When a node is set to PULL refresh mode, for each pull operation performed,
`Get-DscConfigurationStatus` cmdlet reports the operation type as **Consistency** instead of *Initial*

**Resolution:** None.

## Invoke-DscResource cmdlet does not return message in the order they were produced

The `Invoke-DscResource` cmdlet does not return verbose, warning, and error messages in the order
they were produced by LCM or the DSC resource.

**Resolution:** None.

## DSC Resources cannot be debugged easily when used with Invoke-DscResource

When LCM is running in debug mode, `Invoke-DscResource` cmdlet does not give information about
runspace to connect to for debugging. For more information, see [Debugging DSC resources](/powershell/dsc/troubleshooting/debugResource).

**Resolution:** Discover and attach to the runspace using cmdlets `Get-PSHostProcessInfo`,
`Enter-PSHostProcess` , `Get-Runspace` and `Debug-Runspace` to debug the DSC resource.

```powershell
# Find all the processes hosting PowerShell
Get-PSHostProcessInfo

ProcessName    ProcessId AppDomainName
-----------    --------- -------------
powershell          3932 DefaultAppDomain
powershell_ise      2304 DefaultAppDomain
WmiPrvSE            3396 DscPsPluginWkr_AppDomain

# Enter the process that is hosting DSC engine (WMI process with DscPsPluginWkr_Appdomain)
Enter-PSHostProcess -Id 3396 -AppDomainName DscPsPluginWkr_AppDomain

# Find all the available rusnspaces in that process
Get-Runspace

Id Name       ComputerName Type  State  Availability
-- ----       ------------ ----  -----  ------------
 2 Runspace2  localhost    Local Opened InBreakpoint
 5 RemoteHost localhost    Local Opened Busy

# Debug the runspace that is in **InBreakpoint** availability state
Debug-Runspace -Id 2
```

## Various Partial Configuration documents for same node cannot have identical resource names

For several partial configurations that are deployed onto a single node, identical names of
resources cause run time error.

**Resolution:** Use different names for even same resources in different partial configurations.

## Start-DscConfiguration –UseExisting does not work with -Credential

When using `Start-DscConfiguration` with **UseExisting** parameter, the **Credential** parameter is
ignored. DSC uses default process identity to proceed the operation. This causes error when a
different credential is needed to proceed on remote node.

**Resolution:** Use CIM session for remote DSC operations:

```powershell
$session = New-CimSession -ComputerName $node -Credential $credential
Start-DscConfiguration -UseExisting -CimSession $session
```

## IPv6 Addresses as Node Names in DSC configurations

IPv6 addresses as node names in DSC configuration scripts are not supported in this release.

**Resolution:** None.

## Debugging of `Class-Based` DSC Resources

Debugging of class-based DSC Resources is not supported in this release.

**Resolution:** None.

## Variables and functions defined in $script scope in DSC Class-Based Resource are not preserved across multiple calls to a DSC Resource

Multiple consecutive calls to `Start-DSCConfiguration` fails if the configuration is using any
class-based resource which has variables or functions defined in `$script` scope.

**Resolution:** Define all variables and functions in DSC Resource class itself. No `$script` scope
variables/functions.

## DSC Resource Debugging when a resource is using PSDscRunAsCredential

DSC Resource debugging when a resource is using the **PSDscRunAsCredential** property in the
configuration is not supported in this release.

**Resolution:** None.

## PsDscRunAsCredential is not supported for DSC Composite Resources

**Resolution:** Use Credential property if available. Example ServiceSet and WindowsFeatureSet

## Get-DscResource -Syntax does not reflect PsDscRunAsCredential correctly

The **Syntax** parameter does not reflect **PsDscRunAsCredential** correctly when resource marks it
as mandatory or does not support it.

**Resolution:** None. However, authoring configuration in ISE reflects correct metadata about
**PsDscRunAsCredential** property when using IntelliSense.

## WindowsOptionalFeature is not available in Windows 7

The **WindowsOptionalFeature** DSC resource is not available in Windows 7. This resource requires
the DISM module, and DISM cmdlets that are available starting in Windows 8 and newer releases of the
Windows operating system.

## For Class-based DSC resources, Import-DscResource -ModuleVersion may not work as expected

If the compilation node has multiple versions of a class-based DSC resource module,
`Import-DscResource -ModuleVersion` does not pick the specified version and results in following
compilation error.

```Output
ImportClassResourcesFromModule : Exception calling "ImportClassResourcesFromModule" with "3" argument(s):
 "Keyword 'MyTestResource' already defined in the configuration."
At C:\Windows\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\PSDesiredStateConfiguration\PSDesiredStateConfiguration.psm1:2035 char:35
+ ... rcesFound = ImportClassResourcesFromModule -Module $mod -Resources $r ...
+                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [ImportClassResourcesFromModule], MethodInvocationException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : PSInvalidOperationException,ImportClassResourcesFromModule
```

**Resolution:** Import the required version by defining the **ModuleSpecification** object to the
**ModuleName** parameter with **RequiredVersion** key specified as follows:

```powershell
Import-DscResource -ModuleName @{ModuleName='MyModuleName';RequiredVersion='1.2'}
```

## Some DSC resources like registry resource may start to take a long time to process the request.

**Resolution 1:** Create a schedule task that cleans up the following folder periodically.

```powershell
$env:windir\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\CommandAnalysis
```

**Resolution 2:** Change the DSC configuration to clean up the *CommandAnalysis* folder at the end
of the configuration.

```powershell
Configuration $configName
{

   # User Data
    Registry SetRegisteredOwner
    {
        Ensure = 'Present'
        Force = $True
        Key = $Node.RegisteredKey
        ValueName = $Node.RegisteredOwnerValue
        ValueType = 'String'
        ValueData = $Node.RegisteredOwnerData
    }
    #
    # Script to delete the config
    #
    script DeleteCommandAnalysisCache
    {
        DependsOn = "[Registry]SetRegisteredOwner"
        getscript = "@{}"
        testscript = 'Remove-Item -Path $env:windir\system32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\CommandAnalysis -Force -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -ErrorVariable ev | out-null;$true'
        setscript = '$true'
    }
}
```
