# PowerShell Engine Improvements

The following improvements to the core PowerShell engine have been implemented in WMF 5.1:

## Performance

Performance has improved in some important areas:

- Startup
- Pipelining to cmdlets like `ForEach-Object` and `Where-Object` is approximately 50% faster

Some example improvements (your results may vary depending on your hardware):

| Scenario | 5.0 Time (ms) | 5.1 Time (ms) |
| -------- | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| `powershell -command "echo 1"` | 900 | 250 |
| First ever PowerShell run: `powershell -command "Unknown-Command"` | 30000 | 13000 |
| Command analysis cache built: `powershell -command "Unknown-Command"` | 7000 | 520 |
| <code>1..1000000 &#124; % { }</code> | 1400 | 750 |

> [!NOTE]
> One change related to startup might impact some unsupported scenarios. PowerShell no longer reads
> the files `$pshome\*.ps1xml` -- these files have been converted to C# to avoid some file and CPU
> overhead of processing the XML files. The files still exist to support V2 side-by-side, so if you
> change the file contents, it will not have any effect to V5, only V2. Note that changing the
> contents of these files was never a supported scenario.

Another visible change is how PowerShell caches the exported commands and other information for
modules that are installed on a system. Previously, this cache was stored in the directory
`$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\CommandAnalysis`. In WMF 5.1, the cache is a single
file `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ModuleAnalysisCache`. See [Module Analysis Cache](release-notes.md#module-analysis-cache)
for more details.
