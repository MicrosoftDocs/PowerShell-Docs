# Installing various versions of PowerShell

Over the years, there have been many releases of PowerShell. Initially, Windows PowerShell was built
on the .NET Framework and only worked on Windows systems. With the current release, PowerShell uses
.NET Core 3.1 as its runtime. PowerShell runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

## PowerShell

PowerShell Core is an Open Source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/powershell/powershell). See
