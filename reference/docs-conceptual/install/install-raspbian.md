# Installing PowerShell on Raspberry Pi OS

All packages are available on our GitHub [releases][releases] page. After the package is installed,
run `pwsh` from a terminal. Run `pwsh-preview` if you installed a preview release.

> [!NOTE]
> PowerShell 7.2 is an in-place upgrade that removes previous versions of PowerShell.
>
> If you need to run PowerShell 7.2 side-by-side with a previous version, reinstall the previous
> version using the [binary archive](install-other-linux.md#binary-archives) method.

## Raspberry Pi OS

[Raspberry Pi OS][raspbian] (formerly Raspbian) is a free operating system based on Debian.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> .NET is not supported on ARMv6 architecture devices, including Raspberry Pi Zero and Raspberry Pi
> devices prior to Raspberry Pi 2.

### Install on Raspberry Pi OS

Download the tar.gz package from the [releases][releases] page onto your openSUSE computer. The
links to the current versions are:

- PowerShell 7.2-preview.9 - `https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.2.0-preview.9/powershell-7.2.0-preview.9-linux-arm32.tar.gz`
- PowerShell 7.1.4 - `https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.1.4/powershell-7.1.4-linux-arm32.tar.gz`
- PowerShell 7.0.7 - `https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.0.7/powershell-7.0.7-linux-arm32.tar.gz`

Use the following shell commands to download and install the package. Change the URL to match the
PowerShell version that you want to install.

```sh
###################################
# Prerequisites

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update

# Install libunwind8 and libssl1.0
# Regex is used to ensure that we do not install libssl1.0-dev, as it is a variant that is not required
sudo apt-get install '^libssl1.0.[0-9]$' libunwind8 -y

###################################
# Download and extract PowerShell

# Grab the latest tar.gz
wget https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.1.4/powershell-7.1.4-linux-arm32.tar.gz

# Make folder to put powershell
mkdir ~/powershell

# Unpack the tar.gz file
tar -xvf ./powershell-7.1.4-linux-arm32.tar.gz -C ~/powershell

# Start PowerShell
~/powershell/pwsh
```

Optionally, you can create a symbolic link to start PowerShell without specifying the path to the
`pwsh` binary.

```sh
# Start PowerShell from bash with sudo to create a symbolic link
sudo ~/powershell/pwsh -command 'New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "/usr/bin/pwsh" -Target "$PSHOME/pwsh" -Force'

# alternatively you can run following to create a symbolic link
# sudo ln -s ~/powershell/pwsh /usr/bin/pwsh

# Now to start PowerShell you can just run "pwsh"
```

### Uninstallation - Raspbian

```sh
rm -rf ~/powershell
```

## PowerShell paths

- `$PSHOME` is `/opt/microsoft/powershell/7/`
- User profiles are read from `~/.config/powershell/profile.ps1`
- Default profiles are read from `$PSHOME/profile.ps1`
- User modules are read from `~/.local/share/powershell/Modules`
- Shared modules are read from `/usr/local/share/powershell/Modules`
- Default modules are read from `$PSHOME/Modules`
- PSReadLine history is recorded to `~/.local/share/powershell/PSReadLine/ConsoleHost_history.txt`

The profiles respect PowerShell's per-host configuration, so the default host-specific profiles
exists at `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` in the same locations.

PowerShell respects the [XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg-bds] on Linux.

## Installation support

Microsoft supports the installation methods in this document. There may be other methods of
installation available from other third-party sources. While those tools and methods may work,
Microsoft cannot support those methods.
