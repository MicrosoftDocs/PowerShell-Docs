# Installing PowerShell on macOS

PowerShell 7 or higher requires macOS 11 and higher. All packages are available on our GitHub
[releases][09] page. After the package is installed, run `pwsh` from a terminal. Before installing,
check the list of [Supported versions][06] below.

> [!NOTE]
> PowerShell 7.4 is an in-place upgrade that removes previous versions of PowerShell 7. Preview
> versions of PowerShell can be installed side-by-side with other versions of PowerShell. If you
> need to run PowerShell 7.4 side-by-side with a previous version, reinstall the previous version
> using the [binary archive][04] method.

## Install the latest stable release of PowerShell

There are several ways to install PowerShell on macOS. Choose one of the following methods:

- Install using [Homebrew][10]. Homebrew is the preferred package manager for macOS.
- Install PowerShell via [Direct Download][04]
- Install from [binary archives][03].

If the `brew` command isn't found, you need to install Homebrew following [their instructions][10].

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once `brew` is installed you can install PowerShell.

The following command installs the latest stable release of PowerShell:

```sh
brew install powershell/tap/powershell
```

Finally, verify that your install is working properly:

```sh
pwsh
```

When new versions of PowerShell are released, update Homebrew's formulae and upgrade PowerShell:

```sh
brew update
brew upgrade powershell
```

> [!NOTE]
> The commands above can be called from within a PowerShell (pwsh) host, but then the PowerShell
> shell must be exited and restarted to complete the upgrade and refresh the values shown in
> `$PSVersionTable`.

[brew]: https://brew.sh/

## Install the latest preview release of PowerShell

After you've installed Homebrew, you can install PowerShell.

```sh
brew install powershell/tap/powershell-preview
```

Run the following command to start the preview version of PowerShell:

```sh
pwsh-preview
```

When new versions of PowerShell are released, update Homebrew's formulae and upgrade PowerShell:

```sh
brew update
brew upgrade powershell-preview
```

> [!NOTE]
> The commands above can be called from within a PowerShell (pwsh) host, but then the PowerShell
> shell must be exited and restarted to complete the upgrade. and refresh the values shown in
> `$PSVersionTable`.

## Install the latest LTS release of PowerShell

```sh
brew install powershell/tap/powershell-lts
```

You can now verify your install

```sh
pwsh
```

When new versions of PowerShell are released, run the following command.

```sh
brew upgrade powershell-lts
```

> [!NOTE]
> Whether you use the cask or the tap method, when updating to a newer version of PowerShell, use
> the same method you used to initially install PowerShell. If you use a different method, opening a
> new pwsh session will continue to use the older version of PowerShell.
>
> If you do decide to use different methods, there are ways to correct the issue using the
> [Homebrew link method][11].

## Installation via Direct Download

Starting with version 7.2, PowerShell supports the Apple M-series Arm-based processors. Download the
install package from the [releases][09] page onto your computer. The links to the current versions
are:

- PowerShell 7.4
  - x64 processors - [powershell-7.4.6-osx-x64.pkg][20]
  - Arm64 processors - [powershell-7.4.6-osx-arm64.pkg][18]
- PowerShell 7.2 (LTS)
  - x64 processors - [powershell-7.2.24-osx-x64.pkg][16]
  - Arm64 processors - [powershell-7.2.24-osx-arm64.pkg][14]
- PowerShell 7.5-preview
  - x64 processors - [powershell-7.5.0-preview.3-osx-x64.pkg][24]
  - Arm64 processors - [powershell-7.5.0-preview.3-arm64.pkg][22]

You can double-click the file and follow the prompts, or install it from the terminal using the
following commands. Change the name of the file to match the file you downloaded.

```sh
sudo installer -pkg ./Downloads/powershell-7.4.6-osx-x64.pkg -target /
```

If you are running on macOS Big Sur 11.5 or higher you may receive the following error message
when installing the package:

> "powershell-7.4.6-osx-x64.pkg" cannot be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious
> software.

There are two ways to work around this issue:

Using the Finder

1. Find the package in Finder.
1. Control-click (click while pressing the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key) on the package.
1. Select **Open** from the context menu.

From the command line

1. Run `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ./Downloads/powershell-7.4.6-osx-x64.pkg`. If you are using
   PowerShell 7 or higher, you can use the `Unblock-File` cmdlet. Include the full path to the
   `.pkg` file.
1. Install the package as you normally would.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a known issue related to package notarization that will be addressed in the future.

## Install as a .NET Global tool

If you already have the [.NET Core SDK][01] installed, it's easy to install PowerShell as a
[.NET Global tool][02].

```
dotnet tool install --global PowerShell
```

The dotnet tool installer adds `~/.dotnet/tools` to your `PATH` environment variable. However, the
currently running shell doesn't have the updated `PATH`. You should be able to start PowerShell from
a new shell by typing `pwsh`.

## Binary Archives

PowerShell binary `tar.gz` archives are provided for the macOS platform to enable advanced
deployment scenarios. When you install using this method you must also manually install any
dependencies.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use this method to install any version of PowerShell including the latest:
>
> - Stable release: [https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=stable][09]
> - LTS release: [https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=lts][07]
> - Preview release: [https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=preview][08]

### Installing binary archives on macOS

Download the install package from the [releases][09] page onto your computer. The links to the
current versions are:

- PowerShell 7.4 (LTS)
  - x64 processors - [powershell-7.4.6-osx-x64.tar.gz][21]
  - Arm64 processors - [powershell-7.4.6-osx-arm64.tar.gz][19]
- PowerShell 7.2 (LTS)
  - x64 processors - [powershell-7.2.24-osx-x64.tar.gz][17]
  - Arm64 processors - [powershell-7.2.24-osx-arm64.tar.gz][15]
- PowerShell 7.5-preview
  - x64 processors - [powershell-7.5.0-preview.3-osx-x64.tar.gz][25]
  - Arm64 processors - [powershell-7.5.0-preview.3-osx-arm64.tar.gz][23]

Use the following commands to install PowerShell from the binary archive. Change the download URL to
match the version you want to install.

```sh
# Download the powershell '.tar.gz' archive
curl -L -o /tmp/powershell.tar.gz https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.4.6/powershell-7.4.6-osx-x64.tar.gz

# Create the target folder where powershell is placed
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7

# Expand powershell to the target folder
sudo tar zxf /tmp/powershell.tar.gz -C /usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7

# Set execute permissions
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh

# Create the symbolic link that points to pwsh
sudo ln -s /usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh /usr/local/bin/pwsh
```

## Uninstalling PowerShell

If you installed PowerShell with Homebrew, use the following command to uninstall:

```sh
brew uninstall --cask powershell
```

If you installed PowerShell via direct download, PowerShell must be removed manually:

```sh
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/pwsh /usr/local/microsoft/powershell
```

To remove the additional PowerShell paths, refer to the [paths][05] section in this document and
remove the paths using `sudo rm`.

> [!NOTE]
> This isn't necessary if you installed with Homebrew.

## Paths

- `$PSHOME` is `/usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7`
  - The macOS install package creates a symbolic link, `/usr/local/bin/pwsh` that points to `pwsh`
    in the `$PSHOME` location.
- User profiles are read from `~/.config/powershell/profile.ps1`
- Default profiles are read from `$PSHOME/profile.ps1`
- User modules are read from `~/.local/share/powershell/Modules`
- Shared modules are read from `/usr/local/share/powershell/Modules`
- Default modules are read from `$PSHOME/Modules`
- PSReadLine history are recorded to `~/.local/share/powershell/PSReadLine/ConsoleHost_history.txt`

PowerShell respects the [XDG Base Directory Specification][26] on macOS.
