# Installing PowerShell on macOS

PowerShell 7 or higher requires macOS 13 and higher. All packages are available on the GitHub
[releases][09] page for PowerShell. After the package is installed, run `pwsh` from a terminal.
Before installing, check the list of [Supported versions][06].

> [!NOTE]
> PowerShell 7.4 is an in-place upgrade that removes previous versions of PowerShell 7. You can
> install preview versions of PowerShell side-by-side with other versions of PowerShell. If you need
> to run PowerShell 7.4 side-by-side with a previous version, reinstall the previous version using
> the [binary archive][04] method.

[!INCLUDE [Latest version](../../includes/latest-install.md)]

## Install the latest stable release of PowerShell

There are several ways to install PowerShell on macOS. Choose one of the following methods:

- Install using [Homebrew][27]. Homebrew is the preferred package manager for macOS.
- Install via [Direct Download][04].
- Install as [a .NET Global tool][28].
- Install from [binary archives][03].

## Install using Homebrew

If the `brew` command isn't found, you need to install Homebrew following [their instructions][10].

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once `brew` is installed, install PowerShell.

The following command installs the latest stable release of PowerShell:

```sh
brew install --cask powershell
```

Verify the installation is working correctly:

```sh
pwsh
```

When new versions of PowerShell are released, update Homebrew's formulae and upgrade PowerShell:

```sh
brew update
brew upgrade powershell
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can call the previous commands from within a PowerShell (`pwsh`) session, but then you must
> restart the PowerShell session to complete the upgrade and refresh the values shown in
> `$PSVersionTable`.

[brew]: https://brew.sh/

### Install the latest preview release of PowerShell

The following command installs the latest preview release of PowerShell:

```sh
brew install powershell/tap/powershell-preview
```

Run the following command to start the preview version of PowerShell:

```sh
pwsh-preview
```

When new preview versions of PowerShell are released, update Homebrew's formulae and upgrade to the
latest preview version of PowerShell:

```sh
brew update
brew upgrade powershell-preview
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can call the previous commands from within a PowerShell (`pwsh`) session, but then you must
> restart the PowerShell session to complete the upgrade and refresh the values shown in
> `$PSVersionTable`.

### Install the latest LTS release of PowerShell

The following command installs the latest LTS release of PowerShell:

```sh
brew install powershell/tap/powershell-lts
```

Verify your installation:

```sh
pwsh-lts
```

When new LTS versions of PowerShell are released, run the following commands to update Homebrew's
formulae and upgrade to the latest LTS version of PowerShell:

```sh
brew update
brew upgrade powershell-lts
```

> [!NOTE]
> When updating to a newer version of PowerShell, use the same method, cask or the tap, that you
> used to perform the initial install. If you use a different method, opening a new pwsh session
> continues to use the older version of PowerShell.
>
> If you decide to use different methods, there are ways to correct the issue using the
> [Homebrew link method][11].

## Installation via Direct Download

Starting with version 7.2, PowerShell supports the Apple M-series Arm-based processors. Download the
install package from the [releases][09] page onto your Mac. The links to the current versions are:

- PowerShell 7.5
  - Arm64 processors - [powershell-7.5.2-arm64.pkg][22]
  - x64 processors - [powershell-7.5.2-osx-x64.pkg][24]

- PowerShell 7.4
  - Arm64 processors - [powershell-7.4.11-osx-arm64.pkg][18]
  - x64 processors - [powershell-7.4.11-osx-x64.pkg][20]

There are two ways to install PowerShell using the Direct Download method.

### Using Finder

Install PowerShell using Finder:

1. Open Finder
1. Locate the downloaded package
1. Double-click the file
1. Follow the prompts

You might receive the following error message when installing the package:

> "powershell-7.5.2-osx-arm64.pkg" cannot be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious
> software.

To work around this issue using Finder:

1. Locate the downloaded package in Finder
1. Control-click (click while pressing the <kbd>Control (or Ctrl)</kbd> key on the package
1. Select **Open** from the context menu

### Using Terminal

Install PowerShell from the terminal. Change the filename to match the package you downloaded.

```sh
sudo installer -pkg ./Downloads/powershell-7.5.2-osx-arm64.pkg -target /
```

You might receive the following error message when installing the package:

> "powershell-7.5.2-osx-arm64.pkg" cannot be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious
> software.

There are a few different ways to work around this issue from the command line:

- Run the `installer` command with the **allowUntrusted** flag:

  ```sh
  `sudo installer -allowUntrusted -pkg ./Downloads/powershell-7.5.2-osx-arm64.pkg -target /`
  ```

- Or install the package as you normally would after running one of the following commands:

  - Run `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ./Downloads/powershell-7.5.2-osx-arm64.pkg`.
  - Use the `Unblock-File` cmdlet if you're using PowerShell. Include the full path to the `.pkg`
    file.

## Install as a .NET Global tool

If you already have the [.NET Core SDK][01] installed, it's easy to install PowerShell as a
[.NET Global tool][02].

```sh
dotnet tool install --global PowerShell
```

The dotnet tool installer adds `~/.dotnet/tools` to your `PATH` environment variable. However, the
currently running shell doesn't have the updated `PATH`. Start PowerShell from a new shell by typing
`pwsh`.

## Binary archives

PowerShell binary `tar.gz` archives are provided for the macOS platform to enable advanced
deployment scenarios. When you install using this method, you must also manually install any
dependencies.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use this method to install any version of PowerShell including the latest:
>
> - Stable release: [https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=stable][09]
> - LTS release: [https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=lts][07]
> - Preview release: [https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=preview][08]

### Installing binary archives on macOS

Download the install package from the [releases][09] page onto your Mac. The links to the current
versions are:

- PowerShell 7.5-preview
  - Arm64 processors - [powershell-7.5.2-osx-arm64.tar.gz][23]
  - x64 processors - [powershell-7.5.2-osx-x64.tar.gz][25]

- PowerShell 7.4 (LTS)
  - Arm64 processors - [powershell-7.4.11-osx-arm64.tar.gz][19]
  - x64 processors - [powershell-7.4.11-osx-x64.tar.gz][21]

Use the following commands to install PowerShell from the binary archive. Change the download URL to
match the version you want to install.

```sh
# Download the powershell '.tar.gz' archive
curl -L -o /tmp/powershell.tar.gz https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.5.2/powershell-7.5.2-osx-arm64.tar.gz

# Create the target folder where powershell is placed
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7

# Expand powershell to the target folder
sudo tar zxf /tmp/powershell.tar.gz -C /usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7

# Set execute permissions
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh

# Create the symbolic link that points to pwsh
sudo ln -s /usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh /usr/local/bin/pwsh
```

## Uninstalling PowerShell

If you installed PowerShell with Homebrew, use the following command to uninstall:

```sh
brew uninstall --cask powershell
```

If you installed PowerShell via direct download, PowerShell must be removed manually:

```sh
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/pwsh /usr/local/microsoft/powershell
```

To remove the extra PowerShell paths, refer to the [paths][05] section in this document and remove
the paths using `sudo rm`.

> [!NOTE]
> This process isn't necessary if you installed with Homebrew.

## Paths

- `$PSHOME` is `/usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7`
  - The macOS install package creates a symbolic link, `/usr/local/bin/pwsh` that points to `pwsh`
    in the `$PSHOME` location.
- User profiles are read from `~/.config/powershell/profile.ps1`
- Default profiles are read from `$PSHOME/profile.ps1`
- User modules are read from `~/.local/share/powershell/Modules`
- Shared modules are read from `/usr/local/share/powershell/Modules`
- Default modules are read from `$PSHOME/Modules`
- PSReadLine history is recorded to `~/.local/share/powershell/PSReadLine/ConsoleHost_history.txt`

PowerShell respects the [XDG Base Directory Specification][26] on macOS.
