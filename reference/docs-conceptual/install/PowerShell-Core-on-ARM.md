Today, PowerShell Core works on some ARM devices, including Windows 10 ARM32/ARM64 and Raspbian.
PowerShell Core for ARM is an experimental release that is unsupported.

For more information on installing these experimental builds, see the installation instructions for
[Windows 10 IoT](installing-powershell-core-on-windows.md#deploying-on-windows-iot)
and [Raspbian](installing-powershell-core-on-linux.md#raspbian).

More information will be available here as our ARM64 story progresses.

Stay tuned!
