# Installing PowerShell on macOS

PowerShell supports macOS 10.12 and higher. PowerShell 7.0.3 or higher and PowerShell Preview
7.1.0 or higher require macOS 10.13 and higher. All packages are available on our GitHub [releases][]
page. After the package is installed, run `pwsh` from a terminal.

> [!NOTE]
> PowerShell 7 is an in-place upgrade that removes PowerShell Core 6.x.
>
> The `/usr/local/microsoft/powershell/6` folder is replaced by `/usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7`.
>
> If you need to run PowerShell 6 side-by-side with PowerShell 7, reinstall PowerShell 6 using the
> [binary archive](#binary-archives) method.

There are several ways to install PowerShell on macOS. Choose one of the following methods:

- Install using Homebrew. Homebrew is the preferred package manager for macOS.
- Install PowerShell via [Direct Download](#installation-via-direct-download)
- Install from [binary archives](#binary-archives).

After installing PowerShell, you should install [OpenSSL](#installing-dependencies). OpenSSL is
needed for PowerShell remoting and CIM operations.

## Installation of latest stable release via Homebrew on macOS 10.13 or higher

If the `brew` command is not found, you need to install Homebrew following
[their instructions][brew].

Now, you can install PowerShell:

```sh
brew cask install powershell
```

Finally, verify that your install is working properly:

```sh
pwsh
```

When new versions of PowerShell are released, update Homebrew's formulae and upgrade PowerShell:

```sh
brew update
brew upgrade powershell --cask
```

> [!NOTE]
> The commands above can be called from within a PowerShell (pwsh) host,
> but then the PowerShell shell must be exited and restarted to complete the upgrade
> and refresh the values shown in `$PSVersionTable`.

## Installation of latest preview release via Homebrew on macOS 10.13 or higher

After you've installed Homebrew, you can install PowerShell. First, install the [Cask-Versions][cask-versions]
package that lets you install alternative versions of cask packages:

```sh
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
```

Now, you can install PowerShell:

```sh
brew cask install powershell-preview
```

Finally, verify that your install is working properly:

```sh
pwsh-preview
```

When new versions of PowerShell are released, update Homebrew's formulae and upgrade PowerShell:

```sh
brew update
brew upgrade powershell-preview --cask
```

> [!NOTE]
> The commands above can be called from within a PowerShell (pwsh) host,
> but then the PowerShell shell must be exited and restarted to complete the upgrade.
> and refresh the values shown in `$PSVersionTable`.

Installing PowerShell using the Homebrew tap method is also supported for stable and LTS versions.

```sh
brew install powershell/tap/powershell
```

You can now verify your install

```sh
pwsh
```

When new versions of PowerShell are released, simply run the following command.

```sh
brew upgrade powershell
```

> [!NOTE]
> Whether you use the cask or the tap method, when updating to a newer version of PowerShell, use
> the same method you used to initially install PowerShell. If you use a different method, opening a
> new pwsh session will continue to use the older version of PowerShell.
>
> If you do decide to use different methods, there are ways to correct the issue using the
> [Homebrew link method](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage#link-ln-options-formula).

## Installation via Direct Download

Download the PKG package `powershell-lts-7.0.3-osx-x64.pkg` from the [releases][] page onto your
macOS machine.

You can double-click the file and follow the prompts, or install it from the terminal:

```sh
sudo installer -pkg powershell-lts-7.0.3-osx-x64.pkg -target /
```

Install [OpenSSL](#installing-dependencies). OpenSSL is needed for PowerShell remoting and CIM
operations.

## Install as a .NET Global tool

If you already have the [.NET Core SDK](/dotnet/core/sdk) installed, it's easy to install PowerShell
as a [.NET Global tool](/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools).

```
dotnet tool install --global PowerShell
```

The dotnet tool installer adds `~/.dotnet/tools` to your `PATH` environment variable. However, the
currently running shell does not have the updated `PATH`. You should be able to start PowerShell
from a new shell by typing `pwsh`.

Install [OpenSSL](#installing-dependencies). OpenSSL is needed for PowerShell remoting and CIM
operations.

## Binary Archives

PowerShell binary `tar.gz` archives are provided for the macOS platform to enable advanced
deployment scenarios. When you install using this method you must also manually install any
dependencies.

Install [OpenSSL](#installing-dependencies). OpenSSL is needed for PowerShell remoting and CIM
operations.

### Installing binary archives on macOS

```sh
# Download the powershell '.tar.gz' archive
curl -L -o /tmp/powershell.tar.gz https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.0.3/powershell-7.0.3-osx-x64.tar.gz

# Create the target folder where powershell will be placed
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7.0.3

# Expand powershell to the target folder
sudo tar zxf /tmp/powershell.tar.gz -C /usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7.0.3

# Set execute permissions
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7.0.3/pwsh

# Create the symbolic link that points to pwsh
sudo ln -s /usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7.0.3/pwsh /usr/local/bin/pwsh
```

## Installing dependencies

OpenSSL is required for PowerShell remoting and CIM operations. You can install OpenSSL via MacPorts
if needed.

> [!NOTE]
> MacPorts and Homebrew can have problems when used to together on the same system. However,
> Homebrew does not have a package for OpenSSL 1.0. For more information, see the
> [MacPorts FAQ](https://trac.macports.org/wiki/FAQ).

1. Install the Xcode command-line tools. The Xcode tools are required by MacPorts.

   ```sh
   xcode-select --install
   ```

1. Install MacPorts. If you need instructions, refer to the
   [installation guide](https://www.macports.org/install.php).
1. Update MacPorts by running `sudo port selfupdate`.
1. Upgrade MacPorts packages by running `sudo port upgrade outdated`.
1. Install OpenSSL by running `sudo port install openssl10`.
1. Link the libraries to make them available to PowerShell:

   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/opt/openssl
   sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib/openssl-1.0 /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib
   ```

## Uninstalling PowerShell

If you installed PowerShell with Homebrew, use the following command to uninstall:

```sh
brew cask uninstall powershell
```

If you installed PowerShell via direct download, PowerShell must be removed manually:

```sh
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/pwsh /usr/local/microsoft/powershell
```

To remove the additional PowerShell paths, refer to the [paths](#paths) section in this document
and remove the paths using `sudo rm`.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not necessary if you installed with Homebrew.

## Paths

- `$PSHOME` is `/usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7.0.3/`
- User profiles will be read from `~/.config/powershell/profile.ps1`
- Default profiles will be read from `$PSHOME/profile.ps1`
- User modules will be read from `~/.local/share/powershell/Modules`
- Shared modules will be read from `/usr/local/share/powershell/Modules`
- Default modules will be read from `$PSHOME/Modules`
- PSReadline history will be recorded to `~/.local/share/powershell/PSReadLine/ConsoleHost_history.txt`

The profiles respect PowerShell's per-host configuration. So the default host-specific profile
exists at `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` in the same locations.

PowerShell respects the [XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg-bds] on macOS.

Because macOS is a derivation of BSD, the prefix `/usr/local` is used instead of `/opt`. So,
`$PSHOME` is `/usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7.0.3/`, and the symbolic link is placed at
`/usr/local/bin/pwsh`.

## Installation support

Microsoft supports the installation methods in this document. There may be other methods of
installation available from other sources. While those tools and methods may work, Microsoft cannot
support those methods.
