# Installing PowerShell on Debian

All packages are available on our GitHub [releases][02] page. Before installing, check the list of
[Supported versions][01] below. After the package is installed, run `pwsh` from a terminal. Run
`pwsh-lts` if you installed a preview release.

> [!NOTE]
> PowerShell 7.4 is an in-place upgrade that removes previous versions of PowerShell 7. Preview
> versions of PowerShell can be installed side-by-side with other versions of PowerShell. If you
> need to run PowerShell 7.4 side-by-side with a previous version, reinstall the previous version
> using the [binary archive][05] method.

Debian uses APT (Advanced Package Tool) as a package manager.

## Installation on Debian 10 or 11 via the Package Repository

Microsoft builds and supports a variety of software products for Linux systems and makes them
available via Linux packaging clients (apt, dnf, yum, etc). These Linux software packages are hosted
on the _Linux package repository for Microsoft products_, [https://packages.microsoft.com][03], also
known as _PMC_.

Installing PowerShell from PMC is the preferred method of installation.

> [!NOTE]
