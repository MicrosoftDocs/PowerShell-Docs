# PowerShell on Arm processors

Support for the Arm processor is based on the support policy of the version of .NET that PowerShell
uses. While .NET supports many more operating systems and versions, PowerShell support is limited to
the versions that have been tested.

It may be possible to use Arm-based versions of PowerShell on other Linux distributions and
versions, but we don't officially support it.

## PowerShell 7.4

Arm versions of PowerShell 7.4 can be installed on the following platforms:

|                OS                | Architectures |               Lifecycle                |
