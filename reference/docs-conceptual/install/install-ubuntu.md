# Installing PowerShell on Ubuntu

All packages are available on our GitHub [releases][05] page. Before installing,
check the list of [Supported versions][04] below. After the package is installed, run
`pwsh` from a terminal. Run `pwsh-lts` if you installed a preview release.

> [!NOTE]
> PowerShell 7.4 is an in-place upgrade that removes previous versions of PowerShell 7. Preview
> versions of PowerShell can be installed side-by-side with other versions of PowerShell. If you
> need to run PowerShell 7.4 side-by-side with a previous version, reinstall the previous version
> using the [binary archive][08] method.

Ubuntu uses APT (Advanced Package Tool) as a package manager.

## Installation via Package Repository the Package Repository

Microsoft builds and supports a variety of software products for Linux systems and makes them
available via Linux packaging clients (apt, dnf, yum, etc). These Linux software packages are hosted
on the _Linux package repository for Microsoft products_, [https://packages.microsoft.com][06], also
known as _PMC_.

Installing PowerShell from PMC is the preferred method of installation.

> [!NOTE]
> This script only works for supported versions of Ubuntu.

# Prerequisites

# Update the list of packages
sudo apt-get update

# Install pre-requisite packages.
sudo apt-get install -y wget apt-transport-https software-properties-common

# Get the version of Ubuntu
source /etc/os-release

# Download the Microsoft repository keys
wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/$VERSION_ID/packages-microsoft-prod.deb

# Register the Microsoft repository keys
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb

# Delete the Microsoft repository keys file
rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ubuntu comes preconfigured with a package repository that includes .NET packages, but not
> PowerShell. Using these instructions to install PowerShell registers the Microsoft repository as a
> package source. You can install PowerShell and some versions of .NET from this repository.
> However, the Ubuntu package repository has different versions of the .NET packages. This can cause
> problems when installing .NET for other purposes. For more information about these problems, see
> [Troubleshoot .NET package mix ups on Linux][02].
>
> You must choose the feed you want to use to install .NET. You can set the priority of the package
> repositories to favor one over the other. For instructions on how to set the priorities, see
> [My Linux distribution provides .NET packages, and I want to use them][01].
