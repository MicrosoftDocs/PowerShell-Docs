# Install PowerShell on Linux

PowerShell can be installed on different Linux distributions. Most Linux platforms and distributions
have a major release each year, and most provide a package manager that is used to install
PowerShell. This article describes what is currently supported and which package manager is used.

The rest of this article is a breakdown of each Linux distribution that PowerShell supports. All
PowerShell releases remain supported until either the version of
[PowerShell reaches end-of-support][lifecycle] or the Linux distribution reaches end-of-life.

For the best compatibility, choose a long-term release (LTS) version.

## Community supported distributions

There are many distributions of Linux that are not officially supported by Microsoft. In some cases,
PowerShell may be supported by the community for these releases. For more information, see
[Community support for PowerShell on Linux][community].

## Alternate installation methods

There are three other ways to install PowerShell on Linux, including Linux distributions that aren't officially supported. You can try to install PowerShell using
the PowerShell Snap Package. You can also try deploying PowerShell binaries directly using the Linux
`tar.gz`. For more information, see [Alternate ways to install PowerShell on Linux][other-linux].
