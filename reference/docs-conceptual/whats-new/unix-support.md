# PowerShell differences on non-Windows platforms

PowerShell strives to provide feature parity across all supported platforms. However, some features
behave differently or aren't available due to differences in .NET Core and platform-specific
differences. Other changes were made to improve the interoperability of PowerShell on non-Windows
platforms.

## .NET Framework vs .NET Core

PowerShell on Linux and macOS uses .NET Core, a subset of the full .NET Framework on Microsoft
Windows. As a result, scripts that run on Windows might not run on non-Windows platforms because of
the differences in the frameworks.

For more information about changes in .NET Core, see
[Breaking changes for migration from .NET Framework to .NET Core][01].

## General Unix interoperability changes

- Added support for native command globbing on Unix platforms. This means you can use wildcards with
  native commands like `ls *.txt`.
- The `more` functionality respects the Linux `$PAGER` and defaults to `less`.
- Trailing backslash is automatically escaped when dealing with native command arguments.
- Fixed ConsoleHost to honor `NoEcho` on Unix platforms.
- Don't add `PATHEXT` environment variable on Unix.
- A `powershell` man-page is included in the package.

## Execution policy

PowerShell ignores execution policies when running on non-Windows platforms. `Get-ExecutionPolicy`
returns **Unrestricted** on Linux and macOS. `Set-ExecutionPolicy` does nothing on Linux and macOS.

## Case-sensitivity in PowerShell

Historically, PowerShell has been uniformly case-insensitive, with few exceptions. On UNIX-like
operating systems, the file system is predominantly case-sensitive, and PowerShell adheres to the
standard of the file system.

- You must use the correct case when a filename in specified in PowerShell.
- If a script tries to load a module and the module name isn't cased correctly, then the module load
  fails. This behavior might cause a problem with existing scripts if the name referenced by the
  module doesn't match the proper case of the actual filename.
- While names in the filesystem are case-sensitive, tab-completion of filenames isn't
  case-sensitive. Tab-completion cycles through the list of names using case-insensitive matching.
- `Get-Help` supports case-insensitive pattern matching on Unix platforms.
- `Import-Module`Â is case insensitive when used with a filename to determine the module name.

## Filesystem support for Linux and macOS

- Paths given to cmdlets are now slash-agnostic (both `/` and `\` work as directory separators)
- XDG Base Directory Specification is now respected and used by default:
  - The Linux/macOS profile path is located at `~/.config/powershell/profile.ps1`
  - The history save path is located at `~/.local/share/powershell/PSReadline/ConsoleHost_history.txt`
  - The user module path is located at `~/.local/share/powershell/Modules`
- Support for file and folder names containing the colon character on Unix.
- Support for script names or full paths that have commas.
- Detect when the **LiteralPath** parameter is used to suppress wildcard expansion for navigation
  cmdlets.
- Updated `Get-ChildItem` to work more like the *nix `ls -R` and the Windows `DIR /S` native
  commands. `Get-ChildItem` now returns the symbolic links encountered during a recursive search and
  doesn't search the directories that those links target.

## .PS1 File Extensions

PowerShell scripts must end in `.ps1` for the interpreter to understand how to load and run them in
the current process. Running scripts in the current process is the expected usual behavior for
PowerShell. You can add the `#!` magic number to a script that doesn't have a `.ps1` extension, but
this causes the script to be run in a new PowerShell instance, preventing the script from working
correctly when interchanging objects. This behavior might be desirable when executing a PowerShell
script from Bash or another shell.

## Convenience aliases removed

PowerShell provides a set of aliases on Windows that map to Linux command names for user
convenience. On Linux and macOS, the "convenience aliases" for the basic commands `ls`, `cp`, `mv`,
`rm`, `cat`, `man`, `mount`, and `ps` were removed to allow the native executable to run without
specifying a path.

## Logging

On macOS, PowerShell uses the native `os_log` APIs to log to Apple's [unified logging system][08].
On Linux, PowerShell uses [Syslog][09], a ubiquitous logging solution.

## Job Control

There's no Unix-style job-control support in PowerShell on Linux or macOS. The `fg` and `bg`
commands aren't available. However, you can use [PowerShell jobs][02] that work on all platforms.

Putting `&` at the end of a pipeline causes the pipeline to be run as a PowerShell job. When a
pipeline is backgrounded, a job object is returned. Once the pipeline is running as a job, all
`*-Job` cmdlets can be used to manage the job. Variables (ignoring process-specific variables) used
in the pipeline are automatically copied to the job so `Copy-Item $foo $bar &` just works. The job
runs in the current directory instead of the user's home directory.

## Remoting Support

PowerShell Remoting (PSRP) using WinRM on Unix platforms requires NTLM/Negotiate or Basic Auth over
HTTPS. PSRP on macOS only supports Basic Auth over HTTPS. Kerberos-based authentication isn't
supported.

PowerShell supports PowerShell Remoting (PSRP) over SSH on all platforms (Windows, Linux, and
macOS). For more information, see [SSH remoting in PowerShell][04].

## Just-Enough-Administration (JEA) Support

PowerShell on Linux or macOS doesn't allow you to create constrained administration (JEA) remoting
endpoints.

## `sudo`, `exec`, and PowerShell

Because PowerShell runs most commands in memory (like Python or Ruby), you can't use `sudo` directly
with PowerShell built-ins. You can run `pwsh` from `sudo`. If it's necessary to run a PowerShell
cmdlet from within PowerShell with `sudo`, for example, `sudo Set-Date 8/18/2016`, then you would
use `sudo pwsh Set-Date 8/18/2016`.

## Modules included on non-Windows platforms

For non-Windows platforms, PowerShell includes the following modules:

- Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive
- Microsoft.PowerShell.Core
- Microsoft.PowerShell.Host
- Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
- Microsoft.PowerShell.Security
- Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
- PackageManagement
- PowerShellGet
- PSReadLine
- ThreadJob

A large number of the commands (cmdlets) commonly available in PowerShell aren't available on Linux
or macOS. Often, these commands don't apply to these platforms. For example, commands for
Windows-specific features like the registry or services aren't available. Other commands, like
`Set-ExecutionPolicy`, are present but not functional.

For a comprehensive list of modules and cmdlets and the platforms they support, see
[Release history of modules and cmdlets][05].

## Modules no longer shipped with PowerShell

For various compatibility reasons, the following modules are no longer included in PowerShell.

- ISE
- Microsoft.PowerShell.LocalAccounts
- Microsoft.PowerShell.ODataUtils
- Microsoft.PowerShell.Operation.Validation
- PSScheduledJob
- PSWorkflow
- PSWorkflowUtility

The following Windows-specific modules aren't included in PowerShell for Linux or macOS.

- CimCmdlets
- Microsoft.PowerShell.Diagnostics
- Microsoft.WSMan.Management
- PSDiagnostics

## Cmdlets not available on non-Windows platforms

Some cmdlets were removed from PowerShell. Others aren't available or might work differently on
non-Windows platforms. For a comprehensive list of cmdlets removed from PowerShell, see
[Cmdlets removed from PowerShell][06].

## Aliases not available on Linux or macOS

The following table lists the aliases available for Windows that aren't available on non-Windows
platforms. These aliases aren't available because the alias conflicts with a native command on those
platforms.

| --------- | ---------------------- |
| `ac`      | `Add-Content`          |
| `cat`     | `Get-Content`          |
| `clear`   | `Clear-Host`           |
| `compare` | `Compare-Object`       |
| `cp`      | `Copy-Item`            |
| `cpp`     | `Copy-ItemProperty`    |
| `diff`    | `Compare-Object`       |

| `tee`     | `Tee-Object`           |
| `write`   | `Write-Output`         |

The table doesn't include aliases unavailable for cmdlets that don't exist on non-Windows platforms.

## PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC)

Beginning with PowerShell 7.2, the **PSDesiredStateConfiguration** module was removed from
PowerShell and is published in the PowerShell Gallery. For more information, see the
[announcement][07] on the PowerShell Team blog. For more information about using DSC on Linux, see
[Get started with DSC for Linux][03]. DSC v1.1 and v2.x aren't supported on macOS. DSC v3 is
supported on Windows, Linux, and macOS, but it's still in early development.
