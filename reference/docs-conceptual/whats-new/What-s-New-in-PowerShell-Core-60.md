# What's New in PowerShell Core 6.0

[PowerShell Core 6.0][github] is a new edition of PowerShell that is cross-platform (Windows, macOS, and Linux), open-source, and built for heterogeneous environments and the hybrid cloud.

## Moved from .NET Framework to .NET Core

PowerShell Core uses [.NET Core 2.0][] as its runtime.
.NET Core 2.0 enables PowerShell Core to work on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux).
PowerShell Core also exposes the API set offered by .NET Core 2.0 to be used in PowerShell cmdlets and scripts.

Windows PowerShell used the .NET Framework runtime to host the PowerShell engine.
This means that Windows PowerShell exposes the API set offered by .NET Framework.

The APIs shared between .NET Core and .NET Framework are defined as part of [.NET Standard][].

For more information on how this affects module/script compatibility between PowerShell Core and Windows PowerShell,
see [Backwards compatibility with Windows PowerShell](#backwards-compatibility-with-windows-powershell).

## Support for macOS and Linux

PowerShell now officially supports macOS and Linux, including:

- Windows 7, 8.1, and 10
- Windows Server 2008 R2, 2012 R2, 2016
- [Windows Server Semi-Annual Channel][semi-annual]
- Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, and 17.04
- Debian 8.7+, and 9
- CentOS 7
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
- OpenSUSE 42.2
- Fedora 25, 26
- macOS 10.12+

Our community has also contributed packages for the following platforms,
but they are not officially supported:

- Arch Linux
- Kali Linux
- AppImage (works on multiple Linux platforms)

We also have experimental (unsupported) releases for the following platforms:

- Windows on ARM32/ARM64
- Raspbian (Stretch)

A number of changes were made to in PowerShell Core 6.0 to make it work better on non-Windows systems.
Some of these are breaking changes, which also affect Windows.
Others are only present or applicable in non-Windows installations of PowerShell Core.

- Added support for native command globbing on Unix platforms.
- The `more` functionality respects the Linux `$PAGER` and defaults to `less`.
  This means you can now use wildcards with native binaries/commands (for example, `ls *.txt`). (#3463)
- Trailing backslash is automatically escaped when dealing with native command arguments. (#4965)
- Ignore the `-ExecutionPolicy` switch when running PowerShell on non-Windows platforms because script signing is not currently supported. (#3481)
- Fixed ConsoleHost to honor `NoEcho` on Unix platforms. (#3801)
- Fixed `Get-Help` to support case insensitive pattern matching on Unix platforms. (#3852)
- `powershell` man-page added to package

### Logging

On macOS, PowerShell uses the native `os_log` APIs to log to Apple's [unified logging system][os_log].
On Linux, PowerShell uses [Syslog][], a ubiquitous logging solution.

### Filesystem

A number of changes have been made on macOS and Linux to support filename characters not traditionally supported on Windows:

- Paths given to cmdlets are now slash-agnostic (both / and \ work as directory separator)
- XDG Base Directory Specification is now respected and used by default:
  - The Linux/macOS profile path is located at `~/.config/powershell/profile.ps1`
  - The history save path is located at `~/.local/share/powershell/PSReadline/ConsoleHost_history.txt`
  - The user module path is located at `~/.local/share/powershell/Modules`
- Support for file and folder names containing the colon character on Unix. (#4959)
- Support for script names or full paths that have commas. (#4136) (Thanks to @TimCurwick!)
- Detect when `-LiteralPath` is used to suppress wildcard expansion for navigation cmdlets. (#5038)
- Updated `Get-ChildItem` to work more like the *nix `ls -R` and the Windows `DIR /S` native commands.
  `Get-ChildItem` now returns the symbolic links encountered during a recursive search and does not search the directories that those links target. (#3780)

### Case sensitivity

Linux and macOS tend to be case-sensitive while Windows is case-insensitive while preserving case.
In general, PowerShell is case insensitive.

For example, environment variables are case-sensitive on macOS and Linux,
so the casing of the `PSModulePath` environment variable has been standardized. (#3255)
`Import-Module` is case insensitive when it's using a file path to determine the module's name. (#5097)

## Support for side-by-side installations

PowerShell Core is installed, configured, and executed separately from Windows PowerShell.
PowerShell Core has a "portable" ZIP package.
Using the ZIP package, you can install any number of versions anywhere on disk, including local to an application that takes PowerShell as a dependency.
Side-by-side installation makes it easier to test new versions of PowerShell and migrating existing scripts over time.
Side-by-side also enables backwards compatibility as scripts can be pinned to specific versions that they require.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the MSI-based installer on Windows does an in-place update install.
>

## Renamed `powershell(.exe)` to `pwsh(.exe)`

The binary name for PowerShell Core has been changed from `powershell(.exe)` to `pwsh(.exe)`.
This change provides a deterministic way for users to run PowerShell Core on machines to support side-by-side Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core installations.
`pwsh` is also much shorter and easier to type.

Additional changes to `pwsh(.exe)` from `powershell.exe`:

- Changed the first positional parameter from `-Command` to `-File`.
  This change fixes the usage of `#!` (aka as a shebang) in PowerShell scripts that are being executed from non-PowerShell shells on non-Windows platforms.
  It also means that you can run commands like `pwsh foo.ps1` or `pwsh fooScript` without specifying `-File`.
  However, this change requires that you explicitly specify `-c` or `-Command` when trying to run commands like `pwsh.exe -Command Get-Command`. (#4019)
- PowerShell Core accepts the `-i` (or `-Interactive`) switch to indicate an interactive shell. (#3558)
  This allows PowerShell to be used as a default shell on Unix platforms.
- Removed parameters `-importsystemmodules` and `-psconsoleFile` from `pwsh.exe`. (#4995)
- Changed `pwsh -version` and built-in help for `pwsh.exe` to align with other native tools. (#4958 & #4931) (Thanks @iSazonov)
- Invalid argument error messages for `-File` and `-Command` and exit codes consistent with Unix standards (#4573)
- Added `-WindowStyle` parameter on Windows. (#4573)
 Similarly, package-based installations updates on non-Windows platforms are in-place updates.

## Backwards compatibility with Windows PowerShell

The goal of PowerShell Core is to remain as compatible as possible with Windows PowerShell.
PowerShell Core uses [.NET Standard][] 2.0 to provide binary compatibility with existing .NET assemblies.
Many PowerShell modules depend on these assemblies (often times DLLs), so .NET Standard allows them to continue working with .NET Core.
PowerShell Core also includes a heuristic to look in well-known folders--like where the Global Assembly Cache typically resides on disk--to find .NET Framework DLL dependencies.

You can learn more about .NET Standard on the [.NET Blog][], in this [YouTube][] video, and via this [FAQ][] on GitHub.

Best efforts have been made to ensure that the PowerShell language and "built-in" modules (like `Microsoft.PowerShell.Management`, `Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility`, etc.) work the same as they do in Windows PowerShell.
In many cases, with the help of the community, we've added new capabilities and bug fixes to those cmdlets.
In some cases, due to a missing dependency in underlying .NET layers, functionality was removed or is unavailable.

Most of the modules that ship as part of Windows (for example, `DnsClient`, `Hyper-V`, `NetTCPIP`, `Storage`, etc.) and other Microsoft products including Azure and Office have not been *explicitly* ported to .NET Core yet.
The PowerShell team is working with these product groups and teams to validate and port their existing modules to PowerShell Core.
With .NET Standard and [CDXML][], many of these traditional Windows PowerShell modules do seem to work in PowerShell Core,
but they have not been formally validated, and they are not formally supported.

By installing the [`WindowsPSModulePath`][windowspsmodulepath] module,
you can use Windows PowerShell modules by appending the Windows PowerShell `PSModulePath` to your PowerShell Core `PSModulePath`.

First, install the `WindowsPSModulePath` module from the PowerShell Gallery:

```powershell
# Add `-Scope CurrentUser` if you're installing as non-admin
Install-Module WindowsPSModulePath -Force
```

After installing this module,
run the `Add-WindowsPSModulePath` cmdlet to add the Windows PowerShell `PSModulePath` to PowerShell Core:

```powershell
# Add this line to your profile if you always want Windows PowerShell PSModulePath
Add-WindowsPSModulePath
```

## Docker support

PowerShell Core adds support for Docker containers for all the major platforms we support
(including multiple Linux distros, Windows Server Core, and Nano Server).

For a complete list, check out the tags on [`microsoft/powershell` on Docker Hub][docker-hub].
For more information on Docker and PowerShell Core, see [Docker][] on GitHub.

## SSH-based PowerShell Remoting

The PowerShell Remoting Protocol (PSRP) now works with the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol in addition to the traditional WinRM-based PSRP.

This means that you can use cmdlets like `Enter-PSSession` and `New-PSSession` and authenticate using SSH.
All you have to do is register PowerShell as a subsystem with an OpenSSH-based SSH server,
and you can use your existing SSH-based authenticate mechanisms (like passwords or private keys) with the traditional `PSSession` semantics.

For more information on configuring and using SSH-based remoting,
see [PowerShell Remoting over SSH][ssh-remoting].

## Default encoding is UTF-8 without a BOM except for New-ModuleManifest

In the past, Windows PowerShell cmdlets like `Get-Content`, `Set-Content` used different encodings, such as ASCII and UTF-16.
The variance in encoding defaults created problems when mixing cmdlets without specifying an encoding.

Non-Windows platforms traditionally use UTF-8 without a Byte Order Mark (BOM) as the default encoding for text files.
More Windows applications and tools are moving away from UTF-16 and towards BOM-less UTF-8 encoding.
PowerShell Core changes the default encoding to conform with the broader ecosystems.

This means that all built-in cmdlets that use the `-Encoding` parameter use the `UTF8NoBOM` value by default.
The following cmdlets are affected by this change:

- Add-Content
- Export-Clixml
- Export-Csv
- Export-PSSession
- Format-Hex
- Get-Content
- Import-Csv
- Out-File
- Select-String
- Send-MailMessage
- Set-Content

These cmdlets have also been updated so that the `-Encoding` parameter universally accepts `System.Text.Encoding`.

The default value of `$OutputEncoding` has also been changed to UTF-8.

As a best practice, you should explicitly set encodings in scripts using the `-Encoding` parameter to produce deterministic behavior across platforms.

`New-ModuleManifest` cmdlet does not have **Encoding** parameter. The encoding of the module manifest (.psd1) file created with `New-ModuleManifest` cmdlet depends on environment: if it is PowerShell Core running on Linux then encoding is UTF-8 (no BOM); otherwise encoding is UTF-16 (with BOM). (#3940)

## Support backgrounding of pipelines with ampersand (`&`) (#3360)

Putting `&` at the end of a pipeline causes the pipeline to be run as a PowerShell job.
When a pipeline is backgrounded, a job object is returned.
Once the pipeline is running as a job, all of the standard `*-Job` cmdlets can be used to manage the job.
Variables (ignoring process-specific variables) used in the pipeline are automatically copied to the job so `Copy-Item $foo $bar &` just works.
The job is also run in the current directory instead of the user's home directory.
For more information about PowerShell jobs, see [about_Jobs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/reference/6/about/about_jobs).

## Semantic versioning

- Made `SemanticVersion` compatible with `SemVer 2.0`. (#5037) (Thanks @iSazonov!)
- Changed default `ModuleVersion` in `New-ModuleManifest` to `0.0.1` to align with SemVer. (#4842) (Thanks @LDSpits)
- Added `semver` as a type accelerator for `System.Management.Automation.SemanticVersion`. (#4142) (Thanks to @oising!)
- Enabled comparison between a `SemanticVersion` instance and a `Version` instance that is constructed only with `Major` and `Minor` version values.

## Language updates

- Implement Unicode escape parsing so that users can use Unicode characters as arguments, strings, or variable names. (#3958) (Thanks to @rkeithhill!)
- Added new escape character for ESC: `` `e``
- Added support for converting enums to string (#4318) (Thanks @KirkMunro)
- Fixed casting single element array to a generic collection. (#3170)
- Added character range overload to the `..` operator, so `'a'..'z'` returns characters from 'a' to 'z'. (#5026) (Thanks @IISResetMe!)
- Fixed variable assignment to not overwrite read-only variables
- Push locals of automatic variables to 'DottedScopes' when dotting script cmdlets (#4709)
- Enable use of 'Singleline, Multiline' option in split operator (#4721) (Thanks @iSazonov)

## Engine updates

- `$PSVersionTable` has four new properties:
  - `PSEdition`: This is set to `Core` on PowerShell Core and `Desktop` on Windows PowerShell
  - `GitCommitId`: This is the Git commit ID of the Git branch or tag where PowerShell was built.
    On released builds, it will likely be the same as `PSVersion`.
  - `OS`: This is an OS version string returned by `[System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation]::OSDescription`
  - `Platform`: This is returned by `[System.Environment]::OSVersion.Platform`
    It is set to `Win32NT` on Windows, `Unix` on macOS, and `Unix` on Linux.
- Removed the `BuildVersion` property from `$PSVersionTable`.
  This property was strongly tied to the Windows build version.
  Instead, we recommend that you use `GitCommitId` to retrieve the exact build version of PowerShell Core. (#3877) (Thanks to @iSazonov!)
- Remove `ClrVersion` property from `$PSVersionTable`.
  This property is irrelevant for .NET Core, and was only preserved in .NET Core for specific legacy purposes that are inapplicable to PowerShell.
- Added three new automatic variables to determine whether PowerShell is running in a given OS:
  `$IsWindows`, `$IsMacOs`, and `$IsLinux`.
- Add `GitCommitId` to PowerShell Core banner.
  Now you don't have to run `$PSVersionTable` as soon as you start PowerShell to get the version! (#3916) (Thanks to @iSazonov!)
- Add a JSON config file called `powershell.config.json` in `$PSHome` to store some settings required before startup time (e.g. `ExecutionPolicy`).
- Don't block pipeline when running Windows EXE's
- Enabled enumeration of COM collections. (#4553)

  $p | Foreach-Object Prio<tab>
  ```

- Add Hashtable tab completion for `-Property` of `Select-Object`. (#3625) (Thanks to @powercode)

## Breaking changes

We've introduced a number of breaking changes in PowerShell Core 6.0.
To read more about them in detail, see [Breaking Changes in PowerShell Core 6.0][breaking-changes].

## Debugging

- Support for remote step-in debugging for `Invoke-Command -ComputerName`. (#3015)
- Enable binder debug logging in PowerShell Core

## Filesystem updates

- Enable usage of the Filesystem provider from a UNC path. ($4998)
- `Split-Path` now works with UNC roots
- `cd` with no arguments now behaves as `cd ~`
- Fixed PowerShell Core to allow use of paths that are more than 260 characters long. (#3960)

## Bug fixes and performance improvements

We've made *many* improvements to performance across PowerShell,
including in startup time, various built-in cmdlets, and interaction with native binaries.

We've also fixed a number of bugs within PowerShell Core.
For a complete list of fixes and changes, check out our [changelog][] on GitHub.

## Telemetry

- PowerShell Core 6.0 added telemetry to the console host to report two values (#3620):
  - the OS platform (`$PSVersionTable.OSDescription`)
  - the exact version of PowerShell (`$PSVersionTable.GitCommitId`)

If you want to opt-out of this telemetry, simply delete `$PSHome\DELETE_ME_TO_DISABLE_CONSOLEHOST_TELEMETRY`
or create `POWERSHELL_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` environment variable with one of the following values: `true`, `1` or `yes`.
Deleting this file or creating the variable bypasses all telemetry even before the first run of PowerShell.
We also plan on exposing this telemetry data and the insights we glean from the telemetry in the [community dashboard][community-dashboard].
You can find out more about how we use this data in this [blog post][telemetry-blog].
