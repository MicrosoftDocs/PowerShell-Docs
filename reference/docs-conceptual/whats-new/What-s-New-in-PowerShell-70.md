# What's New in PowerShell 7.0

PowerShell 7.0 is an open-source, cross-platform (Windows, macOS, and Linux) edition of PowerShell,
built to manage heterogeneous environments and hybrid cloud.

In this release, we're introducing a number of new features, including:

- Pipeline parallelization with `ForEach-Object -Parallel`
- New operators:
  - Ternary operator: `a ? b : c`
  - Pipeline chain operators: `||` and `&&`
  - Null conditional operators: `??` and `??=`
- A simplified and dynamic error view and `Get-Error` cmdlet for easier investigation of errors
- A compatibility layer that enables users to import modules in an implicit Windows PowerShell session
- Automatic new version notifications
- The ability to invoke DSC resources directly from PowerShell 7 (experimental)

To see a full list of features and fixes, see the [changelogs](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/CHANGELOG/7.0.md).

## Where can I install PowerShell?

PowerShell 7 currently supports the following operating systems on x64, including:

- Windows 8.1, and 10
- Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2, 2016, and 2019
- macOS 10.13+
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) / CentOS 7
- Fedora 30+
- Debian 9
- Ubuntu LTS 16.04+
- Alpine Linux 3.8+

Additionally, PowerShell 7.0 supports ARM32 and ARM64 flavors of Debian, Ubuntu, and ARM64 Alpine
Linux.

Check the installation instructions for your preferred operating system
[Windows](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-7),
[macOS](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-macos?view=powershell-7),
or
[Linux](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7).

While not officially supported, the community has also provided packages for
[Arch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/powershell/) and Kali Linux.

> [!NOTE]
> Debian 10 and CentOS 8 currently do not support WinRM remoting. For details on setting up
> SSH-based remoting, see
> [PowerShell Remoting over SSH](/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/ssh-remoting-in-powershell-core?view=powershell-7).

For more up-to-date information about supported operating systems and support lifecycle, see the
[PowerShell Support Lifecycle](/powershell/scripting/powershell-support-lifecycle?view=powershell-7).

## Running PowerShell 7

PowerShell 7 installs to a new directory and runs side-by-side with Windows PowerShell 5.1. For
PowerShell Core 6.x, PowerShell 7 is an in-place upgrade that removes PowerShell Core 6.x.

- Windows PowerShell 5.1 : `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0` will add
`%programfiles%\PowerShell\7`

PowerShell 7 will upgrade previous versions of PowerShell Core 6.x:

- PowerShell Core 6.x on Windows: `%programfiles%\PowerShell\6` is replaced by
 `%programfiles%\PowerShell\7`
- Linux: `/opt/microsoft/powershell/6` is replaced by
`/opt/microsoft/powershell/7`
- macOS: `/usr/local/microsoft/powershell/6` is replaced by
`/usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7`

> [!NOTE]
> In Windows PowerShell, the executable to launch PowerShell is named `powershell.exe`. In version 6
> and above, the executable is changed to support side-by-side execution. The new executable to
> launch PowerShell 7 is `pwsh.exe`. Preview builds will remain in-place as `pwsh-preview` instead
> of `pwsh` under the 7-preview directory.

## Improved backwards compatibility with Windows PowerShell

PowerShell 7.0 marks a move a to .NET Core 3.1, enabling significantly more backwards compatibility
with existing Windows PowerShell modules. This includes many modules on Windows that require GUI
functionality like `Out-GridView` and `Show-Command`, as well as many role management modules that
ship as part of Windows.

For Windows, a new switch parameter **UseWindowsPowerShell** is added to `Import-Module`. This
switch creates a proxy module in PowerShell 7 that uses a local Windows PowerShell process to
implicitly run any cmdlets contained in that module. For more information on
[Import-Module](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/import-module?view=powershell-7).

For more information on which Microsoft modules work with PowerShell 7.0, see the
[Module Compatibility Table](https://aka.ms/PSModuleCompat).

## Parallel execution added to ForEach-Object

The `ForEach-Object` cmdlet, which iterates items in a collection, now has built-in parallelism with
the new **Parallel** parameter.

By default, parallel script blocks use the current working directory of the caller that started the
parallel tasks.

This example retrieves 50,000 log entries from 5 system logs on a local Windows machine:

```powershell
$logNames = 'Security','Application','System','Windows PowerShell','Microsoft-Windows-Store/Operational'

$logEntries = $logNames | ForEach-Object -Parallel {
    Get-WinEvent -LogName $_ -MaxEvents 10000
} -ThrottleLimit 5

$logEntries.Count

50000
```

The **Parallel** parameter specifies the script block that is run in parallel for each input log name.

The new **ThrottleLimit** parameter limits the number of script blocks running in parallel at a
given time. The default is 5.

Use the `$_` variable to represent the current input object in the script block. Use the
`$using:` scope to pass variable references to the running script block.

For more information about
[ForEach-Object](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/foreach-object?view=powershell-7).

## Ternary operator

PowerShell 7.0 introduces a ternary operator which behaves like a simplified `if-else` statement.
PowerShell's ternary operator is closely modeled from the C# ternary operator syntax:

```
<condition> ? <if-true> : <if-false>
```

The condition-expression is always evaluated, and its result ware converted to a **Boolean** to
determine which branch is evaluated next:

- The `<if-true>` expression is executed if the `<condition>` expression is true
- The `<if-false>` expression is executed if the `<condition>` expression is false

For example:

```powershell
$message = (Test-Path $path) ? "Path exists" : "Path not found"
```

In this example, if the path exists, then **Path exists** is displayed. If the path does not exist,
then **Path not found** is displayed.

For more information
[About If](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_if?view=powershell-7).

## Pipeline chain operators

PowerShell 7 implements the `&&` and `||` operators to conditionally chain pipelines. These
operators are known in PowerShell as "pipeline chain operators", and are similar to AND and OR lists
in shells like **Bash** and **Zsh**, as well as conditional processing symbols in the
Windows Command Shell (**cmd.exe**).

The `&&` operator executes the right-hand pipeline, if the left-hand pipeline succeeded. Conversely,
the `||` operator executes the right-hand pipeline if the left-hand pipeline failed.

> [!NOTE]
> These operators use the `$?` and `$LASTEXITCODE` variables to determine if a pipeline
> failed. This allows you to use them with native commands and not just with cmdlets or functions.

Here, the first command succeeds and the second command is executed:

```powershell
Write-Output 'First' && Write-Output 'Second'
```

```Output
First
Second
```

Here, the first command fails, the second is not executed:

```powershell
Write-Error 'Bad' && Write-Output 'Second'
```

```Output
Write-Error: Bad
```

Here, the first command succeeds, the second command is not executed:

```powershell
Write-Output 'First' || Write-Output 'Second'
```

```Output
First
```

Here, the first command fails, so the second command is executed:

```powershell
Write-Error 'Bad' || Write-Output 'Second'
```

```Output
Write-Error 'Bad'
Second
```

For more information
[About Pipeline Chain Operators](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_pipeline_chain_operators?view=powershell-7).

## Null-coalescing, assignment, and conditional operators

PowerShell 7 includes Null coalescing operator `??`, Null conditional assignment `??=`, and Null
conditional member access operators `?.` and `?[]`.

### Null-coalescing Operator ??

The null-coalescing operator `??` returns the value of its left-hand operand if it isn't null.
Otherwise, it evaluates the right-hand operand and returns its result. The `??` operator doesn't
evaluate its right-hand operand if the left-hand operand evaluates to non-null.

```powershell
$x = $null
$x ?? 100
100
```

In the following example, the right-hand operand won't be evaluated:

```powershell
[string] $todaysDate = '1/10/2020'
$todaysDate ?? (Get-Date).ToShortDateString()
1/10/2020
```

### Null conditional assignment operator ??=

The null conditional assignment operator `??=` assigns the value of its right-hand operand to its
left-hand operand only if the left-hand operand evaluates to null. The `??=` operator doesn't
evaluate its right-hand operand if the left-hand operand evaluates to non-null.

```powershell
$x = $null
$x ??= 100
$x
100
```

In the following example, the right-hand operand won't be evaluated:

```powershell
[string] $todaysDate = '1/10/2020'
$todaysDate ??= (Get-Date).ToShortDateString()
1/10/2020
```

### Null conditional member access operators ?. and ?[] (Experimental)

> [!NOTE]
> This is an experimental feature named **PSNullConditionalOperators**. To learn more
> [About Experimental Features](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_experimental_features?view=powershell-7).

A null conditional operator permits member access, `?.`, or element access, `?[]`, to its operand
only if that operand evaluates to non-null; otherwise, it returns null.

> [!NOTE]
> Since PowerShell allows `?` to be part of the variable name, formal specification of the
> variable name is required for using these operators. So it is required to use `{}` around the
> variable names like `${a}` or when `?` is part of the variable name `${a?}`.

In the following example, the value of the member property **Status** is returned:

```powershell
$Service = Get-Service -Name 'bits'
${Service}?.status
Stopped
```

The following example will return null, without trying to access the member name **Status**:

```powershell
$service = $Null
${Service}?.status
```

Similarly, using `?[]`, the value of the element will be returned:

```powershell
$a = 1..10
${a}?[0]
1
```

And when the operand is null, the element isn't accessed and null is returned:

```powershell
$a = $null
${a}?[0]
```

For more information
[About_Operators](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_operators?view=powershell-7).

## New view ConciseView and cmdlet Get-Error

The display of error messages has been improved to enhance the readability of interactive and script
errors with a new default view **ConciseView**. The views are user-selectable through the preference
variable `$ErrorView`.

With **ConciseView**, if an error is not from a script or parser error, then
it's a single line error message:

```powershell
Get-Childitem -Path c:\NotReal
```

```Output
Get-ChildItem: Cannot find path 'C:\NotReal' because it does not exist
```

If the error occurs during script execution or is a parsing error, PowerShell returns a multiline
error message that contains the error, a pointer and error message showing where the error is in
that line. If the terminal doesn't support ANSI color escape sequences (VT100), then colors are not displayed.

![Error display from a script](./media/What-s-New-in-PowerShell-70/myscript-error.png)

The default view in PowerShell 7 is **ConciseView**. The previous default view **NormalView** are
user selectable by setting the preference variable `$ErrorView`.

```powershell
$ErrorView = 'NormalView' # Sets the error view to NormalView
$ErrorView = 'ConciseView' # Sets the error view to ConciseView
```

> [!NOTE]
> A new property **ErrorAccentColor** is added to `$Host.PrivateData` to support changing
> the accent color of the error message.

A new cmdlet `Get-Error` provides complete detailed view of the fully qualified error when desired.
By default the cmdlet displays the full details, including inner exceptions, of the last error that
occurred.

![Display from Get-Error](./media/What-s-New-in-PowerShell-70/myscript-geterror.png)

The `Get-Error` cmdlet supports input from the pipeline using the built-in variable `$Error`.
`Get-Error` displays all piped errors.

```powershell
$Error | Get-Error
```

The `Get-Error` cmdlet supports the **Newest** parameter, allowing you to specify how many errors
from the current session you wish displayed.

```powershell
Get-Error -Newest 3 # Displays the lst three errors that occurred in the session
```

For more information about [Get-Error](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-error?view=powershell-7).

## New version notification

PowerShell 7 uses update notifications to alert users to the existence of updates to PowerShell.
Once per day, PowerShell queries an online service to determine if a newer version is available.

> [!NOTE]
> The update check happens during the first session in a given 24-hour period. For performance
> reasons, the update check starts 3 seconds after the session begins. The notification is shown
> only on the start of subsequent sessions.

By default, PowerShell subscribes to one of two different notification channels depending on its
version/branch. Supported, Generally Available (GA) versions of PowerShell only return notifications
for updated GA releases. Preview and Release Candidate (RC) releases notify of updates to preview,
RC, and GA releases.

The update notification behavior can be changed using the `$Env:POWERSHELL_UPDATECHECK` environment
variable. The following values are supported:

- **Default** is the same as not defining `$Env:POWERSHELL_UPDATECHECK`
  - GA releases notify of updates to GA releases
  - Preview/RC releases notify of updates to GA and preview releases
- **Off** turns off the update notification feature
- **LTS** only notifies of updates to long-term-servicing (LTS) GA releases

> [!NOTE]
> The environment variable `$Env:POWERSHELL_UPDATECHECK` does not exist until it is set for
> the first time.

To set the version notification for `LTS` releases only:

```powershell
$Env:POWERSHELL_UPDATECHECK = 'LTS'
```

To set the version notification to the `Default` behavior:

```powershell
$Env:POWERSHELL_UPDATECHECK = 'Default'
```

For more information [About Update Notifications](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_update_notifications?view=powershell-7).

## New DSC Resource support with Invoke-DSCResource (Experimental)

> [!NOTE]
> This is an experimental feature named **PSDesiredStateConfiguration.InvokeDscResource**. To learn
> more
> [About Experimental Features](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_experimental_features?view=powershell-7).

The `Invoke-DscResource` cmdlet runs a method of a specified PowerShell Desired State Configuration
(DSC) resource.

This cmdlet invokes a DSC resource directly, without creating a configuration document. Using this
cmdlet, configuration management products can manage Windows or Linux by using DSC resources. This
cmdlet also enables debugging of resources when the DSC engine is running with debugging enabled.

This command invokes the **Set** method of a resource named Log and specifies a **Message** property.

```powershell
Invoke-DscResource -Name Log -Method Set -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration -Property @{
  Message = 'Hello World'
}
```

[Invoke-DSCResource](/powershell/module/psdesiredstateconfiguration/invoke-dscresource?view=powershell-7).
