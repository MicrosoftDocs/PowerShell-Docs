# Breaking Changes for PowerShell 6.x

## Features no longer available in PowerShell Core

### PowerShell Workflow

[PowerShell Workflow][workflow] is a feature in Windows PowerShell that builds on top of [Windows Workflow Foundation (WF)][workflow-foundation] that enables the creation of robust runbooks for long-running or parallelized tasks.

Due to the lack of support for Windows Workflow Foundation in .NET Core, we will not continue to
support PowerShell Workflow in PowerShell Core.

In the future, we would like to enable native parallelism/concurrency in the PowerShell language
without the need for PowerShell Workflow.

If there is a need to use checkpoints to resume a script after the OS restarts, we recommend
using Task Scheduler to run a script on OS startup, but the script would need to maintain
its own state (like persisting it to a file).

[workflow-foundation]: https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/

### Custom snap-ins

[PowerShell snap-ins][snapin] are a predecessor to PowerShell modules that do not have widespread
adoption in the PowerShell community.

Due to the complexity of supporting snap-ins and their lack of usage in the community, we no longer
support custom snap-ins in PowerShell Core.

Today, this breaks the `ActiveDirectory` and `DnsClient` modules in Windows and Windows Server.

### WMI v1 cmdlets

Due to the complexity of supporting two sets of WMI-based modules, we removed the WMI v1 cmdlets
from PowerShell Core:

- `Get-WmiObject`
- `Invoke-WmiMethod`
- `Register-WmiEvent`
- `Set-WmiInstance`

Instead, we recommend that you the use the CIM (aka WMI v2) cmdlets which provide the same
functionality with new functionality and a redesigned syntax:

- `Get-CimAssociatedInstance`
- `Get-CimClass`
- `Get-CimInstance`
- `Get-CimSession`
- `Invoke-CimMethod`
- `New-CimInstance`
- `New-CimSession`
- `New-CimSessionOption`
- `Register-CimIndicationEvent`
- `Remove-CimInstance`
- `Remove-CimSession`
- `Set-CimInstance`

### Microsoft.PowerShell.LocalAccounts

Due to the use of unsupported APIs, `Microsoft.PowerShell.LocalAccounts` has been removed from
PowerShell Core until a better solution is found.

### `*-Computer` cmdlets

Due to the use of unsupported APIs, the following cmdlets have been removed from PowerShell Core until a
better solution is found.

- Add-Computer
- Checkpoint-Computer
- Remove-Computer
- Restore-Computer

### `*-Counter` cmdlets

Due to the use of unsupported APIs, the `*-Counter` has been removed from PowerShell Core until a
better solution is found.

### `*-EventLog` cmdlets

Due to the use of unsupported APIs, the `*-EventLog` has been removed from PowerShell Core. until a
better solution is found. `Get-WinEvent` and `Create-WinEvent` are available to get and create
events on Windows.

## Engine/language changes

### Rename `powershell.exe` to `pwsh.exe` [#5101](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5101)

In order to give users a deterministic way to call PowerShell Core on Windows (as opposed to
Windows PowerShell), the PowerShell Core binary was changed to `pwsh.exe` on Windows and `pwsh` on
non-Windows platforms.

The shortened name is also consistent with naming of shells on non-Windows platforms.

### Don't insert line breaks to output (except for tables) [#5193](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5193)

Previously, output was aligned to the width of the console and line breaks were added at the end
width of the console, meaning the output didn't get reformatted as expected if the terminal was
resized. This change was not applied to tables, as the line breaks are necessary to keep the columns
aligned.

### Skip null-element check for collections with a value-type element type [#5432](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5432)

For the `Mandatory` parameter and `ValidateNotNull` and `ValidateNotNullOrEmpty` attributes, skip
the null-element check if the collection's element type is value type.

### Change `$OutputEncoding` to use `UTF-8 NoBOM` encoding rather than ASCII [#5369](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5369)

The previous encoding, ASCII (7-bit), would result in incorrect alteration of the output in some
cases. This change is to make `UTF-8 NoBOM` default, which preserves Unicode output with an encoding
supported by most tools and operating systems.

### Remove `AllScope` from most default aliases [#5268](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5268)

To speed up scope creation, `AllScope` was removed from most default aliases. `AllScope` was left
for a few frequently used aliases where the lookup was faster.

### `-Verbose` and `-Debug` no longer overrides `$ErrorActionPreference` [#5113](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5113)

Previously, if `-Verbose` or `-Debug` were specified, it overrode the behavior of
`$ErrorActionPreference`. With this change, `-Verbose` and `-Debug` no longer affect the behavior
of `$ErrorActionPreference`.

## Cmdlet changes

### Invoke-RestMethod doesn't return useful info when no data is returned. [#5320](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5320)

When an API returns just `null`, Invoke-RestMethod was serializing this as the string `"null"`
instead of `$null`. This change fixes the logic in `Invoke-RestMethod` to properly serialize a
valid single value JSON `null` literal as `$null`.

### Remove `-Protocol` from `*-Computer` cmdlets [#5277](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5277)

Due to issues with RPC remoting in CoreFX (particularly on non-Windows platforms) and ensuring a
consistent remoting experience in PowerShell, the `-Protocol` parameter was removed from the
`\*-Computer` cmdlets. DCOM is no longer supported for remoting. The following cmdlets only support
WSMAN remoting:

- Rename-Computer
- Restart-Computer
- Stop-Computer

### Remove `-ComputerName` from `*-Service` cmdlets [#5090](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5094)

In order to encourage the consistent use of PSRP, the `-ComputerName` parameter was removed from
`*-Service` cmdlets.

### Fix `Get-Item -LiteralPath a*b` if `a*b` doesn't actually exist to return error [#5197](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5197)

Previously, `-LiteralPath` given a wildcard would treat it the same as `-Path` and if the wildcard
found no files, it would silently exit. Correct behavior should be that `-LiteralPath` is literal
so if the file doesn't exist, it should error. Change is to treat wildcards used with `-Literal` as
literal.

### `Import-Csv` should apply `PSTypeNames` upon import when type information is present in the CSV [#5134](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5134)

Previously, objects exported using `Export-CSV` with `TypeInformation` imported with
`ConvertFrom-Csv` were not retaining the type information. This change adds the type information to
`PSTypeNames` member if available from the CSV file.

### `-NoTypeInformation` should be default on `Export-Csv` [#5131](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5131)

This change was made to address customer feedback on the default behavior of `Export-CSV` to
include type information.

Previously, the cmdlet would output a comment as the first line containing the type name of the
object. The change is to suppress this by default as it's not understood by most tools. Use
`-IncludeTypeInformation` to retain the previous behavior.

### Web Cmdlets should warn when `-Credential` is sent over unencrypted connections [#5112](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5112)

When using HTTP, content including passwords are sent as clear-text. This change is to not allow
this by default and return an error if credentials are being passed in an insecure manner. Users
can bypass this by using the `-AllowUnencryptedAuthentication` switch.

## API changes

### Remove `AddTypeCommandBase` class [#5407](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5407)

The `AddTypeCommandBase` class was removed from `Add-Type` to improve performance. This class is
only used by the Add-Type cmdlet and should not impact users.

### Unify cmdlets with parameter `-Encoding` to be of type `System.Text.Encoding` [#5080](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5080)

The `-Encoding` value `Byte` has been removed from the filesystem provider cmdlets. A new
parameter, `-AsByteStream`, is now used to specify that a byte stream is required as input or that
the output is a stream of bytes.

### Add better error message for empty and null `-UFormat` parameter [#5055](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5055)

Previously, when passing an empty format string to `-UFormat`, an unhelpful error message would
appear. A more descriptive error has been added.

### Clean up console code [#4995](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4995)

The following features were removed as they are not supported in PowerShell Core, and there are no
plans to add support as they exist for legacy reasons for Windows PowerShell: `-psconsolefile`
switch and code, `-importsystemmodules` switch and code, and font changing code.

### Removed `RunspaceConfiguration` support [#4942](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4942)

Previously, when creating a PowerShell runspace programmatically using the API you could use the
legacy [`RunspaceConfiguration`][runspaceconfig] or the newer [`InitialSessionState`][iss]. This
change removed support for `RunspaceConfiguration` and only supports `InitialSessionState`.

[runspaceconfig]: https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.runspaces.runspaceconfiguration
[iss]: https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.runspaces.initialsessionstate

### `CommandInvocationIntrinsics.InvokeScript` bind arguments to `$input` instead of `$args` [#4923](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4923)

An incorrect position of a parameter resulted in the args passed as input instead of as args.

### Remove unsupported `-showwindow` switch from `Get-Help` [#4903](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4903)

`-showwindow` relies on WPF, which is not supported on CoreCLR.

### Allow * to be used in registry path for `Remove-Item` [#4866](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4866)

Previously, `-LiteralPath` given a wildcard would treat it the same as `-Path` and if the wildcard
found no files, it would silently exit. Correct behavior should be that `-LiteralPath` is literal
so if the file doesn't exist, it should error. Change is to treat wildcards used with `-Literal` as
literal.

### Fix `Set-Service` failing test [#4802](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4802)

Previously, if `New-Service -StartupType foo` was used, `foo` was ignored and the service was
created with some default startup type. This change is to explicitly throw an error for an invalid
startup type.

### Rename `$IsOSX` to `$IsMacOS` [#4700](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4700)

The naming in PowerShell should be consistent with our naming and conform to Apple's use of macOS
instead of OSX. However, for readability and consistently we are staying with Pascal casing.

### Make error message consistent when invalid script is passed to -File, better error when passed ambiguous argument [#4573](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4573)

Change the exit codes of `pwsh.exe` to align with Unix conventions

### Removal of `LocalAccount` and cmdlets from  `Diagnostics` modules. [#4302](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4302) [#4303](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4303)

Due to unsupported APIs, the `LocalAccounts` module and the `Counter` cmdlets in the `Diagnostics`
module were removed until a better solution is found.

### Executing PowerShell script with bool parameter does not work [#4036](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4036)

Previously, using **powershell.exe** (now **pwsh.exe**) to execute a PowerShell script using `-File`
provided no way to pass `$true`/`$false` as parameter values. Support for `$true`/`$false` as parsed
values to parameters was added. Switch values are also supported as currently documented syntax
doesn't work.

### Remove `ClrVersion` property from `$PSVersionTable` [#4027](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4027)

The `ClrVersion` property of `$PSVersionTable` is not useful with CoreCLR, end users should not be
using that value to determine compatibility.

### Change positional parameter for `powershell.exe` from `-Command` to `-File` [#4019](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4019)

Enable shebang use of PowerShell on non-Windows platforms. This means on Unix based systems, you can
make a script executable that would invoke PowerShell automatically rather than explicitly invoking
`pwsh`. This also means that you can now do things like `powershell foo.ps1` or
`powershell fooScript` without specifying `-File`. However, this change now requires that you
explicitly specify `-c` or `-Command` when trying to do things like `powershell.exe Get-Command`.

### Implement Unicode escape parsing [#3958](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3958)

`` `u####`` or `` `u{####}`` is converted to the corresponding Unicode character. To output a
literal `` `u``, escape the backtick: ``` ``u```.

### Change `New-ModuleManifest` encoding to `UTF8NoBOM` on non-Windows platforms [#3940](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3940)

Previously, `New-ModuleManifest` creates psd1 manifests in UTF-16 with BOM, creating a problem for
Linux tools. This breaking change changes the encoding of `New-ModuleManifest` to be UTF (no BOM) in
non-Windows platforms.

### Prevent `Get-ChildItem` from recursing into symlinks (#1875). [#3780](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3780)

This change brings `Get-ChildItem` more in line with the Unix `ls -r` and the Windows `dir /s`
native commands. Like the mentioned commands, the cmdlet displays symbolic links to directories
found during recursion, but does not recurse into them.

### Fix `Get-Content -Delimiter` to not include the delimiter in the returned lines [#3706](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3706)

Previously, the output while using `Get-Content -Delimiter` was inconsistent and inconvenient as it
required further processing of the data to remove the delimiter. This change removes the delimiter
in returned lines.

### Implement Format-Hex in C# [#3320](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3320)

The `-Raw` parameter is now a "no-op" (in that it does nothing). Going forward all of the output
will be displayed with a true representation of numbers that includes all of the bytes for its type
(what the `-Raw` parameter was formally doing prior to this change).

### PowerShell as a default shell doesn't work with script command [#3319](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3319)

On Unix, it is a convention for shells to accept `-i` for an interactive shell and many tools
expect this behavior (`script` for example, and when setting PowerShell as the default shell) and
calls the shell with the `-i` switch. This change is breaking in that `-i` previously could be used
as short hand to match `-inputformat`, which now needs to be `-in`.

### Typo fix in Get-ComputerInfo property name [#3167](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3167)

`BiosSerialNumber` was misspelled as `BiosSeralNumber` and has been changed to the correct spelling.

### Add `Get-StringHash` and `Get-FileHash` cmdlets [#3024](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3024)

This change is that some hash algorithms are not supported by CoreFX, therefore they are no longer
available:

- `MACTripleDES`
- `RIPEMD160`

### Add validation on `Get-*` cmdlets where passing $null returns all objects instead of error [#2672](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/2672)

Passing `$null` to any of the following now throws an error:

- `Get-Credential -UserName`
- `Get-Event -SourceIdentifier`
- `Get-EventSubscriber -SourceIdentifier`
- `Get-Help -Name`
- `Get-PSBreakpoint -Script`
- `Get-PSProvider -PSProvider`
- `Get-PSSessionConfiguration -Name`
- `Get-PSSnapin -Name`
- `Get-Runspace -Name`
- `Get-RunspaceDebug -RunspaceName`
- `Get-Service -Name`
- `Get-TraceSource -Name`
- `Get-Variable -Name`
- `Get-WmiObject -Class`
- `Get-WmiObject -Property`

### Add support W3C Extended Log File Format in `Import-Csv` [#2482](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/2482)

Previously, the `Import-Csv` cmdlet cannot be used to directly import the log files in W3C extended
log format and additional action would be required. With this change, W3C extended log format is
supported.

### Parameter binding problem with `ValueFromRemainingArguments` in PS functions [#2035](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/2035)

`ValueFromRemainingArguments` now returns the values as an array instead of a single value which
itself is an array.

### `BuildVersion` is removed from `$PSVersionTable` [#1415](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1415)

Remove the `BuildVersion` property from `$PSVersionTable`. This property was tied to the Windows
build version. Instead, we recommend that you use `GitCommitId` to retrieve the exact build version
of PowerShell Core.

### Changes to Web Cmdlets

The underlying .NET API of the Web Cmdlets has been changed to `System.Net.Http.HttpClient`. This
change provides many benefits. However, this change along with a lack of interoperability with
Internet Explorer have resulted in several breaking changes within `Invoke-WebRequest` and
`Invoke-RestMethod`.

- `Invoke-WebRequest` now supports basic HTML Parsing only. `Invoke-WebRequest` always returns a
  `BasicHtmlWebResponseObject` object. The `ParsedHtml` and `Forms` properties have been removed.
- `BasicHtmlWebResponseObject.Headers` values are now `String[]` instead of `String`.
- `BasicHtmlWebResponseObject.BaseResponse` is now a `System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage` object.
- The `Response` property on Web Cmdlet exceptions is now a `System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage`
  object.
- Strict RFC header parsing is now default for the `-Headers` and `-UserAgent` parameter. This can
  be bypassed with `-SkipHeaderValidation`.
- `file://` and `ftp://` URI schemes are no longer supported.
- `System.Net.ServicePointManager` settings are no longer honored.
- There is currently no certificate based authentication available on macOS.
- Use of `-Credential` over an `http://` URI will result in an error. Use an `https://` URI or
  supply the `-AllowUnencryptedAuthentication` parameter to suppress the error.
- `-MaximumRedirection` now produces a terminating error when redirection attempts exceed the
  provided limit instead of returning the results of the last redirection.
- In PowerShell 6.2, a change was made to default to UTF-8 encoding for JSON responses. When a
  charset is not supplied for a JSON response, the default encoding should be UTF-8 per RFC 8259.
