# Working With Files, Folders and Registry Keys

Windows PowerShell uses the noun **Item** to refer to items found on a Windows PowerShell drive.
When dealing with the Windows PowerShell FileSystem provider, an **Item** might be a file, a folder,
or the Windows PowerShell drive. Listing and working with these items is a critical basic task in
most administrative settings, so we want to discuss these tasks in detail.

## Enumerating Files, Folders, and Registry Keys (Get-ChildItem)

Since getting a collection of items from a particular location is such a common task, the
`Get-ChildItem` cmdlet is designed specifically to return all items found within a container such as
a folder.

If you want to return all files and folders that are contained directly within the folder
C:\\Windows, type:

```
PS> Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Windows
    Directory: Microsoft.Windows PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\Windows

Mode                LastWriteTime     Length Name
----                -------------     ------ ----
-a---        2006-05-16   8:10 AM          0 0.log
-a---        2005-11-29   3:16 PM         97 acc1.txt
-a---        2005-10-23  11:21 PM       3848 actsetup.log
...
```

The listing looks similar to what you would see when you enter the `dir` command in **Cmd.exe**, or
the `ls` command in a UNIX command shell.

You can perform very complex listings by using parameters of the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet. We will
look at a few scenarios next. You can see the syntax the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet by typing:

```powershell
Get-Command -Name Get-ChildItem -Syntax
```

These parameters can be mixed and matched to get highly customized output.

### Listing all Contained Items (-Recurse)

To see both the items inside a Windows folder and any items that are contained within the
subfolders, use the **Recurse** parameter of `Get-ChildItem`. The listing displays everything within
the Windows folder and the items in its subfolders. For example:

```
PS> Get-ChildItem -Path C:\WINDOWS -Recurse

    Directory: Microsoft.Windows PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\WINDOWS
    Directory: Microsoft.Windows PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\WINDOWS\AppPatch
Mode                LastWriteTime     Length Name
----                -------------     ------ ----
-a---        2004-08-04   8:00 AM    1852416 AcGenral.dll
...
```

### Filtering Items by Name (-Name)

To display only the names of items, use the **Name** parameter of `Get-Childitem`:

```
PS> Get-ChildItem -Path C:\WINDOWS -Name
addins
AppPatch
assembly
...
```

### Forcibly Listing Hidden Items (-Force)

Items that are normally invisible in File Explorer or Cmd.exe are not displayed in the output of a
`Get-ChildItem` command. To display hidden items, use the **Force** parameter of `Get-ChildItem`.
For example:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Windows -Force
```

This parameter is named Force because you can forcibly override the normal behavior of the
`Get-ChildItem` command. Force is a widely used parameter that forces an action that a cmdlet would
not normally perform, although it will not perform any action that compromises the security of the
system.

### Matching Item Names with Wildcards

The `Get-ChildItem` command accepts wildcards in the path of the items to list.

Because wildcard matching is handled by the Windows PowerShell engine, all cmdlets that accepts
wildcards use the same notation and have the same matching behavior. The Windows PowerShell wildcard
notation includes:

- Asterisk (`*`) matches zero or more occurrences of any character.

- Question mark (`?`) matches exactly one character.

- Left bracket (`[`) character and right bracket (`]`) character surround a set of characters to be
  matched.

Here are some examples of how wildcard specification works.

To find all files in the Windows directory with the suffix `.log` and exactly five characters in the
base name, enter the following command:

```
PS> Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Windows\?????.log

    Directory: Microsoft.Windows PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\Windows
Mode                LastWriteTime     Length Name
----                -------------     ------ ----
...
-a---        2006-05-11   6:31 PM     204276 ocgen.log
-a---        2006-05-11   6:31 PM      22365 ocmsn.log
...
-a---        2005-11-11   4:55 AM         64 setup.log
-a---        2005-12-15   2:24 PM      17719 VxSDM.log
...
```

To find all files that begin with the letter `x` in the Windows directory, type:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Windows\x*
```

To find all files whose names begin with "x" or "z", type:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Windows\[xz]*
```

For more information about wildcards, see [about_Wildcards](powershell/reference/7.1/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Wildcards).

### Excluding Items (-Exclude)

You can exclude specific items by using the **Exclude** parameter of `Get-ChildItem`. This lets you
perform complex filtering in a single statement.

For example, suppose you are trying to find the Windows Time Service DLL in the **System32** folder,
and all you can remember about the DLL name is that it begins with "W" and has "32" in it.

An expression like `w*32*.dll` will find all DLLs that satisfy the conditions, but you may want to
further filter out the files and omit any win32 files. You can omit these files by using the
**Exclude** parameter with the pattern `win*`:

```
PS> Get-ChildItem -Path C:\WINDOWS\System32\w*32*.dll -Exclude win*

    Directory: C:\WINDOWS\System32

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a---           3/18/2019  9:43 PM         495616 w32time.dll
-a---           3/18/2019  9:44 PM          35328 w32topl.dll
-a---           1/24/2020  5:44 PM         401920 Wldap32.dll
-a---          10/10/2019  5:40 PM         442704 ws2_32.dll
-a---           3/18/2019  9:44 PM          66048 wsnmp32.dll
-a---           3/18/2019  9:44 PM          18944 wsock32.dll
-a---           3/18/2019  9:44 PM          64792 wtsapi32.dll
```

### Mixing Get-ChildItem Parameters

You can use several of the parameters of the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet in the same command. Before you
mix parameters, be sure that you understand wildcard matching. For example, the following command
returns no results:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Windows\*.dll -Recurse -Exclude [a-y]*.dll
```

There are no results, even though there are two DLLs that begin with the letter "z" in the Windows
folder.

No results were returned because we specified the wildcard as part of the path. Even though the
command was recursive, the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet restricted the items to those that are in the
Windows folder with names ending with `.dll`.

To specify a recursive search for files whose names match a special pattern, use the **Include**
parameter.

```
PS> Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Windows -Include *.dll -Recurse -Exclude [a-y]*.dll

    Directory: Microsoft.Windows PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\Windows\System32\Setup

Mode                LastWriteTime     Length Name
----                -------------     ------ ----
-a---        2004-08-04   8:00 AM       8261 zoneoc.dll

    Directory: Microsoft.Windows PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\Windows\System32

Mode                LastWriteTime     Length Name
----                -------------     ------ ----
-a---        2004-08-04   8:00 AM     337920 zipfldr.dll
```
