# Sample scripts for system administration

The fundamental goal of PowerShell is providing easy administrative control over systems, either
interactively or from script. This collection of examples walks through scenarios for administering
systems with PowerShell. The examples can be used from scripts or as functions later.

These examples use a mix of cmdlets and external tools. Use of external tools is part of the
long-term design intent of PowerShell. Even as the system grows, users continually encounter
situations where the available toolsets don't do everything they need. Rather than foster dependency
solely on cmdlet implementations, PowerShell solutions support integration with available external
tools.
