# PowerShell Support Lifecycle

PowerShell is a distinct set of tools and components that is shipped, installed, and configured
separately from Windows PowerShell. PowerShell isn't included in the Windows
licensing agreements.

PowerShell is supported under traditional Microsoft support agreements, including [paid support][],
[Microsoft Enterprise Agreements][enterprise-agreement], and [Microsoft Software Assurance][assurance].
You can also pay for [assisted support][] for PowerShell by filing a support request for your
problem.

## Community Support

We also offer [community support][] on GitHub where you can file an issue, bug, or feature request.
Also, you may find help from other members of the community in the Microsoft [PowerShell Tech Community][]
or any of the forums listed in the community section of [PowerShell][pshub] hub page. We offer no
guarantee there that the community will address or resolve your issue in a timely manner. If you
have a problem that requires immediate attention, you should use the traditional, paid support
options.

## Lifecycle of PowerShell 7

With the release of PowerShell 7, PowerShell continues to be supported under the [Microsoft Modern Lifecycle Policy][modern],
but support dates are linked to [.NET Core's support lifecycle][Long-Term]. In this servicing
approach, customers can choose Long Term Support (LTS) releases or Current releases. PowerShell 7.0
is an LTS release. Support ends with the support of .NET Core 3.1. The next LTS release follows the
next .NET Core LTS release. See the [PowerShell releases end of life table](#powershell-releases-end-of-life)
for current ending support dates. LTS release updates only contain critical security and servicing
updates and fixes that are designed to avoid or minimize impact to existing workloads.

A Current release is a release that occurs between LTS releases. Current releases can contain
critical fixes, innovations, and new features. A Current release is supported for three months after
the next Current or LTS release.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have the latest patch update installed to qualify for support. For example, if you're
> running PowerShell 7.0 and 7.0.1 has been released, you must update to 7.0.1 to qualify for
> support.

## Lifecycle of PowerShell Core 6.x

PowerShell Core used the [Microsoft Modern Lifecycle Policy][modern]. This support lifecycle
is intended to keep customers up-to-date with the latest versions.

The version 6.x branch of PowerShell Core was updated approximately once every six months (examples:
6.0, 6.1, 6.2, etc.). However, with the release of PowerShell 7, there won't be anymore minor
version releases of 6.x. PowerShell 6.2.x will continue to receive servicing updates while still
supported.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must update within six months after each new minor version release to continue receiving
> support.

For example, if PowerShell Core 6.1 is released on July 1, 2018, you would be expected to update to
PowerShell Core 6.1 by January 1, 2019 to maintain support.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must update within 30 days after each new patch version release to continue receiving support.

For example, If you're running PowerShell Core 6.1 and 6.1.3 was released on February 19, 2019, you
would be expected to update to PowerShell Core 6.1.3 by March 21, 2019, which is 30 days after the
release to maintain support. If any fixes are found to be required, the fixes will be released in
our next cumulative update.

The Modern Lifecycle Policy also requires that Microsoft give customers 12 months notice before
discontinuing support for a product (that is, PowerShell Core).

## Supported platforms

To confirm if your platform and version of PowerShell Core are officially supported, see the
following table.

Our community has also contributed packages for some platforms, but they aren't officially
supported. These packages are marked as `Community` in the table.

Platforms listed as `Experimental` aren't officially supported, but are available for
experimentation and feedback.

## PowerShell releases end of life

Based on the [Lifecycle of PowerShell](#lifecycle-of-powershell-7), the following table lists
the dates when various releases will no longer be supported.

| Version |    End-of-life     |
| :-----: | ------------------ |
|   7.0   | December 3, 2022   |
|   6.2   | September 4, 2020  |
|   6.1   | September 28, 2019 |
|   6.0   | February 13, 2019  |

> [!NOTE]
> This document is about support for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7. Windows PowerShell (1.0 -
> 5.1) is a component of the Windows OS. Components receive the same support as their parent product
> or platform. For more information, see [Product and Services Lifecycle Information](/lifecycle/products/)

## Unsupported platforms

When a platform version reaches end-of-life as defined by the platform owner, PowerShell Core will
also cease to support that platform version. Previously released packages will remain available for
customers needing access but formal support and updates of any kind will no longer be provided.

So, the distribution owners ended support for the following versions and aren't supported.

|    Platform    | Version |                                                         End of Life                                                          |

## Notes on licensing

PowerShell Core is released under the [MIT license][]. Under this license, and without a paid
support agreement, users are limited to [community support][]. With community support, Microsoft
makes no guarantees of responsiveness or fixes.

## Windows PowerShell Compatibility

The support lifecycle for PowerShell doesn't cover modules that ship outside of the PowerShell 7 release package. For
example, using the `ActiveDirectory` module that ships as part of Windows Server is supported under
the [Windows Support Lifecycle][].

PowerShell 7 improves compatibility with existing PowerShell modules written for Windows PowerShell.
For more information, see the [about_Windows_Compatibility][] article and the [module compatibility list][].

> [!NOTE]
> The [**WindowsPSModulePath**](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/WindowsPSModulePath) module is no longer necessary in PowerShell 7 and is not supported.

## Experimental features

[Experimental features][] are limited to [community support](#community-support).

## Security Servicing Criteria

PowerShell follows the [Microsoft Security Servicing Criteria for Windows][].
The table below outlines the features that meet the servicing criteria and those that do not.

| Feature                          | Type             |
|----------------------------------|------------------|
| Execution Policy                 | Defense in Depth |
| System Lockdown - with AppLocker | Defense in Depth |
| System Lockdown - with WDAC      | Security Feature |

## Release history

The following table contains a timeline of the major releases of PowerShell. This table is provided
for historical reference. It is not intended for use to determine the support lifecycle.
