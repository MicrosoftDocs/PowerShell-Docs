# PowerShell Core on ARM

Today, PowerShell Core works on some ARM devices,
including both Windows 10 ARM32/ARM64 and Raspbian, in an experimental, unsupported state.

For more information on installing these unsupported, experimental builds,
check out our installation instructions on GitHub for [Windows 10 IoT](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/installation/windows.md#deploying-on-windows-iot)
and [Raspbian](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/installation/linux.md#raspbian).

More information will be available here as our ARM64 story progresses.
Stay tuned!
