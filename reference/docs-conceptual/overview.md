# PowerShell

PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language built on .NET.
PowerShell helps system administrators and power-users rapidly automate tasks that manage
operating systems (Linux, macOS, and Windows) and processes.

PowerShell commands let you manage computers from the command line. PowerShell providers let you
access data stores, such as the registry and certificate store, as easily as you access the file
system. PowerShell includes a rich expression parser and a fully developed scripting language.

## PowerShell is open-source

PowerShell base source code is now available in GitHub and open to community contributions.
See [PowerShell source on GitHub](https://github.com/powershell/powershell).

You can start with the bits you need at [Get PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#get-powershell).
Or, perhaps, with a quick tour at [Getting Started](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/learning-powershell).

## PowerShell design goals

PowerShell is designed to improve the command-line and scripting environment by eliminating
long-standing problems and adding new features.

### Discoverability

PowerShell makes it easy to discover its features. For example, to find a list of cmdlets that view
and change Windows services, type:

```powershell
Get-Command *-Service
```

After discovering which cmdlet accomplishes a task, you can learn more about the cmdlet by using
the `Get-Help` cmdlet. For example, to display help about the `Get-Service` cmdlet, type:

```powershell
Get-Help Get-Service
```

Most cmdlets return objects that can be manipulated and then rendered as text for display. To fully
understand the output of a cmdlet, pipe the output to the `Get-Member` cmdlet. For example, the
following command displays information about the members of the object output by the `Get-Service`
cmdlet.

```powershell
Get-Service | Get-Member
```

### Consistency

Managing systems can be a complex task. Tools that have a consistent interface help to control the
inherent complexity. Unfortunately, command-line tools and scriptable COM objects aren't known for
their consistency.

The consistency of PowerShell is one of its primary assets. For example, if you learn how to use
the `Sort-Object` cmdlet, you can use that knowledge to sort the output of any cmdlet. You don't
have to learn the different sorting routines of each cmdlet.

Additionally, cmdlet developers don't have to design sorting features for their cmdlets. PowerShell
provides a framework with the basic features that forces consistency. The framework eliminates some
choices that are left to the developer. But, in return, it makes the development of cmdlets much
simpler.

### Interactive and scripting environments

The Windows Command Prompt provides an interactive shell with access to command-line tools and
basic scripting. Windows Script Host (WSH) has scriptable command-line tools and COM automation
objects, but doesn't provide an interactive shell.

PowerShell combines an interactive shell and a scripting environment. PowerShell can access
command-line tools, COM objects, and .NET class libraries. This combination of features extends the
capabilities of the interactive user, the script writer, and the system administrator.

### Object orientation

PowerShell is based on object not text. The output of a command is an object. You can send the
output object, through the pipeline, to another command as its input.

This pipeline provides a familiar interface for people experienced with other shells. PowerShell
extends this concept by sending objects rather than text.

### Easy transition to scripting

PowerShell's command discoverability makes it easy to transition from typing commands interactively
to creating and running scripts. PowerShell transcripts and history make it easy to copy commands
to a file for use as a script.
