# Auditing and Reporting on JEA

After you've deployed JEA, you need to regularly audit the JEA configuration. Auditing helps you
assess that the correct people have access to the JEA endpoint and their assigned roles are still
appropriate.

## Find registered JEA sessions on a machine

To check which JEA sessions are registered on a machine, use the
[Get-PSSessionConfiguration](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/get-pssessionconfiguration)
cmdlet.

```powershell
# Filter for sessions that are configured as 'RestrictedRemoteServer' to find JEA-like session configurations
Get-PSSessionConfiguration | Where-Object { $_.SessionType -eq 'RestrictedRemoteServer' }
```

```Output
Name          : JEAMaintenance
PSVersion     : 5.1
StartupScript :
RunAsUser     :
Permission    : CONTOSO\JEA_DNS_ADMINS AccessAllowed, CONTOSO\JEA_DNS_OPERATORS AccessAllowed,
                CONTOSO\JEA_DNS_AUDITORS AccessAllowed
```

The effective rights for the endpoint are listed in the **Permission** property. These users have
the right to connect to the JEA endpoint. However, the roles and commands they have access to is
determined by the **RoleDefinitions** property in the [session configuration file](session-configurations.md)
that was used to register the endpoint. Expand the **RoleDefinitions** property to evaluate the role
mappings in a registered JEA endpoint.

```powershell
# Get the desired session configuration
$jea = Get-PSSessionConfiguration -Name 'JEAMaintenance'

# Enumerate users/groups and which roles they have access to
$jea.RoleDefinitions.GetEnumerator() | Select-Object Name, @{
  Name = 'Role Capabilities'
  Expression = { $_.Value.RoleCapabilities }
}
```

## Find available role capabilities on the machine

JEA gets role capabilities from the `.psrc` files stored in the **RoleCapabilities** folder inside a
PowerShell module. The following function finds all role capabilities available on a computer.

```powershell
function Find-LocalRoleCapability {
    $results = @()

    # Find modules with a "RoleCapabilities" subfolder and add any PSRC files to the result set
    Get-Module -ListAvailable | ForEach-Object {
        $psrcpath = Join-Path -Path $_.ModuleBase -ChildPath 'RoleCapabilities'
        if (Test-Path $psrcpath) {
            $results += Get-ChildItem -Path $psrcpath -Filter *.psrc
        }
    }

    # Format the results nicely to make it easier to read
    $results | Select-Object @{ Name = 'Name'; Expression = { $_.Name.TrimEnd('.psrc') }}, @{
        Name = 'Path'; Expression = { $_.FullName }
    } | Sort-Object Name
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The order of results from this function is not necessarily the order in which the role
> capabilities will be selected if multiple role capabilities share the same name.

## Check effective rights for a specific user

The [Get-PSSessionCapability](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/Get-PSSessionCapability)
cmdlet enumerates all the commands available on a JEA endpoint based on a user's group memberships.
The output of `Get-PSSessionCapability` is identical to that of the specified user running
`Get-Command -CommandType All` in a JEA session.

```powershell
Get-PSSessionCapability -ConfigurationName 'JEAMaintenance' -Username 'CONTOSO\Alice'
```

If your users aren't permanent members of groups that would grant them additional JEA rights, this
cmdlet may not reflect those extra permissions. This happens when using just-in-time privileged
access management systems to allow users to temporarily belong to a security group. Carefully
evaluate the mapping of users to roles and capabilities to ensure that users only get the level of
access needed to do their jobs successfully.

## PowerShell event logs

If you enabled module or script block logging on the system, you can see events in the Windows event
logs for each command a user runs in a JEA session. To find these events, open
**Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational** event log and look for events with event ID **4104**.

Each event log entry includes information about the session in which the command was run. For JEA
sessions, the event includes information about the **ConnectedUser** and the **RunAsUser**. The
**ConnectedUser** is the actual user who created the JEA session. The **RunAsUser** is the account
JEA used to execute the command.

Application event logs show changes being made by the **RunAsUser**. So having module and script
logging enabled is required to trace a specific command invocation back to the **ConnectedUser**.

## Application event logs

Commands run in a JEA session that interact with external applications or services may log events to
their own event logs. Unlike PowerShell logs and transcripts, other logging mechanisms don't capture
the connected user of the JEA session. Instead, those applications only log the virtual run-as user.
To determine who ran the command, you need to consult a [session transcript](#session-transcripts)
or correlate PowerShell event logs with the time and user shown in the application event log.

The WinRM log can also help you correlate run-as users to the connecting user in an application
event log. Event ID **193** in the **Microsoft-Windows-Windows Remote Management/Operational** log
records the security identifier (SID) and account name for both the connecting user and run as user
for every new JEA session.

## Session transcripts

If you configured JEA to create a transcript for each user session, a text copy of every user's
actions are stored in the specified folder.

The following command (as an administrator) finds all transcript directories.

```powershell
Get-PSSessionConfiguration |
  Where-Object { $_.TranscriptDirectory -ne $null } |
    Format-Table Name, TranscriptDirectory
```

Each transcript starts with information about the time the session started, which user connected to
the session, and which JEA identity was assigned to them.

```
**********************
Windows PowerShell transcript start
Start time: 20160710144736
Username: CONTOSO\Alice
RunAs User: WinRM Virtual Users\WinRM VA_1_CONTOSO_Alice
Machine: SERVER01 (Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.14393.0)
[...]
```

The body of the transcript contains information about each command the user invoked. The exact
syntax of the command used is unavailable in JEA sessions because of the way commands are
transformed for PowerShell remoting. However, you can still determine the effective command that was
executed. Below is an example transcript snippet from a user running `Get-Service Dns` in a JEA
session:

```
PS>CommandInvocation(Get-Service): "Get-Service"
>> ParameterBinding(Get-Service): name="Name"; value="Dns"
>> CommandInvocation(Out-Default): "Out-Default"
>> ParameterBinding(Out-Default): name="InputObject"; value="Dns"

Running  Dns                DNS Server
```

A **CommandInvocation** line is written for each command a user runs. **ParameterBindings** record
each parameter and value supplied with the command. In the previous example, you can see that the
parameter **Name** was supplied the with value **Dns** for the `Get-Service` cmdlet.

The output of each command also triggers a **CommandInvocation**, usually to `Out-Default`. The
**InputObject** of `Out-Default` is the PowerShell object returned from the command. The details of
that object are printed a few lines below, closely mimicking what the user would have seen.
