# Using PSReadLine key handlers

The **PSReadLine** module provides key handlers that map **PSReadLine** functions to keyboard
chords. Keyboard chords are a sequence of one or more keystrokes that are pressed at the same time.
For example, the chord <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Spacebar</kbd> is the combination of the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
and <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> keys pressed at the same time. A **PSReadLine** function is a predefined
action that can be performed on a command line. For example, the `MenuComplete` function allows you
to choose from a list of options from a menu complete the input on the command line.

**PSReadLine** has several predefined key handlers that are bound by default. You can also define
your own custom key handlers. Run the following command to list the key handlers that are currently
defined.

```powershell
Get-PSReadLineKeyHandler
```

You can also get a list of all unbound **PSReadLine** functions that are available to be bound to a key chord.

```powershell
Get-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Unbound
```

You can use the `Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler` cmdlet to bind a function to a key handler. The following
command binds the `MenuComplete` function to the chord <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Spacebar</kbd>.

```powershell
Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Chord 'Ctrl+Spacebar' -Function MenuComplete
```

## Finding key names and chord bindings

The names of the keys in the chord are defined by the `[System.ConsoleKey]` enumeration. For more
information, see [System.ConsoleKey][01] documentation. For example, the name of the <kbd>2</kbd>
key in `[System.ConsoleKey]` is `D2`, whereas the name of the <kbd>2</kbd> key on the numeric keypad
is `NumPad2`. You can use the `[System.Console]::ReadKey()` method to find the name of the key you
pressed.

```powershell
[System.Console]::ReadKey()
```

The following output shows the information returned by the `ReadKey()` method for the
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd> key chord.

```Output
KeyChar Key Modifiers
------- --- ---------
        D2   Control
```

For the **PSReadLine** key handler cmdlets, this chord is represented as `Ctrl+D2`. The following
example binds this chord to a function.

```powershell
Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Chord 'Ctrl+D2' -Function MenuComplete
```

You can bind multiple cords to a single function. By default, the `BackwardDeleteChar` function is
bound to two chords.

```powershell
Get-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Chord Backspace, Ctrl+h
```

```Output
Key       Function           Description
---       --------           -----------
Backspace BackwardDeleteChar Delete the character before the cursor
Ctrl+h    BackwardDeleteChar Delete the character before the cursor
```

> [!NOTE]
> The **Chord** parameter is **case-sensitive**. Meaning, you can create different bindings for
> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd>.

On Windows, you can also use the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>?</kbd> key chord to show the function bound to
the next key chord you enter. When you type <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>?</kbd> you see the following
prompt:

```Output
what-is-key:
```

When you hit the <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key you get the following response:

```Output
Backspace: BackwardDeleteChar - Delete the character before the cursor
```

## Key handlers on non-Windows computers

The key codes generated by your keyboard can be different depending on the operating system and
terminal application you are using.

### macOS

The Macintosh keyboard doesn't have an <kbd>Alt</kbd> key like Windows and Linux systems. Instead,
it has the <kbd>&#x2325; Option</kbd> key. macOS uses this key differently than the <kbd>Alt</kbd>
key on other systems. However, you can configure the terminal and iTerm2 applications on macOS to
treat it as an <kbd>Alt</kbd> key.

#### Configuring the Terminal application

Open the **Settings** window from the App bar in Terminal.app. Select **Profiles** and choose the
profile you want to configure. Select the **Keyboard** tab of the configuration options. Below the
list of keys, select the **Use Option as Meta Key** setting. This setting allows the <kbd>&#x2325;
Option</kbd> key to act as <kbd>Alt</kbd> in the Terminal application.

#### Configuring the iTerm2 application

Open the **Settings** window from the App Bar in iTerm.app. Select **Profiles** and choose the
profile you want to configure. Select the **Keys** tab of the configuration options. Select the
**Esc+** option for both the **Left Option Key** and **Right Option Key** settings. This setting
allows the <kbd>&#x2325; Option</kbd> key to act as <kbd>Alt</kbd> in the iTerm application.

> [!NOTE]
> The exact steps may vary depending on the versions of macOS and the terminal applications. These
> examples were captured on macOS Ventura 13.2.1 and iTerm2 v3.4.16.

### Linux

On Linux platforms, the key code generated can be different than other systems. For example:

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>[</kbd> is the same as <kbd>Escape</kbd>
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Spacebar</kbd> generates the key codes for <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D2</kbd>. If
  you want to map a function <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Spacebar</kbd> you must use the chord `Ctrl+D2`.

  ```powershell
  Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Chord 'Ctrl+D2' -Function MenuComplete
  ```

Use the `ReadKey()` method to verify the key codes generated by your keyboard.

## Commonly used key handlers

Here are a few commonly used key handlers that are bound by default on Windows. Note that the key
binding may be different on non-Windows platforms.

### MenuComplete

Complete the input by selecting from a menu of possible completion values.

Default chord: `Ctrl+Spacebar`

The following example shows the menu of possible completions for commands beginning with `select`.

```Output
PS C:\> select<Ctrl+Spacebar>
select                   Select-Object            Select-PSFPropertyValue  Select-Xml
Select-AzContext         Select-PSFConfig         Select-PSMDBuildProject
Select-AzSubscription    Select-PSFObject         Select-String

Select-Object
```

Use the arrow keys to select the completion you want. Press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to complete the
input. As you move through the selections, help for the selected command is displayed below the
menu.

### ClearScreen

This function clears the screen similar to the `cls` or `clear` commands.

Default chord: `Ctrl+l`

### SelectCommandArgument

Selects the next argument on the command line.

Default chord: `Alt+a`

You may have command in your history that you want to run again with different parameter values. You
can use the chord to cycle through each parameter and change the value as needed.

`New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName myRGName -Location eastus -Name myVM`

Pressing <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> selects the next parameter argument in turn: `myRGName`,
`eastus`, `myVM`.

### GotoBrace

Moves the cursor to the matching brace.

Default chord: `Ctrl+]`

This functions moves your cursor to the closing brace that matches the brace at the current cursor
position on the command line. The function works for brackets (`[]`), braces (`{}`), and
parentheses, (`()`).

### DigitArgument

Start or accumulate a numeric argument use to repeat a keystroke the specified number of times.

Default chord: `Alt+0` through `Alt+9`

For example, typing <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd>+<kbd>#</kbd> enters `####` on the command line.
