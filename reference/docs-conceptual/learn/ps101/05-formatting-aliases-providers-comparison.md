# Chapter 5 - Formatting, aliases, providers, comparison

## Requirements

The SQL Server PowerShell module is required by some of the examples shown in this chapter. The
module installs as part of [SQL Server Management Studio (SMSS)][SMSS]. It's also used in
subsequent chapters. Download and install it on your Windows 10 lab environment computer.

## Format Right

In Chapter 4, you learned to filter as far to the left as possible. The rule for manually formatting
a command's output is similar to that rule except it needs to occur as far to the right as possible.

The most common format commands are `Format-Table` and `Format-List`. `Format-Wide` and
`Format-Custom` can also be used, but are less common.

As mentioned in Chapter 3, a command that returns more than four properties defaults to a list
unless custom formatting is used.

```powershell
Get-Service -Name w32time | Select-Object -Property Status, DisplayName, Can*
```

```Output
Status              : Running
DisplayName         : Windows Time
CanPauseAndContinue : False
CanShutdown         : True
CanStop             : True
```

Use the `Format-Table` cmdlet to manually override the formatting and show the output in a table
instead of a list.

```powershell
Get-Service -Name w32time | Select-Object -Property Status, DisplayName, Can* |
Format-Table
```

```Output
 Status DisplayName  CanPauseAndContinue CanShutdown CanStop
 ------ -----------  ------------------- ----------- -------
Running Windows Time               False        True    True
```

The default output for `Get-Service` is three properties in a table.

```powershell
Get-Service -Name w32time
```

```Output
Status   Name               DisplayName
------   ----               -----------
Running  w32time            Windows Time
```

Use the `Format-List` cmdlet to override the default formatting and return the results in a list.

```powershell
Get-Service -Name w32time | Format-List
```

```Output
Name                : w32time
DisplayName         : Windows Time
Status              : Running
DependentServices   : {}
ServicesDependedOn  : {}
CanPauseAndContinue : False
CanShutdown         : True
CanStop             : True
ServiceType         : Win32ShareProcess
```

Notice that simply piping `Get-Service` to `Format-List` made it return additional properties. This
doesn't occur with every command because of the way the formatting for that particular command is
set up behind the scenes.

The number one thing to be aware of with the format cmdlets is they produce format objects that are
different than normal objects in PowerShell.

```powershell
Get-Service -Name w32time | Format-List | Get-Member
```

```

What this means is format commands can't be piped to most other commands. They can be piped to some
of the `Out-*` commands, but that's about it. This is why you want to perform any formatting at the
very end of the line (format right).

## Aliases

An alias in PowerShell is a shorter name for a command. PowerShell includes a set of built-in
aliases and you can also define your own aliases.

The `Get-Alias` cmdlet is used to find aliases. If you already know the alias for a command, the
**Name** parameter is used to determine what command the alias is associated with.

```powershell
Get-Alias -Name gcm
```

```Output
CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
Alias           gcm -> Get-Command
```

Multiple aliases can be specified for the value of the **Name** parameter.

```powershell
Get-Alias -Name gcm, gm
```

```Output
CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
Alias           gcm -> Get-Command
Alias           gm -> Get-Member
```

You'll often see the **Name** parameter omitted since it's a positional parameter.

```powershell
Get-Alias gm
```

```Output
CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
Alias           gm -> Get-Member
```

If you want to find aliases for a command, you'll need to use the **Definition** parameter.

```powershell
Get-Alias -Definition Get-Command, Get-Member
```

```Output
CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
Alias           gcm -> Get-Command
Alias           gm -> Get-Member
```

The **Definition** parameter can't be used positionally so it must be specified.

Aliases can save you a few keystrokes and they're fine when you're typing commands into the console.
They shouldn't be used in scripts or any code that you're saving or sharing with others. As
mentioned earlier in this book, using full cmdlet and parameter names is self-documenting and easier
to understand.

Use caution when creating your own aliases because they'll only exist in your current PowerShell
session on your computer.

## Providers

A provider in PowerShell is an interface that allows file system like access to a datastore. There
are a number of built-in providers in PowerShell.

```powershell
Get-PSProvider
```

```Output
Name                 Capabilities                       Drives
----                 ------------                       ------
Registry             ShouldProcess, Transactions        {HKLM, HKCU}
Alias                ShouldProcess                      {Alias}
Environment          ShouldProcess                      {Env}
FileSystem           Filter, ShouldProcess, Credentials {C, A, D}
Function             ShouldProcess                      {Function}
Variable             ShouldProcess                      {Variable}
Certificate          ShouldProcess                      {Cert}
WSMan                Credentials                        {WSMan}
```

As you can see in the previous results, there are built-in providers for the registry, aliases,
environment variables, the file system, functions, variables, certificates, and WSMan.

The actual drives that these providers use to expose their datastore can be determined with the
`Get-PSDrive` cmdlet. The `Get-PSDrive` cmdlet not only displays drives exposed by providers, but it
also displays Windows logical drives including drives mapped to network shares.

```powershell
Get-PSDrive
```

```Output
Name           Used (GB)     Free (GB) Provider      Root
----           ---------     --------- --------      ----
A                                      FileSystem    A:\
Alias                                  Alias
C                  14.41        112.10 FileSystem    C:\
Cert                                   Certificate   \
D                                      FileSystem    D:\
Env                                    Environment
Function                               Function
HKCU                                   Registry      HKEY_CURRENT_USER
HKLM                                   Registry      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Variable                               Variable
WSMan                                  WSMan
```

Third-party modules such as the Active Directory PowerShell module and the SQLServer PowerShell
module both add their own PowerShell provider and PSDrive.

Import the Active Directory and SQL Server PowerShell modules.

```powershell
Import-Module -Name ActiveDirectory, SQLServer
```

Check to see if any additional PowerShell providers were added.

```powershell
Get-PSProvider
```

```Output
Name                 Capabilities                       Drives
----                 ------------                       ------
Registry             ShouldProcess, Transactions        {HKLM, HKCU}
Alias                ShouldProcess                      {Alias}
Environment          ShouldProcess                      {Env}
FileSystem           Filter, ShouldProcess, Credentials {C, A, D}
Function             ShouldProcess                      {Function}
Variable             ShouldProcess                      {Variable}
ActiveDirectory      Include, Exclude, Filter, Shoul... {AD}
SqlServer            Credentials                        {SQLSERVER}
```

Notice that in the previous set of results, two new PowerShell providers now exist, one for Active
Directory and another one for SQL Server.

A PSDrive for each of those modules was also added.

```powershell
Get-PSDrive
```

```Output
Name           Used (GB)     Free (GB) Provider      Root
----           ---------     --------- --------      ----

D                                      FileSystem    D:\
Env                                    Environment
Function                               Function
HKCU                                   Registry      HKEY_CURRENT_USER
HKLM                                   Registry      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
SQLSERVER                              SqlServer     SQLSERVER:\
Variable                               Variable
WSMan                                  WSMan
```

PSDrives can be accessed just like a traditional file system.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:\LocalMachine\CA
```

```Output
   PSParentPath: Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\Certificate::LocalMachine\CA

## Comparison Operators

PowerShell contains a number of comparison operators that are used to compare values or find values
that match certain patterns. Table 5-1 contains a list of comparison operators in PowerShell.

|    Operator    |                          Definition                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-eq`          | Equal to                                                     |
| `-ne`          | Not equal to                                                 |
| `-gt`          | Greater than                                                 |
| `-ge`          | Greater than or equal to                                     |
| `-lt`          | Less than                                                    |
| `-le`          | Less than or equal to                                        |
| `-Like`        | Match using the `*` wildcard character                       |
| `-NotLike`     | Does not match using the `*` wildcard character              |
| `-Match`       | Matches the specified regular expression                     |
| `-NotMatch`    | Does not match the specified regular expression              |
| `-Contains`    | Determines if a collection contains a specified value        |
| `-NotContains` | Determines if a collection does not contain a specific value |
| `-In`          | Determines if a specified value is in a collection           |
| `-NotIn`       | Determines if a specified value is not in a collection       |
| `-Replace`     | Replaces the specified value                                 |

All of the operators listed in Table 5-1 are case-insensitive. Place a `c` in front of the operator
listed in Table 5-1 to make it case-sensitive. For example, `-ceq` is the case-sensitive version of
the `-eq` comparison operator.

Proper case "PowerShell" is equal to lower case "powershell" using the equals comparison operator.

```powershell
'PowerShell' -eq 'powershell'
```

```Output
True
```

It's not equal using the case-sensitive version of the equals comparison operator.

```powershell
'PowerShell' -ceq 'powershell'
```

```Output
False
```

The not equal comparison operator reverses the condition.

```powershell
'PowerShell' -ne 'powershell'
```

```Output
False
```

Greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, and less than or equal all work with string or
numeric values.

```powershell
5 -gt 5
```

```Output
False
```

Using greater than or equal to instead of greater than with the previous example returns the
**Boolean** true since five is equal to five.

```powershell
5 -ge 5
```

```Output
True
```

Based on the results from the previous two examples, you can probably guess how both less than and
less than or equal to work.

```powershell
5 -lt 10
```

```Output
True
```

The `-Like` and `-Match` operators can be confusing, even for experienced PowerShell users. `-Like`
is used with wildcard the characters `*` and `?` to perform "like" matches.

```powershell
'PowerShell' -like '*shell'
```

```Output
True
```

`-Match` uses a regular expression to perform the matching.

```powershell
'PowerShell' -match '^*.shell$'
```

```Output
True
```

Use the range operator to store the numbers 1 through 10 in a variable.

```powershell
$Numbers = 1..10
```

```Output
```

Determine if the `$Numbers` variable includes 15.

```powershell
$Numbers -contains 15
```

```Output
False
```

Determine if it includes the number 10.

```powershell
$Numbers -contains 10
```

```Output
True
```

`-NotContains` reverses the logic to see if the `$Numbers` variable doesn't contain a value.

```powershell
$Numbers -notcontains 15
```

```Output
True
```

The previous example returns the **Boolean** true because it's true that the `$Numbers` variable
doesn't contain 15. It does however contain the number 10 so it's false when it's tested.

```powershell
$Numbers -notcontains 10
```

```Output
False
```

The "in" comparison operator was first introduced in PowerShell version 3.0. It's used to determine
if a value is "in" an array. The `$Numbers` variable is an array since it contains multiple values.

```powershell
15 -in $Numbers
```

```Output
False
```

In other words, `-in` performs the same test as the contains comparison operator except from the
opposite direction.

```powershell
10 -in $Numbers
```

```Output
True
```

15 isn't in the `$Numbers` array so false is returned in the following example.

```powershell
15 -in $Numbers
```

```Output
False
```

Just like the `-contains` operator, `not` reverses the logic for the `-in` operator.

```powershell
10 -notin $Numbers
```

```Output
False
```

The previous example returns false because the `$Numbers` array does include 10 and the condition
was testing to determine if it didn't contain 10.

15 is "not in" the `$Numbers` array so it returns the **Boolean** true.

```powershell
15 -notin $Numbers
```

```Output
True
```

The `-replace` operator does just want you would think. It's used to replace something. Specifying
one value replaces that value with nothing. In the following example, I replace "Shell" with nothing.

```powershell
'PowerShell' -replace 'Shell'
```

```Output
Power
```

If you want to replace a value with a different value, specify the new value after the pattern you
want to replace. SQL Saturday in Baton Rouge is an event that I try to speak at every year. In the
following example, I replace the word "Saturday" with the abbreviation "Sat".

```powershell
'SQL Saturday - Baton Rouge' -Replace 'saturday','Sat'
```

```Output
SQL Sat - Baton Rouge
```

There are also methods like **Replace()** that can be used to replace things similar to the way the
replace operator works. However, the `-Replace` operator is case-insensitive by default, and the
**Replace()** method is case-sensitive.

```powershell
'SQL Saturday - Baton Rouge'.Replace('saturday','Sat')
```

```Output
SQL Saturday - Baton Rouge
```

Notice that the word "Saturday" wasn't replaced in the previous example. This is because it was
specified in a different case than the original. When the word "Saturday" is specified in the same
case as the original, the **Replace()** method does replace it as expected.

```powershell
'SQL Saturday - Baton Rouge'.Replace('Saturday','Sat')
```

```Output
SQL Sat - Baton Rouge
```

Be careful when using methods to transform data because you can run into unforeseen problems, such
as failing the _Turkey Test_. For an example, see the blog article titled
[Using Pester to Test PowerShell Code with Other Cultures][]. My recommendation is to use an
operator instead of a method whenever possible to avoid these types of problems.

While the comparison operators can be used as shown in the previous examples, I normally find myself
using them with the `Where-Object` cmdlet to perform some type of filtering.

## Summary

In this chapter, you've learned a number of different topics to include Formatting Right, Aliases,
Providers, and Comparison Operators.

## Review

1. Why is it necessary to perform Formatting as far to the right as possible?
1. How do you determine what the actual cmdlet is for the `%` alias?
1. Why shouldn't you use aliases in scripts you save or code you share with others?
1. Perform a directory listing on the drives that are associated with one of the registry providers.
1. What's one of the main benefits of using the replace operator instead of the replace method?
