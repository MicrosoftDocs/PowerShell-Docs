# Chapter 7 - Working with WMI

## WMI and CIM

PowerShell ships by default with cmdlets for working with other technologies such as Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI). There are several native WMI cmdlets that exist in PowerShell
without having to install any additional software or modules.

PowerShell has had cmdlets for working with WMI since the beginning. `Get-Command` can be used to
determine what WMI cmdlets exist in PowerShell. The following results are from my Windows 10 lab
environment computer that is running PowerShell version 5.1. Your results may differ depending on
what PowerShell version you're running.

```powershell
Get-Command -Noun WMI*
```

```Output
CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source

```

Common Information Model (CIM) cmdlets were introduced in PowerShell version 3.0. The CIM cmdlets
are designed so they can be used on both Windows and non-Windows machines. The WMI cmdlets are
deprecated so my recommendation is to use the CIM cmdlets instead of the older WMI ones.

The CIM cmdlets are all contained within a module. To obtain a list of the CIM cmdlets, use
`Get-Command` with the **Module** parameter as shown in the following example.

```powershell
Get-Command -Module CimCmdlets
```

```Output
CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source

```

The CIM cmdlets still allow you to work with WMI so don't be confused when someone makes the
statement "When I query WMI with the PowerShell CIM cmdlets..."

As I previously mentioned, WMI is a separate technology from PowerShell and you're just using the
CIM cmdlets for accessing WMI. You may find an old VBScript that uses WMI Query Language (WQL) to
query WMI such as in the following example.

```vb
strComputer = "."
Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:" _
    & "{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!\\" & strComputer & "\root\cimv2")

Set colBIOS = objWMIService.ExecQuery _
    ("Select * from Win32_BIOS")

For each objBIOS in colBIOS
    Wscript.Echo "Manufacturer: " & objBIOS.Manufacturer
    Wscript.Echo "Name: " & objBIOS.Name
    Wscript.Echo "Serial Number: " & objBIOS.SerialNumber
    Wscript.Echo "SMBIOS Version: " & objBIOS.SMBIOSBIOSVersion
    Wscript.Echo "Version: " & objBIOS.Version
Next
```

You can take the WQL query from that VBScript and use it with the `Get-CimInstance` cmdlet without
any modifications.

```powershell
Get-CimInstance -Query 'Select * from Win32_BIOS'
```

```Output
SMBIOSBIOSVersion : 090006
Manufacturer      : American Megatrends Inc.
Name              : Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1505M v5 @ 2.80GHz
SerialNumber      : 3810-1995-1654-4615-2295-2755-89
Version           : VRTUAL - 4001628
```

That's not how I typically query WMI with PowerShell. But it does work and allows you to easily
migrate existing VBScripts to PowerShell. When I start out writing a one-liner to query WMI, I use
the following syntax.

```powershell
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_BIOS
```

```Output
SMBIOSBIOSVersion : 090006
Manufacturer      : American Megatrends Inc.
Name              : Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1505M v5 @ 2.80GHz
SerialNumber      : 3810-1995-1654-4615-2295-2755-89
Version           : VRTUAL - 4001628
```

If I only want the serial number, I can pipe the output to `Select-Object` and specify only the
**SerialNumber** property.

```powershell
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_BIOS | Select-Object -Property SerialNumber
```

```Output
SerialNumber
------------
3810-1995-1654-4615-2295-2755-89
```

By default, there are several properties that are retrieved behind the scenes that are never used.
It may not matter much when querying WMI on the local computer. But once you start querying remote
computers, it's not only additional processing time to return that information, but also additional
unnecessary information to have to pull across the network. `Get-CimInstance` has a **Property**
parameter that limits the information that's retrieved. This makes the query to WMI more efficient.

```powershell
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_BIOS -Property SerialNumber |
Select-Object -Property SerialNumber
```

```Output
SerialNumber
------------
3810-1995-1654-4615-2295-2755-89
```

The previous results returned an object. To return a simple string, use the **ExpandProperty**
parameter.

```powershell
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_BIOS -Property SerialNumber |
Select-Object -ExpandProperty SerialNumber
```

```Output
3810-1995-1654-4615-2295-2755-89
```

You could also use the dotted style of syntax to return a simple string. This eliminates the need to
pipe to `Select-Object`.

```powershell
(Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_BIOS -Property SerialNumber).SerialNumber
```

```Output
3810-1995-1654-4615-2295-2755-89
```

## Query Remote Computers with the CIM cmdlets

I'm still running PowerShell as a local admin who is a domain user. When I try to query information
from a remote computer using the `Get-CimInstance` cmdlet, I receive an access denied error message.

```powershell
Get-CimInstance -ComputerName dc01 -ClassName Win32_BIOS
```

```Output
Get-CimInstance : Access is denied.
At line:1 char:1
+ Get-CimInstance -ComputerName dc01 -ClassName Win32_BIOS
+ ``````````````````````````````````````````````````````~~
    + CategoryInfo          : PermissionDenied: (root\cimv2:Win32_BIOS:String) [Get-CimI
   nstance], CimException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : HRESULT 0x80070005,Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.Cim
   Cmdlets.GetCimInstanceCommand
    + PSComputerName        : dc01
```

Many people have security concerns when it comes to PowerShell, but the truth is you have exactly
the same permissions in PowerShell as you do in the GUI. No more and no less. The problem in the
previous example is that the user running PowerShell doesn't have rights to query WMI information
from the DC01 server. I could relaunch PowerShell as a domain administrator since `Get-CimInstance`
doesn't have a **Credential** parameter. But, trust me, that isn't a good idea because then anything
that I run from PowerShell would be running as a domain admin. That could be dangerous from a
security standpoint depending on the situation.

Using the principle of least privilege, I elevate to my domain admin account on a per command basis
using the **Credential** parameter, if a command has one. `Get-CimInstance` doesn't have a
**Credential** parameter so the solution in this scenario is to create a **CimSession** first. Then
I use the **CimSession** instead of a computer name to query WMI on the remote computer.

```powershell
$CimSession = New-CimSession -ComputerName dc01 -Credential (Get-Credential)
```

```Output
cmdlet Get-Credential at command pipeline position 1
Supply values for the following parameters:
Credential
```

The CIM session was stored in a variable named `$CimSession`. Notice that I also specified the
`Get-Credential` cmdlet in parentheses so that it executes first, prompting me for alternate
credentials, before creating the new session. I'll show you another more efficient way to specify
alternate credentials later in this chapter, but it's important to understand this basic concept
before making it more complicated.

The CIM session created in the previous example can now be used with the `Get-CimInstance` cmdlet to
query the BIOS information from WMI on the remote computer.

```powershell
Get-CimInstance -CimSession $CimSession -ClassName Win32_BIOS
```

```Output
SMBIOSBIOSVersion : 090006
Manufacturer      : American Megatrends Inc.
Name              : Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1505M v5 @ 2.80GHz
SerialNumber      : 0986-6980-3916-0512-6608-8243-13
Version           : VRTUAL - 4001628
PSComputerName    : dc01
```

There are several additional benefits to using CIM sessions instead of just specifying a computer
name. When running multiple queries to the same computer, using a CIM session is more efficient than
using the computer name for each query. Creating a CIM session only sets up the connection once.
Then, multiple queries use that same session to retrieve information. Using the computer name
requires the cmdlets to set up and tear down the connection with each individual query.

The `Get-CimInstance` cmdlet uses the WSMan protocol by default, which means the remote computer
needs PowerShell version 3.0 or higher to connect. It's actually not the PowerShell version that
matters, it's the stack version. The stack version can be determined using the `Test-WSMan` cmdlet.
It needs to be version 3.0. That's the version you'll find with PowerShell version 3.0 and higher.

```powershell
Test-WSMan -ComputerName dc01
```

```Output
wsmid           : http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wsman/identity/1/wsmanidentity.xsd
ProtocolVersion : http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wsman/1/wsman.xsd
ProductVendor   : Microsoft Corporation
ProductVersion  : OS: 0.0.0 SP: 0.0 Stack: 3.0
```

The older WMI cmdlets use the DCOM protocol, which is compatible with older versions of Windows. But
DCOM is typically blocked by the firewall on newer versions of Windows. The `New-CimSessionOption`
cmdlet allows you to create a DCOM protocol connection for use with `New-CimSession`. This allows
the `Get-CimInstance` cmdlet to be used to communicate with versions of Windows as old as Windows
Server 2000. This also means that PowerShell is not required on the remote computer when using the
`Get-CimInstance` cmdlet with a CimSession that's configured to use the DCOM protocol.

Create the DCOM protocol option using the `New-CimSessionOption` cmdlet and store it in a variable.

```powershell
$DCOM = New-CimSessionOption -Protocol Dcom
```

For efficiency, you can store your domain administrator or elevated credentials in a variable so you
don't have to constantly enter them for each command.

```powershell
$Cred = Get-Credential
```

```Output
cmdlet Get-Credential at command pipeline position 1
Supply values for the following parameters:
Credential
```

I have a server named SQL03 that runs Windows Server 2008 (non-R2). It's the newest Windows Server
operating system that doesn't have PowerShell installed by default.

Create a **CimSession** to SQL03 using the DCOM protocol.

```powershell
$CimSession = New-CimSession -ComputerName sql03 -SessionOption $DCOM -Credential $Cred
```

Notice in the previous command, this time I specified the variable named `$Cred` as the value for
the **Credential** parameter instead of having to enter them manually again.

The output of the query is the same regardless of the underlying protocol being used.

```powershell
Get-CimInstance -CimSession $CimSession -ClassName Win32_BIOS
```

```Output
SMBIOSBIOSVersion : 090006
Manufacturer      : American Megatrends Inc.
Name              : Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1505M v5 @ 2.80GHz
SerialNumber      : 7237-7483-8873-8926-7271-5004-86
Version           : VRTUAL - 4001628
PSComputerName    : sql03
```

The `Get-CimSession` cmdlet is used to see what **CimSessions** are currently connected and what
protocols they're using.

```powershell
Get-CimSession
```

```Output
Id           : 1
Name         : CimSession1
InstanceId   : 80742787-e38e-41b1-a7d7-fa1369cf1402
ComputerName : dc01
Protocol     : WSMAN

Id           : 2
Name         : CimSession2
InstanceId   : 8fcabd81-43cf-4682-bd53-ccce1e24aecb
ComputerName : sql03
Protocol     : DCOM
```

Retrieve and store both of the previously created **CimSessions** in a variable named `$CimSession`.

```powershell
$CimSession = Get-CimSession
```

Query both of the computers with one command, one using the WSMan protocol and the other one with
DCOM.

```powershell
Get-CimInstance -CimSession $CimSession -ClassName Win32_BIOS
```

```Output
SMBIOSBIOSVersion : 090006
Manufacturer      : American Megatrends Inc.
Name              : Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1505M v5 @ 2.80GHz
SerialNumber      : 0986-6980-3916-0512-6608-8243-13
Version           : VRTUAL - 4001628
PSComputerName    : dc01

SMBIOSBIOSVersion : 090006
Manufacturer      : American Megatrends Inc.
Name              : Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1505M v5 @ 2.80GHz
SerialNumber      : 7237-7483-8873-8926-7271-5004-86
Version           : VRTUAL - 4001628
PSComputerName    : sql03
```

I've written numerous blog articles about the WMI and CIM cmdlets. One of the most useful ones is
about a function that I created to automatically determine if WSMan or DCOM should be used and set
up the CIM session automatically without having to figure out which one manually. That blog article
is titled [PowerShell Function to Create CimSessions to Remote Computers with Fallback to Dcom][].

When you're finished with the CIM sessions, you should remove them with the `Remove-CimSession`
cmdlet. To remove all CIM sessions, simply pipe `Get-CimSession` to `Remove-CimSession`.

```powershell
Get-CimSession | Remove-CimSession
```

## Summary
