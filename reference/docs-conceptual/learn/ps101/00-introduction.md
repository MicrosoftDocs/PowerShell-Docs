## Who is this book for?

This is an entry-level book for anyone wanting to learn PowerShell.

This book focuses on PowerShell version 5.1 running on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 in a
Microsoft Active Directory domain environment. However, the basic concepts apply to all versions of
PowerShell running on any supported platform.

## About this book

This book is a collection of what I wish someone would have told me when I started learning
PowerShell, along with the tips, tricks, and best practices that I've learned while using PowerShell
during the past 10 years.

Instead of providing an enormous amount of information, this book attempts to provide a balance of
enough information to be successful for someone who is just getting started with PowerShell. Each
chapter contains links to specific help topics for those who want more information about the topics
covered in that chapter.

## About the author

Mike F Robbins is a former Microsoft MVP, co-author of _Windows PowerShell TFM 4th Edition_, and a
contributing author in the _PowerShell Deep Dives_ book. Mike has been a strong supporter of the
PowerShell community and is now the lead writer for [Azure PowerShell][] at Microsoft. He blogs at
[mikefrobbins.com][] and can be found on twitter [@mikefrobbins][].

## Lab environment

The examples in this book were designed and tested on Windows 10 Anniversary Edition (build 1607)
and Windows Server 2016 using PowerShell version 5.1. If you're using a different version of
PowerShell or operating system, your results may differ from those shown here.
