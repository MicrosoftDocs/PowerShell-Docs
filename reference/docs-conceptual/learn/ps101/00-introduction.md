## About this book

Before PowerShell, I began my career as an IT Pro, pointing and clicking in the GUI. I wrote this
book to save IT Pros from themselves by reducing the learning curve and helping them avoid being
reluctant to learn PowerShell.

Instead of a book that covers topics with fictitious scenarios, this book is a condensed version
targeting the specific topics I've found an IT Pro needs to know to succeed with PowerShell in a
real-world production environment. It's a collection of what I wish someone would have told me when
I started learning PowerShell, along with the tips, tricks, and best practices that I've learned
while using PowerShell since 2007.

In every chapter, you'll find a curated collection of links to specific help topics if you want to
know more about the information covered in that chapter. These resources help you dive deeper into
the topics discussed in the book and broaden your understanding of PowerShell.

## Who is this book for?

This book is for anyone wanting to learn PowerShell. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced
user, this book will help you improve your PowerShell skills.

This book focuses on Windows PowerShell version 5.1 running on Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 in
a Microsoft Active Directory domain environment. However, the basic concepts apply to all versions
of PowerShell running on any supported platform.
