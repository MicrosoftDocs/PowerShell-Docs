# Getting information about commands

The PowerShell `Get-Command` displays commands that are available in your current session.
When you run the `Get-Command` cmdlet, you see something similar to the following output:

```output
CommandType     Name                    Version    Source
-----------     ----                    -------    ------
Cmdlet          Add-Computer            3.1.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
Cmdlet          Add-Content             3.1.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
Cmdlet          Add-History             3.0.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Core
Cmdlet          Add-JobTrigger          1.1.0.0    PSScheduledJob
Cmdlet          Add-LocalGroupMember    1.0.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.LocalAccounts
Cmdlet          Add-Member              3.1.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
Cmdlet          Add-PSSnapin            3.0.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Core
Cmdlet          Add-Type                3.1.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
...
```

This output looks a lot like the Help output of **cmd.exe**: a tabular summary of internal commands. In
the excerpt of the `Get-Command` command output shown above, every command shown has a CommandType
of Cmdlet. A cmdlet is PowerShell's intrinsic command type. This type corresponds roughly to
commands like `dir` and `cd` in **cmd.exe** or the built-in commands of Unix shells like bash.

The `Get-Command` cmdlet has a **Syntax** parameter that returns syntax of each cmdlet. The
following example shows how to get the syntax of the `Get-Help` cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-Command Get-Help -Syntax
```

```output
Get-Help [[-Name] <String>] [-Path <String>] [-Category <String[]>] [-Component <String[]>] [-Functionality <String[]>]
 [-Role <String[]>] [-Full] [-Online] [-Verbose] [-Debug] [-ErrorAction <ActionPreference>] [-WarningAction <ActionPreference>] [-ErrorVariable <String>] [-WarningVariable <String>] [-OutVariable <String>] [-OutBuffer <Int32>]

Get-Help [[-Name] <String>] [-Path <String>] [-Category <String[]>] [-Component <String[]>] [-Functionality <String[]>]
 [-Role <String[]>] [-Detailed] [-Online] [-Verbose] [-Debug] [-ErrorAction <ActionPreference>] [-WarningAction <ActionPreference>] [-ErrorVariable <String>] [-WarningVariable <String>] [-OutVariable <String>] [-OutBuffer <Int32>]

Get-Help [[-Name] <String>] [-Path <String>] [-Category <String[]>] [-Component <String[]>] [-Functionality <String[]>]
 [-Role <String[]>] [-Examples] [-Online] [-Verbose] [-Debug] [-ErrorAction <ActionPreference>] [-WarningAction <ActionPreference>] [-ErrorVariable <String>] [-WarningVariable <String>] [-OutVariable <String>] [-OutBuffer <Int32>]

Get-Help [[-Name] <String>] [-Path <String>] [-Category <String[]>] [-Component <String[]>] [-Functionality <String[]>]
 [-Role <String[]>] [-Parameter <String>] [-Online] [-Verbose] [-Debug] [-ErrorAction <ActionPreference>] [-WarningAction <ActionPreference>] [-ErrorVariable <String>] [-WarningVariable <String>] [-OutVariable <String>] [-OutBuffer <Int32>]
```

## Displaying available command by type

The `Get-Command` command lists only the cmdlets in the current session. PowerShell actually
supports several other types of commands:

- Aliases
- Functions
- Scripts

External executable files, or files that have a registered file type handler, are also classified as
commands.

To get all commands in the session, type:

```powershell
Get-Command *
```

This list includes external commands in your search path so it can contain thousands of items.
It is more useful to look at a reduced set of commands.

> [!NOTE]
> The asterisk (\*) is used for wildcard matching in PowerShell command arguments. The \* means
> "match one or more of any characters". You can type `Get-Command a*` to find all commands that
> begin with the letter "a". Unlike wildcard matching in **cmd.exe**, PowerShell's wildcard will also
> match a period.

Use the **CommandType** parameter of `Get-Command` to get native commands of other types.
cmdlet.

To get command aliases, which are the assigned nicknames of commands, type:

```powershell
Get-Command -CommandType Alias
```

To get the functions in the current session, type:

```powershell
Get-Command -CommandType Function
```

To display scripts in PowerShell's search path, type:

```powershell
Get-Command -CommandType Script
```
