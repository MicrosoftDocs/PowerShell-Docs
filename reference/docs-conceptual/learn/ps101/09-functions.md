# Chapter 9 - Functions

If you're writing PowerShell one-liners or scripts and find yourself often having to modify them for
different scenarios, there's a good chance that it's a good candidate to be turned into a function
that can be reused.

Whenever possible, I prefer to write functions because they are more tool oriented. I can put the
functions in a script module, put that module in the `$env:PSModulePath`, and call the functions
without needing to physically locate where they're saved. Using the PowerShellGet module, it's easy
to share those modules in a NuGet repository. PowerShellGet ships with PowerShell version 5.0 and
higher. It is available as a separate download for PowerShell version 3.0 and higher.

Don't over complicate things. Keep it simple and use the most straight forward way to accomplish a
task. Avoid aliases and positional parameters in any code that you reuse. Format your code for
readability. Don't hardcode values; use parameters and variables. Don't write unnecessary code even
if it doesn't hurt anything. It adds unnecessary complexity. Attention to detail goes a long
way when writing any PowerShell code.

## Naming

When naming your functions in PowerShell, use a [Pascal case][] name with an approved verb and a
singular noun. I also recommend prefixing the noun. For example:
`<ApprovedVerb>-<Prefix><SingularNoun>`.

In PowerShell, there's a specific list of approved verbs that can be obtained by running `Get-Verb`.

```powershell
Get-Verb | Sort-Object -Property Verb
```

```Output

```

In the previous example, I've sorted the results by the **Verb** column. The **Group** column gives
you an idea of how these verbs are used. It's important to choose an approved verb in PowerShell
when functions are added to a module. The module generates a warning message at load time if you
choose an unapproved verb. That warning message makes your functions look unprofessional. Unapproved
verbs also limit the discoverability of your functions.

## A simple function

A function in PowerShell is declared with the function keyword followed by the function name and
then an open and closing curly brace. The code that the function will execute is contained within
those curly braces.

```powershell
function Get-Version {
    $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
}
```

The function shown is a simple example that returns the version of PowerShell.

```powershell
Get-Version
```

```Output
Major  Minor  Build  Revision
-----  -----  -----  --------
5      1      14393  693
```

There's a good chance of name conflict with functions named something like `Get-Version` and default
commands in PowerShell or commands that others may write. This is why I recommend prefixing the noun
portion of your functions to help prevent naming conflicts. In the following example, I'll use the
prefix "PS".

```powershell
function Get-PSVersion {
    $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
}
```

Other than the name, this function is identical to the previous one.

```powershell
Get-PSVersion
```

```Output
Major  Minor  Build  Revision
-----  -----  -----  --------
5      1      14393  693
```

Even when prefixing the noun with something like PS, there's still a good chance of having a name
conflict. I typically prefix my function nouns with my initials. Develop a standard and stick to it.

```powershell
function Get-MrPSVersion {
    $PSVersionTable.PSVersion
}
```

This function is no different than the previous two other than using a more sensible name to try to
prevent naming conflicts with other PowerShell commands.

```powershell
Get-MrPSVersion
```

```Output
Major  Minor  Build  Revision
-----  -----  -----  --------
5      1      14393  693
```

Once loaded into memory, you can see functions on the **Function** PSDrive.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path Function:\Get-*Version
```

```Output
CommandType     Name                                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                                               -------    ------
Function        Get-Version
Function        Get-PSVersion
Function        Get-MrPSVersion
```

If you want to remove these functions from your current session, you'll have to remove them from the
**Function** PSDrive or close and reopen PowerShell.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path Function:\Get-*Version | Remove-Item
```

Verify that the functions were indeed removed.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path Function:\Get-*Version
```

If the functions were loaded as part of a module, the module can be unloaded to remove them.

```powershell
Remove-Module -Name <ModuleName>
```

The `Remove-Module` cmdlet removes modules from memory in your current PowerShell session, it
doesn't remove them from your system or from disk.

## Parameters

Don't statically assign values! Use parameters and variables. When it comes to naming your
parameters, use the same name as the default cmdlets for your parameter names whenever possible.

```powershell
function Test-MrParameter {

    param (
        $ComputerName
    )

    Write-Output $ComputerName

}
```

Why did I use **ComputerName** and not **Computer**, **ServerName**, or **Host** for my parameter
name? It's because I wanted my function standardized like the default cmdlets.

I'll create a function to query all of the commands on a system and return the number of them that
have specific parameter names.

```powershell
function Get-MrParameterCount {
    param (
        [string[]]$ParameterName
    )

    foreach ($Parameter in $ParameterName) {
        $Results = Get-Command -ParameterName $Parameter -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

        [pscustomobject]@{
            ParameterName = $Parameter
            NumberOfCmdlets = $Results.Count
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see in the results shown below, 39 commands that have a **ComputerName** parameter. There
aren't any cmdlets that have parameters such as **Computer**, **ServerName**, **Host**, or
**Machine**.

```powershell
Get-MrParameterCount -ParameterName ComputerName, Computer, ServerName, Host, Machine
```

```Output
ParameterName NumberOfCmdlets
------------- ---------------
ComputerName               39
Computer                    0
ServerName                  0
Host                        0
Machine                     0
```

I also recommend using the same case for your parameter names as the default cmdlets. Use
`ComputerName`, not `computername`. This makes your functions look and feel like the default
cmdlets. People who are already familiar with PowerShell will feel right at home.

## Advanced Functions

Turning a function in PowerShell into an advanced function is really simple. One of the differences
between a function and an advanced function is that advanced functions have a number of common
parameters that are added to the function automatically. These common parameters include parameters
such as **Verbose** and **Debug**.

I'll start out with the `Test-MrParameter` function that was used in the previous section.

```powershell
function Test-MrParameter {

    param (
        $ComputerName
    )

    Write-Output $ComputerName

}
```

What I want you to notice is that the `Test-MrParameter` function doesn't have any common
parameters. There are a couple of different ways to see the common parameters. One is by viewing the
syntax using `Get-Command`.

```powershell
Get-Command -Name Test-MrParameter -Syntax
```

```Output
Test-MrParameter [[-ComputerName] <Object>]
```

Another is to drill down into the parameters with `Get-Command`.

```powershell
(Get-Command -Name Test-MrParameter).Parameters.Keys
```

```Output
ComputerName
```

Add `CmdletBinding` to turn the function into an advanced function.

```powershell
function Test-MrCmdletBinding {

    [CmdletBinding()] #<<-- This turns a regular function into an advanced function
    param (
        $ComputerName
    )

    Write-Output $ComputerName

}
```

Adding `CmdletBinding` adds the common parameters automatically. `CmdletBinding` requires a `param`
block, but the `param` block can be empty.

```powershell
Get-Command -Name Test-MrCmdletBinding -Syntax
```

```Output
Test-MrCmdletBinding [[-ComputerName] <Object>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

Drilling down into the parameters with `Get-Command` shows the actual parameter names including the
common ones.

```powershell
(Get-Command -Name Test-MrCmdletBinding).Parameters.Keys
```

```Output
ComputerName
Verbose
Debug
ErrorAction
WarningAction
InformationAction
ErrorVariable
WarningVariable
InformationVariable
OutVariable
OutBuffer
PipelineVariable
```

## SupportsShouldProcess

`SupportsShouldProcess` adds **WhatIf** and **Confirm** parameters. These are only needed for
commands that make changes.

```powershell
function Test-MrSupportsShouldProcess {

    [CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess)]
    param (
        $ComputerName
    )

    Write-Output $ComputerName

}
```

Notice that there are now **WhatIf** and **Confirm** parameters.

```powershell
Get-Command -Name Test-MrSupportsShouldProcess -Syntax
```

```Output
Test-MrSupportsShouldProcess [[-ComputerName] <Object>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

Once again, you can also use `Get-Command` to return a list of the actual parameter names including
the common ones along with WhatIf and Confirm.

```powershell
(Get-Command -Name Test-MrSupportsShouldProcess).Parameters.Keys
```

```Output
ComputerName
Verbose
Debug
ErrorAction
WarningAction
InformationAction
ErrorVariable
WarningVariable
InformationVariable
OutVariable
OutBuffer
PipelineVariable
WhatIf
Confirm
```

## Parameter Validation

Validate input early on. Why allow your code to continue on a path when it's not possible to
run without valid input?

Always type the variables that are being used for your parameters (specify a datatype).

```powershell
function Test-MrParameterValidation {

    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [string]$ComputerName
    )

    Write-Output $ComputerName

}
```

In the previous example, I've specified **String** as the datatype for the **ComputerName**
parameter. This causes it to allow only a single computer name to be specified. If more than one
computer name is specified via a comma-separated list, an error is generated.

```powershell
Test-MrParameterValidation -ComputerName Server01, Server02
```

```Output
Test-MrParameterValidation : Cannot process argument transformation on parameter
'ComputerName'. Cannot convert value to type System.String.
At line:1 char:42
+ Test-MrParameterValidation -ComputerName Server01, Server02
+
    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidData: (:) [Test-MrParameterValidation], ParameterBindingArg
     umentTransformationException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : ParameterArgumentTransformationError,Test-MrParameterValidation
```

The problem with the current definition is that it's valid to omit the value of the **ComputerName**
parameter, but a value is required for the function to complete successfully. This is where the
`Mandatory` parameter attribute comes in handy.

```powershell
function Test-MrParameterValidation {

    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string]$ComputerName
    )

    Write-Output $ComputerName

}
```

The syntax used in the previous example is PowerShell version 3.0 and higher compatible.
`[Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]` could be specified instead to make the function compatible with
PowerShell version 2.0 and higher. Now that the **ComputerName** is required, if one isn't
specified, the function will prompt for one.

```powershell
Test-MrParameterValidation
```

```Output
cmdlet Test-MrParameterValidation at command pipeline position 1
Supply values for the following parameters:
ComputerName:
```

If you want to allow for more than one value for the **ComputerName** parameter, use the **String**
datatype but add open and closed square brackets to the datatype to allow for an array of strings.

```powershell
function Test-MrParameterValidation {

    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [string[]]$ComputerName
    )

    Write-Output $ComputerName

}
```

Maybe you want to specify a default value for the **ComputerName** parameter if one isn't specified.
The problem is that default values can't be used with mandatory parameters. Instead, you'll need to
use the `ValidateNotNullOrEmpty` parameter validation attribute with a default value.

```powershell
function Test-MrParameterValidation {

    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [string[]]$ComputerName = $env:COMPUTERNAME
    )

    Write-Output $ComputerName

}
```

Even when setting a default value, try not to use static values. In the previous example,
`$env:COMPUTERNAME` is used as the default value, which is automatically translated into the local
computer name if a value is not provided.

## Verbose Output

While inline comments are useful, especially if you're writing some complex code, they never get
seen by users unless they look into the code itself.

The function shown in the following example has an inline comment in the `foreach` loop. While this
particular comment may not be that difficult to locate, imagine if the function included hundreds of
lines of code.

```powershell
function Test-MrVerboseOutput {

    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [string[]]$ComputerName = $env:COMPUTERNAME
    )

    foreach ($Computer in $ComputerName) {
        #Attempting to perform some action on $Computer <<-- Don't use
        #inline comments like this, use write verbose instead.
        Write-Output $Computer
    }

}
```

A better option is to use `Write-Verbose` instead of inline comments.

```powershell
function Test-MrVerboseOutput {

    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [string[]]$ComputerName = $env:COMPUTERNAME
    )

    foreach ($Computer in $ComputerName) {
        Write-Verbose -Message "Attempting to perform some action on $Computer"
        Write-Output $Computer
    }

}
```

When the function is called without the **Verbose** parameter, the verbose output won't be
displayed.

```powershell
Test-MrVerboseOutput -ComputerName Server01, Server02
```

When it's called with the **Verbose** parameter, the verbose output will be displayed.

```powershell
Test-MrVerboseOutput -ComputerName Server01, Server02 -Verbose
```

## Pipeline Input

When you want your function to accept pipeline input, some additional coding is necessary. As
mentioned earlier in this book, commands can accept pipeline input **by value** (by type) or **by
property name**. You can write your functions just like the native commands so that they accept
either one or both of these types of input.

To accept pipeline input **by value**, specified the `ValueFromPipeline` parameter attribute for
that particular parameter. Keep in mind that you can only accept pipeline input **by value** from
one of each datatype. For example, if you have two parameters that accept string input, only one of
those can accept pipeline input **by value** because if you specified it for both of the string
parameters, the pipeline input wouldn't know which one to bind to. This is another reason I call
this type of pipeline input _by type_ instead of **by value**.

Pipeline input comes in one item at a time similar to the way items are handled in a `foreach` loop.
At a minimum, a `process` block is required to process each of these items if you're accepting an
array as input. If you're only accepting a single value as input, a `process` block isn't necessary,
but I still recommend specifying it for consistency.

```powershell
function Test-MrPipelineInput {

    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory,
                   ValueFromPipeline)]
        [string[]]$ComputerName
    )

    PROCESS {
        Write-Output $ComputerName
    }

}
```

Accepting pipeline input **by property name** is similar except it's specified with the
`ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName` parameter attribute and it can be specified for any number of
parameters regardless of datatype. The key is that the output of the command that's being piped in
has to have a property name that matches the name of the parameter or a parameter alias of your
function.

```powershell
function Test-MrPipelineInput {

    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory,
                   ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName)]
        [string[]]$ComputerName
    )

    PROCESS {
            Write-Output $ComputerName
    }

}
```

`BEGIN` and `END` blocks are optional. `BEGIN` would be specified before the `PROCESS` block and is
used to perform any initial work prior to the items being received from the pipeline. This is
important to understand. Values that are piped in are not accessible in the `BEGIN` block. The `END`
block would be specified after the `PROCESS` block and is used for cleanup once all of the items
that are piped in have been processed.

## Error Handling

The function shown in the following example generates an unhandled exception when a computer can't
be contacted.

```powershell
function Test-MrErrorHandling {

    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory,
                   ValueFromPipeline,
                   ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName)]
        [string[]]$ComputerName
    )

    PROCESS {
        foreach ($Computer in $ComputerName) {
            Test-WSMan -ComputerName $Computer
        }
    }

}
```

There are a couple of different ways to handle errors in PowerShell. `Try/Catch` is the more modern
way to handle errors.

```powershell
function Test-MrErrorHandling {

    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory,
                   ValueFromPipeline,
                   ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName)]
        [string[]]$ComputerName
    )

    PROCESS {
        foreach ($Computer in $ComputerName) {
            try {
                Test-WSMan -ComputerName $Computer
            }
            catch {
                Write-Warning -Message "Unable to connect to Computer: $Computer"
            }
        }
    }

}
```

Although the function shown in the previous example uses error handling, it also generates an
unhandled exception because the command doesn't generate a terminating error. This is also important
to understand. Only terminating errors are caught. Specify the **ErrorAction** parameter with
**Stop** as the value to turn a non-terminating error into a terminating one.

```powershell
function Test-MrErrorHandling {

    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory,
                   ValueFromPipeline,
                   ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName)]
        [string[]]$ComputerName
    )

    PROCESS {
        foreach ($Computer in $ComputerName) {
            try {
                Test-WSMan -ComputerName $Computer -ErrorAction Stop
            }
            catch {
                Write-Warning -Message "Unable to connect to Computer: $Computer"
            }
        }
    }

}
```

Don't modify the global `$ErrorActionPreference` variable unless absolutely necessary. If you're
using something like .NET directly from within your PowerShell function, you can't specify the
**ErrorAction** on the command itself. In that scenario, you might need to change the global
`$ErrorActionPreference` variable, but if you do change it, change it back immediately after trying
the command.

## Comment-Based Help

It's considered to be a best practice to add comment based help to your functions so the people
you're sharing them with will know how to use them.

```powershell
function Get-MrAutoStoppedService {

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Returns a list of services that are set to start automatically, are not
    currently running, excluding the services that are set to delayed start.

.DESCRIPTION
    Get-MrAutoStoppedService is a function that returns a list of services from
    the specified remote computer(s) that are set to start automatically, are not
    currently running, and it excludes the services that are set to start automatically
    with a delayed startup.

.PARAMETER ComputerName
    The remote computer(s) to check the status of the services on.

.PARAMETER Credential
    Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action. The default
    is the current user.

.EXAMPLE
     Get-MrAutoStoppedService -ComputerName 'Server1', 'Server2'

.EXAMPLE
     'Server1', 'Server2' | Get-MrAutoStoppedService

.EXAMPLE
     Get-MrAutoStoppedService -ComputerName 'Server1' -Credential (Get-Credential)

.INPUTS
    String

.OUTPUTS
    PSCustomObject

    param (

    )

    #Function Body

}
```

When you add comment based help to your functions, help can be retrieved for them just like the
default built-in commands.

All of the syntax for writing a function in PowerShell can seem overwhelming especially for someone
who is just getting started. Often times if I can't remember the syntax for something, I'll open a
second copy of the ISE on a separate monitor and view the "Cmdlet (advanced function) - Complete"
snippet while typing in the code for my function. Snippets can be accessed in the PowerShell ISE
using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> key combination.

## Summary

In this chapter you've learned the basics of writing functions in PowerShell to include how to turn
a function into an advanced function and some of the more important elements that you should
consider when writing PowerShell functions such as parameter validation, verbose output, pipeline
input, error handling, and comment based help.
