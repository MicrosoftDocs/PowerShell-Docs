# Using familiar command names

PowerShell supports aliases to refer to commands by alternate names. Aliasing allows users with
experience in other shells to use common command names that they already know for similar
operations in PowerShell.

Aliasing associates a new name with another command. For example, PowerShell has an internal
function named `Clear-Host` that clears the output window. You can type either the `cls` or
`clear` alias at a command prompt. PowerShell interprets these aliases and runs the
`Clear-Host` function.

This feature helps users to learn PowerShell. First, most **cmd.exe** and Unix users have a large
repertoire of commands that users already know by name. The PowerShell equivalents may not produce
identical results. However, the results are close enough that users can do work without knowing the
PowerShell command name. "Finger memory" is another major source of frustration when learning a
new command shell. If you have used **cmd.exe** for years, you might reflexively type the `cls` command
to clear the screen. Without the alias for `Clear-Host`, you receive an error message and won't
know what to do to clear the output.

The following list shows a few of the common **cmd.exe** and Unix commands that you can use in
PowerShell:

|||||
|-|-|-|-|
|cat|dir|mount|rm|
|cd|echo|move|rmdir|
|chdir|erase|popd|sleep|
|clear|h|ps|sort|
|cls|history|pushd|tee|
|copy|kill|pwd|type|
|del|lp|r|write|
|diff|ls|ren||

The `Get-Alias` cmdlet shows you the real name of the native PowerShell command associated with an
alias.

```powershell
PS> Get-Alias cls
```

```Output
CommandType     Name                               Version    Source
-----------     ----                               -------    ------
Alias           cls -> Clear-Host
```

## Interpreting standard aliases

The aliases we described previously were designed for name-compatibility with other command shells.
Most aliases built into PowerShell are designed for brevity. Shorter names are easier to type, but
are difficult to read if you don't know what they refer to.

PowerShell aliases try to compromise between clarity and brevity. PowerShell uses a standard set of
aliases for common nouns and verbs.

Example abbreviations:

| Noun or Verb | Abbreviation |
|--------------|--------------|
| Get          | g            |
| Set          | s            |
| Item         | i            |
| Location     | l            |
| Command      | cm           |
| Alias        | al           |

These aliases are understandable when you know the shorthand names.

| Cmdlet name    | Alias |
|----------------|-------|
| `Get-Item`     | gi    |
| `Set-Item`     | si    |
| `Get-Location` | gl    |
| `Set-Location` | sl    |
| `Get-Command`  | gcm   |
| `Get-Alias`    | gal   |

Once you're familiar with PowerShell aliasing, it's easy to guess that the **sal** alias refers
to `Set-Alias`.

## Creating new aliases

You can create your own aliases using the `Set-Alias` cmdlet. For example, the following statements
create the standard cmdlet aliases previously discussed:

```powershell
Set-Alias -Name gi -Value Get-Item
Set-Alias -Name si -Value Set-Item
Set-Alias -Name gl -Value Get-Location
Set-Alias -Name sl -Value Set-Location
Set-Alias -Name gcm -Value Get-Command
```

Internally, PowerShell uses similar commands during startup, but these aliases are not changeable.
If you try to execute one of these commands, you get an error explaining that the alias can't be
modified. For example:

```
PS> Set-Alias -Name gi -Value Get-Item
Set-Alias : Alias is not writeable because alias gi is read-only or constant and cannot be written to.
At line:1 char:10
+ Set-Alias  <<<< -Name gi -Value Get-Item
```
