# Everything you wanted to know about $null

The PowerShell `$null` often appears to be simple but it has a lot of nuances. Let's take a close
look at `$null` so you know what happens when you unexpectedly run into a `$null` value.

## What is NULL?

You can think of NULL as an unknown or empty value. A variable is NULL until you assign a value or
an object to it. This can be important because there are some commands that require a value and
generate errors if the value is NULL.

### PowerShell $null

`$null` is an automatic variable in PowerShell used to represent NULL. You can assign it to
variables, use it in comparisons and use it as a place holder for NULL in a collection.

PowerShell treats `$null` as an object with a value of NULL. This is different than what you may
expect if you come from another language.

## Examples of $null

Anytime you try to use a variable that you have not initialized, the value is `$null`. This is one
of the most common ways that `$null` values sneak into your code.

```powershell
PS> $null -eq $undefinedVariable
True
```

If you happen to mistype a variable name then PowerShell sees it as a different variable and the
value is `$null`.

The other way you find `$null` values is when they come from other commands that don't give you
any results.

```powershell
PS> function Get-Nothing {}
PS> $value = Get-Nothing
PS> $null -eq $value
True
```

## Impact of $null

`$null` values impact your code differently depending on where they show up.

### In strings

If you use `$null` in a string, then it's a blank value (or empty string).

```powershell
PS> $value = $null
PS> Write-Output "The value is $value"
The value is
```

This is one of the reasons that I like to place brackets around variables when using them in log
messages. It's even more important to identify the edges of your variable values when the value is
at the end of the string.

```powershell
PS> $value = $null
PS> Write-Output "The value is [$value]"
The value is []
```

This makes empty strings and `$null` values easy to spot.

### In numeric equation

When a `$null` value is used in a numeric equation then your results are invalid if they don't give
an error. Sometimes the `$null` evaluates to `0` and other times it makes the whole result `$null`.
Here is an example with multiplication that gives 0 or `$null` depending on the order of the values.

```powershell
PS> $null * 5
PS> $null -eq ( $null * 5 )
True

PS> 5 * $null
0
PS> $null -eq ( 5 * $null )
False
```

### In place of a collection

A collection allow you use an index to access values. If you try to index into a collection that is
actually `null`, you get this error: `Cannot index into a null array`.

```powershell
PS> $value = $null
PS> $value[10]
Cannot index into a null array.
At line:1 char:1
+ $value[10]
+ ~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (:) [], RuntimeException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NullArray
```

If you have a collection but try to access an element that is not in the collection, you get a
`$null` result.

```powershell
$array = @( 'one','two','three' )
$null -eq $array[100]
True
```

### In place of an object

If you try to access a property or sub property of an object that doesn't have the specified
property, you get a `$null` value like you would for an undefined variable. It doesn't matter if the
variable is `$null` or an actual object in this case.

```powershell
PS> $null -eq $undefined.some.fake.property
True

PS> $date = Get-Date
PS> $null -eq $date.some.fake.property
True
```

### Method on a null-valued expression

Calling a method on a `$null` object throws a `RuntimeException`.

```powershell
PS> $value = $null
PS> $value.toString()
You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression.
At line:1 char:1
+ $value.tostring()
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (:) [], RuntimeException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvokeMethodOnNull
```

Whenever I see the phrase `You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression` then the first
thing I look for are places where I am calling a method on a variable without first checking it
for `$null`.

## Checking for $null

You may have noticed that I always place the `$null` on the left when checking for `$null` in my
examples. This is intentional and accepted as a PowerShell best practice. There are some scenarios
where placing it on the right doesn't give you the expected result.

Look at this next example and try to predict the results:

```powershell
if ( $value -eq $null )
{
    'The array is $null'
}
if ( $value -ne $null )
{
    'The array is not $null'
}
```

If I do not define `$value`, the first one evaluates to `$true` and our message is
`The array is $null`. The trap here is that it's possible to create a `$value` that allows both of
them to be `$false`

```powershell
$value = @( $null )
```

In this case, the `$value` is an array that contains a `$null`. The `-eq` checks every value in the
array and returns the `$null` that is matched. This evaluates to `$false`. The `-ne` returns
everything that doesn't match `$null` and in this case there are no results (This also evaluates to
`$false`). Neither one is `$true` even though it looks like one of them should be.

Not only can we create a value that makes both of them evaluate to `$false`, it's possible to
create a value where they both evaluate to `$true`. Mathias Jessen (@IISResetMe) has a
[good post][] that dives into that scenario.

### PSScriptAnalyzer and VSCode

The [PSScriptAnalyzer][] module has a rule that checks for this issue called
`PSPossibleIncorrectComparisonWithNull`.

```powershell
PS> Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer ./myscript.ps1

RuleName                              Message
--------                              -------
PSPossibleIncorrectComparisonWithNull $null should be on the left side of equality comparisons.
```

Because VS Code uses the PSScriptAnalyser rules too, it also highlights or identifies this as a
problem in your script.

### Simple if check

A common way that people check for a non-$null value is to use a simple `if()` statement without
the comparison.

```powershell
if ( $value )
{
    Do-Something
}
```

If the value is `$null`, this evaluates to `$false`. This is easy to read, but be careful that it's
looking for exactly what you're expecting it to look for. I read that line of code as:

> If `$value` has a value.

But that's not the whole story. That line is actually saying:

> If `$value` is not `$null` or `0` or `$false` or an `empty string`

Here is a more complete sample of that statement.

```powershell
if ( $null -ne $value -and
        $value -ne 0 -and
        $value -ne '' -and
        $value -ne $false )
{
    Do-Something
}
```

It's perfectly OK to use a basic `if` check as long as you remember those other values count as
`$false` and not just that a variable has a value.

I ran into this issue when refactoring some code a few days ago. It had a basic property check like
this.

```powershell
if ( $object.property )
{
    $object.property = $value
}
```

I wanted to assign a value to the object property only if it existed. In most cases, the original
object had a value that would evaluate to `$true` in the `if` statement. But I ran into an issue
where the value was occasionally not getting set. I debugged the code and found that the object had
the property but it was a blank string value. This prevented it from ever getting updated with the
previous logic. So I added a proper `$null` check and everything worked.

```powershell
if ( $null -ne $object.property )
{
    $object.property = $value
}
```

It's little bugs like these that are hard to spot and make me aggressively check values for `$null`.

## $null.Count

If you try to access a property on a `$null` value, that the property is also `$null`. The `count`
property is the exception to this rule.

```powershell
PS> $value = $null
PS> $value.count
0
```

When you have a `$null` value, then the `count` is `0`. This special property is added by
PowerShell.

### [PSCustomObject] Count

Almost all objects in PowerShell have that count property. One important exception is the
`[PSCustomObject]` in Windows PowerShell 5.1 (This is fixed in PowerShell 6.0). It doesn't have a
count property so you get a `$null` value if you try to use it. I call this out here so that you
don't try to use `.Count` instead of a `$null` check.

Running this example on Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 6.0 gives you different results.

```powershell
$value = [PSCustomObject]@{Name='MyObject'}
if ( $value.count -eq 1 )
{
    "We have a value"
}
```

## Empty null

There is one special type of `$null` that acts differently than the others. I am going to call it
the empty `$null` but it's really a [System.Management.Automation.Internal.AutomationNull][]. This
empty `$null` is the one you get as the result of a function or script block that returns nothing (a
void result).

```powershell
PS> function Get-Nothing {}
PS> $nothing = Get-Nothing
PS> $null -eq $nothing
True
```

If you compare it with `$null`, you get a `$null` value. When used in an evaluation where a value is
required, the value is always `$null`. But if you place it inside an array, it's treated the same as
an empty array.

```powershell
PS> $containempty = @( @() )
PS> $containnothing = @($nothing)
PS> $containnull = @($null)

PS> $containempty.count
0
PS> $containnothing.count
0
PS> $containnull.count
1
```

You can have an array that contains one `$null` value and its `count` is `1`. But if you place
an empty result inside an array then it's not counted as an item. The count is `0`.

If you treat the empty `$null` like a collection, then it's empty.

### Pipeline

The primary place you see the difference is when using the pipeline. You can pipe a `$null`
value but not an empty `$null` value.

```powershell
PS> $null | ForEach-Object{ Write-Output 'NULL Value' }
'NULL Value'
PS> $nothing | ForEach-Object{ Write-Output 'No Value' }
```

Depending on your code, you should account for the `$null` in your logic.

Either check for `$null` first

- Filter out null on the pipeline (`... | Where {$null -ne $_} | ...`)
- Handle it in the pipeline function

## foreach

One of my favorite features of `foreach` is that it doesn't enumerate over a `$null` collection.

```powershell
foreach ( $node in $null )
{
    #skipped
}
```

This saves me from having to `$null` check the collection before I enumerate it. If you have a
collection of `$null` values, the `$node` can still be `$null`.

The foreach started working this way with PowerShell 3.0. If you happen to be on an older version,
then this is not the case. This is one of the important changes to be aware of when back-porting
code for 2.0 compatibility.

## Value types

Technically, only reference types can be `$null`. But PowerShell is very generous and allows for
variables to be any type. If you decide to strongly type a value type, it cannot be `$null`.
PowerShell converts `$null` to a default value for many types.

```powershell
PS> [int]$number = $null
PS> $number
0

PS> [bool]$boolean = $null
PS> $boolean
False

PS> [string]$string = $null
PS> $string -eq ''
True
```

There are some types that do not have a valid conversion from `$null`. These types generate a
`Cannot convert null to type` error.

```powershell
PS> [datetime]$date = $null
Cannot convert null to type "System.DateTime".
At line:1 char:1
+ [datetime]$date = $null
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : MetadataError: (:) [], ArgumentTransformationMetadataException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : RuntimeException
```

### Function parameters

Using a strongly typed values in function parameters is very common. We generally learn to define
the types of our parameters even if we tend not to define the types of other variables in our
scripts. You may already have some strongly typed variables in your functions and not even realize
it.

```powershell
function Do-Something
{
    param(
        [String] $Value
    )
}
```

As soon as you set the type of the parameter as a `string`, the value can never be `$null`. It's
common to check if a value is `$null` to see if the user provided a value or not.

```powershell
if ( $null -ne $Value ){...}
```

`$Value` is an empty string `''` when no value is provided. Use the automatic variable
`$PSBoundParameters.Value` instead.

```powershell
if ( $null -ne $PSBoundParameters.Value ){...}
```

`$PSBoundParameters` only contains the parameters that were specified when the function was called.
You can also use the `ContainsKey` method to check for the property.

```powershell
if ( $PSBoundParameters.ContainsKey('Value') ){...}
```

### IsNotNullOrEmpty

If the value is a string, you can use a static string function to check if the value is `$null` or
an empty string at the same time.

```powershell
if ( -not [string]::IsNullOrEmpty( $value ) ){...}
```

I find myself using this often when I know the value type should be a string.

## When I $null check

I am a defensive scripter. Anytime I call a function and assign it to a variable, I check it for
`$null`.

```powershell
$userList = Get-ADUser kevmar
if ($null -ne $userList){...}
```

I much prefer using `if` or `foreach` over using `try/catch`. Don't get me wrong, I still use
`try/catch` a lot. But if I can test for an error condition or an empty set of results, I can allow
my exception handling be for true exceptions.

I also tend to check for `$null` before I index into a value or call methods on an object. These two
actions fail for a `$null` object so I find it important to validate them first. I already covered
those scenarios earlier in this post.

### No results scenario

It's important to know that different functions and commands handle the no results scenario
differently. Many PowerShell commands return the empty `$null` and an error in the error stream. But
others throw exceptions or give you a status object. It's still up to you to know how the commands
you use deal with the no results and error scenarios.

## Initializing to $null

One habit that I have picked up is initializing all my variables before I use them. You are required
to do this in other languages. At the top of my function or as I enter a foreach loop, I define all
the values that I'm using.

Here is a scenario that I want you to take a close look at. It's an example of a bug I had to chase
down before.

```powershell
function Do-Something
{
    foreach ( $node in 1..6 )
    {
        try
        {
            $result = Get-Something -ID $node
        }
        catch
        {
            Write-Verbose "[$result] not valid"
        }

        if ( $null -ne $result )
        {
            Update-Something $result
        }
    }
}
```

The expectation here is that `Get-Something` returns either a result or an empty `$null`. If there
is an error, we log it. Then we check to make sure we got a valid result before processing it.

The bug hiding in this code is when `Get-Something` throws an exception and doesn't assign a value
to `$result`. It fails before the assignment so we don't even assign `$null` to the `$result`
variable. `$result` still contains the previous valid `$result` from other iterations.
`Update-Something` to execute multiple times on the same object in this example.

I set `$result` to `$null` right inside the foreach loop before I use it to mitigate this issue.

```powershell
foreach ( $node in 1..6 )
{
    $result = $null
    try
    {
        ...
```

### Scope issues

This also helps mitigate scoping issues. In that example, we assign values to `$result` over and
over in a loop. But because PowerShell allows variable values from outside the function to bleed
into the scope of the current function, initializing them inside your function mitigates bugs
that can be introduced that way.

An uninitialized variable in your function is not `$null` if it's set to a value in a parent scope.
The parent scope could be another function that calls your function and uses the same variable
names.

If I take that same `Do-something` example and remove the loop, I would end up with something that
looks like this example:

```powershell
function Invoke-Something
{
    $result = 'ParentScope'
    Do-Something
}

function Do-Something
{
    try
    {
        $result = Get-Something -ID $node
    }
    catch
    {
        Write-Verbose "[$result] not valid"
    }

    if ( $null -ne $result )
    {
        Update-Something $result
    }
}
```

If the call to `Get-Something` throws an exception, then my `$null` check finds the `$result` from
`Invoke-Something`. Initializing the value inside your function mitigates this issue.

Naming variables is hard and it's common for an author to use the same variable names in multiple
functions. I know I use `$node`,`$result`,`$data` all the time. So it would be very easy for values
from different scopes to show up in places where they should not be.

## Redirect output to $null

I have been talking about `$null` values for this entire article but the topic is not complete if I
didn't mention redirecting output to `$null`. There are times when you have commands that output
information or objects that you want to suppress. Redirecting output to `$null` does that.

### Out-Null

The Out-Null command is the built-in way to redirect pipeline data to `$null`.

```powershell
New-Item -Type Directory -Path $path | Out-Null
```

### Assign to $null

You can assign the results of a command to `$null` for the same effect as using `Out-Null`.

```powershell
$null = New-Item -Type Directory -Path $path
```

Because `$null` is a constant value, you can never overwrite it. I don't like the way it looks in my
code but it often performs faster than `Out-Null`.

### Redirect to $null

You can also use the redirection operator to send output to `$null`.

```powershell
New-Item -Type Directory -Path $path > $null
```

If you're dealing with command-line executables that output on the different streams. You can
redirect all output streams to `$null` like this:

```powershell
git status *> $null
```

## Summary

I covered a lot of ground on this one and I know this article is more fragmented than most of my
deep dives. That is because `$null` values can pop up in many different places in PowerShell and all
the nuances are specific to where you find it. I hope you walk away from this with a better
understanding of `$null` and an awareness of the more obscure scenarios you may run into.
