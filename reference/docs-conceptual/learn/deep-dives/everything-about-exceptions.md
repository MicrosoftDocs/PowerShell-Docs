# Everything you wanted to know about exceptions

Error handling is just part of life when it comes to writing code. We can often check and validate
conditions for expected behavior. When the unexpected happens, we turn to exception handling. You
can easily handle exceptions generated by other people's code or you can generate your own
exceptions for others to handle.

## Basic terminology

We need to cover some basic terms before we jump into this one.

### Exception

An Exception is like an event that is created when normal error handling can't deal with the issue.
Trying to divide a number by zero or running out of memory are examples of something that creates an
exception. Sometimes the author of the code you're using creates exceptions for certain issues
when they happen.

### Throw and Catch

When an exception happens, we say that an exception is thrown. To handle a thrown exception, you
need to catch it. If an exception is thrown and it isn't caught by something, the script stops
executing.

### The call stack

The call stack is the list of functions that have called each other. When a function is called, it
gets added to the stack or the top of the list. When the function exits or returns, it is removed
from the stack.

When an exception is thrown, that call stack is checked in order for an exception handler to catch
it.

### Terminating and non-terminating errors

An exception is generally a terminating error. A thrown exception is either be caught or it
terminates the current execution. By default, a non-terminating error is generated by `Write-Error`
and it adds an error to the output stream without throwing an exception.

I point this out because `Write-Error` and other non-terminating errors do not trigger the
`catch`.

### Swallowing an exception

This is when you catch an error just to suppress it. Do this with caution because it can make
troubleshooting issues very difficult.

## Basic command syntax

Here is a quick overview of the basic exception handling syntax used in PowerShell.

### Throw

To create our own exception event, we throw an exception with the `throw` keyword.

```powershell
function Do-Something
{
    throw "Bad thing happened"
}
```

This creates a runtime exception that is a terminating error. It's handled by a `catch` in a
calling function or exits the script with a message like this.

```powershell
PS> Do-Something

Bad thing happened
At line:1 char:1
+ throw "Bad thing happened"
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : OperationStopped: (Bad thing happened:String) [], RuntimeException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Bad thing happened
```

#### Write-Error -ErrorAction Stop

I mentioned that `Write-Error` doesn't throw a terminating error by default. If you specify
`-ErrorAction Stop`, `Write-Error`generates a terminating error that can be handled with a
`catch`.

```powershell
Write-Error -Message "Houston, we have a problem." -ErrorAction Stop
```

Thank you to Lee Daily for reminding about using `-ErrorAction Stop` this way.

#### Cmdlet -ErrorAction Stop

If you specify `-ErrorAction Stop` on any advanced function or cmdlet, it turns all `Write-Error`
statements into terminating errors that stop execution or that can be handled by a `catch`.

```powershell
Do-Something -ErrorAction Stop
```

### Try/Catch

The way exception handling works in PowerShell (and many other languages) is that you first `try` a
section of code and if it throws an error, you can `catch` it. Here is a quick sample.

```powershell
try
{
    Do-Something
}
catch
{
    Write-Output "Something threw an exception"
}

try
{
    Do-Something -ErrorAction Stop
}
catch
{
    Write-Output "Something threw an exception or used Write-Error"
}
```

The `catch` script only runs if there's a terminating error. If the `try` executes correctly, then
it skips over the `catch`.

### Try/Finally

Sometimes you don't need to handle an error but still need some code to execute if an exception
happens or not. A `finally` script does exactly that.

Take a look at this example:

```powershell
$command = [System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand]::New(queryString, connection)
$command.Connection.Open()
$command.ExecuteNonQuery()
$command.Connection.Close()
```

Anytime you open or connect to a resource, you should close it. If the `ExecuteNonQuery()` throws
an exception, the connection isn't closed. Here is the same code inside a `try/finally` block.

```powershell
$command = [System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand]::New(queryString, connection)
try
{
    $command.Connection.Open()
    $command.ExecuteNonQuery()
}
finally
{
    $command.Connection.Close()
}
```

In this example, the connection is closed if there's an error. It also is closed if there's no
error. The `finally` script runs every time.

Because you're not catching the exception, it still gets propagated up the call stack.

### Try/Catch/Finally

It's perfectly valid to use `catch` and `finally` together. Most of the time you'll use one or
the other, but you may find scenarios where you use both.

## $PSItem

Now that we got the basics out of the way, we can dig a little deeper.

Inside the `catch` block, there's an automatic variable (`$PSItem` or `$_`) of type `ErrorRecord`
that contains the details about the exception. Here is a quick overview of some of the key
properties.

For these examples, I used an invalid path in `ReadAllText` to generate this exception.

```powershell
[System.IO.File]::ReadAllText( '\\test\no\filefound.log')
```

### PSItem.ToString()

This gives you the cleanest message to use in logging and general output. `ToString()` is
automatically called if `$PSItem` is placed inside a string.

```powershell
catch
{
    Write-Output "Ran into an issue: $($PSItem.ToString())"
}

catch
{
    Write-Output "Ran into an issue: $PSItem"
}
```

### $PSItem.InvocationInfo

This property contains additional information collected by PowerShell about the function or script
where the exception was thrown. Here is the `InvocationInfo` from the sample exception that I
created.

```powershell
PS> $PSItem.InvocationInfo | Format-List *

MyCommand             : Get-Resource
BoundParameters       : {}
UnboundArguments      : {}
ScriptLineNumber      : 5
OffsetInLine          : 5
ScriptName            : C:\blog\throwerror.ps1
Line                  :     Get-Resource
PositionMessage       : At C:\blog\throwerror.ps1:5 char:5
                        +     Get-Resource
                        +     ~~~~~~~~~~~~
PSScriptRoot          : C:\blog
PSCommandPath         : C:\blog\throwerror.ps1
InvocationName        : Get-Resource
```

The important details here show the `ScriptName`, the `Line` of code and the `ScriptLineNumber`
where the invocation started.

### $PSItem.ScriptStackTrace

This property shows the order of function calls that got you to the code where the exception was
generated.

```powershell
PS> $PSItem.ScriptStackTrace
at Get-Resource, C:\blog\throwerror.ps1: line 13
at Do-Something, C:\blog\throwerror.ps1: line 5
at <ScriptBlock>, C:\blog\throwerror.ps1: line 18
```

I'm only making calls to functions in the same script but this would track the calls if multiple
scripts were involved.

### $PSItem.Exception

This is the actual exception that was thrown.

#### $PSItem.Exception.Message

This is the general message that describes the exception and is a good starting point when
troubleshooting. Most exceptions have a default message but can also be set to something custom when
the exception is thrown.

```powershell
PS> $PSItem.Exception.Message

Exception calling "ReadAllText" with "1" argument(s): "The network path was not found."
```

This is also the message returned when calling `$PSItem.ToString()` if there was not one set on the
`ErrorRecord`.

#### $PSItem.Exception.InnerException

Exceptions can contain inner exceptions. This is often the case when the code you're calling
catches an exception and throws a different exception. The original exception is placed inside
the new exception.

```powershell
PS> $PSItem.Exception.InnerExceptionMessage
The network path was not found.
```

I will revisit this later when I talk about re-throwing exceptions.

#### $PSItem.Exception.StackTrace

This is the `StackTrace` for the exception. I showed a `ScriptStackTrace` above, but this one is for
the calls to managed code.

```Output
at System.IO.FileStream.Init(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, Int32 rights, Boolean
 useRights, FileShare share, Int32 bufferSize, FileOptions options, SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES secAttrs,
 String msgPath, Boolean bFromProxy, Boolean useLongPath, Boolean checkHost)
at System.IO.FileStream..ctor(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, FileShare share, Int32
 bufferSize, FileOptions options, String msgPath, Boolean bFromProxy, Boolean useLongPath, Boolean
 checkHost)
at System.IO.StreamReader..ctor(String path, Encoding encoding, Boolean detectEncodingFromByteOrderMarks,
 Int32 bufferSize, Boolean checkHost)
at System.IO.File.InternalReadAllText(String path, Encoding encoding, Boolean checkHost)
at CallSite.Target(Closure , CallSite , Type , String )
```

You only get this stack trace when the event is thrown from managed code. I'm calling a .NET
framework function directly so that is all we can see in this example. Generally when you're
looking at a stack trace, you're looking for where your code stops and the system calls begin.

## Working with exceptions

There is more to exceptions than the basic syntax and exception properties.

### Catching typed exceptions

You can be selective with the exceptions that you catch. Exceptions have a type and you can specify
the type of exception you want to catch.

```powershell
try
{
    Do-Something -Path $path
}
catch [System.IO.FileNotFoundException]
{
    Write-Output "Could not find $path"
}
catch [System.IO.IOException]
{
        Write-Output "IO error with the file: $path"
}
```

The exception type is checked for each `catch` block until one is found that matches your exception.
It's important to realize that exceptions can inherit from other exceptions. In the example above,
`FileNotFoundException` inherits from `IOException`. So if the `IOException` was first, then it
would get called instead. Only one catch block is invoked even if there are multiple matches.

If we had a `System.IO.PathTooLongException`, the `IOException` would match but if we had a
`InsufficientMemoryException` then nothing would catch it and it would propagate up the stack.

### Catch multiple types at once

It's possible to catch multiple exception types with the same `catch` statement.

```powershell
try
{
    Do-Something -Path $path -ErrorAction Stop
}
catch [System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException],[System.IO.FileNotFoundException]
{
    Write-Output "The path or file was not found: [$path]"
}
catch [System.IO.IOException]
{
    Write-Output "IO error with the file: [$path]"
}
```

Thank you `/u/Sheppard_Ra` for suggesting this addition.

### Throwing typed exceptions

You can throw typed exceptions in PowerShell. Instead of calling `throw` with a string:

```powershell
throw "Could not find: $path"
```

Use an exception accelerator like this:

```powershell
throw [System.IO.FileNotFoundException] "Could not find: $path"
```

But you have to specify a message when you do it that way.

You can also create a new instance of an exception to be thrown. The message is optional when you do
this because the system has default messages for all built-in exceptions.

```powershell
throw [System.IO.FileNotFoundException]::new()
throw [System.IO.FileNotFoundException]::new("Could not find path: $path")
```

If you're not using PowerShell 5.0 or higher, you must use the older `New-Object` approach.

```powershell
throw (New-Object -TypeName System.IO.FileNotFoundException )
throw (New-Object -TypeName System.IO.FileNotFoundException -ArgumentList "Could not find path: $path")
```

By using a typed exception, you (or others) can catch the exception by the type as mentioned in the
previous section.

#### Write-Error -Exception

We can add these typed exceptions to `Write-Error` and we can still `catch` the errors by exception
type. Use `Write-Error` like in these examples:

```powershell
# with normal message
Write-Error -Message "Could not find path: $path" -Exception ([System.IO.FileNotFoundException]::new()) -ErrorAction Stop

# With message inside new exception
Write-Error -Exception ([System.IO.FileNotFoundException]::new("Could not find path: $path")) -ErrorAction Stop

# Pre PS 5.0
Write-Error -Exception ([System.IO.FileNotFoundException]"Could not find path: $path") -ErrorAction Stop

Write-Error -Message "Could not find path: $path" -Exception ( New-Object -TypeName System.IO.FileNotFoundException ) -ErrorAction Stop
```

Then we can catch it like this:

```powershell
catch [System.IO.FileNotFoundException]
{
    Write-Log $PSItem.ToString()
}
```

#### The big list of .NET exceptions

I compiled a master list with the help of the [Reddit/r/PowerShell community][] that contains
hundreds of .NET exceptions to complement this post.

- [The big list of .NET exceptions][]

I start by searching that list for exceptions that feel like they would be a good fit for my
situation. You should try to use exceptions in the base `System` namespace.

### Exceptions are objects

If you start using a lot of typed exceptions, remember that they are objects. Different exceptions
have different constructors and properties. If we look at the [FileNotFoundException][]
documentation for `System.IO.FileNotFoundException`, we see that we can pass in a message and a file
path.

```powershell
[System.IO.FileNotFoundException]::new("Could not find file", $path)
```

And it has a `FileName` property that exposes that file path.

```powershell
catch [System.IO.FileNotFoundException]
{
    Write-Output $PSItem.Exception.FileName
}
```

You should consult the [.NET documentation][] for other constructors and object properties.

### Re-throwing an exception

If all you're going to do in your `catch` block is `throw` the same exception, then don't `catch`
it. You should only `catch` an exception that you plan to handle or perform some action when it
happens.

There are times where you want to perform an action on an exception but re-throw the exception so
something downstream can deal with it. We could write a message or log the problem close to where we
discover it but handle the issue further up the stack.

```powershell
catch
{
    Write-Log $PSItem.ToString()
    throw $PSItem
}
```

Interestingly enough, we can call `throw` from within the `catch` and it re-throws the current
exception.

```powershell
catch
{
    Write-Log $PSItem.ToString()
    throw
}
```

We want to re-throw the exception to preserve the original execution information like source script
and line number. If we throw a new exception at this point, it hides where the exception started.

#### Re-throwing a new exception

If you catch an exception but you want to throw a different one, then you should nest the original
exception inside the new one. This allows someone down the stack to access it as the
`$PSItem.Exception.InnerException`.

```powershell
catch
{
    throw [System.MissingFieldException]::new('Could not access field',$PSItem.Exception)
}
```

#### $PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError()

The one thing that I don't like about using `throw` for raw exceptions is that the error message
points at the `throw` statement and indicates that line is where the problem is.

```Output
Unable to find the specified file.
At line:31 char:9
+         throw [System.IO.FileNotFoundException]::new()
+         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : OperationStopped: (:) [], FileNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Unable to find the specified file.
```


Having the error message tell me that my script is broken because I called `throw` on line 31 is a
bad message for users of your script to see. It doesn't tell them anything useful.

Dexter Dhami pointed out that I can use `ThrowTerminatingError()` to correct that.

```powershell
$PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError(
    [System.Management.Automation.ErrorRecord]::new(
        ([System.IO.FileNotFoundException]"Could not find $Path"),
        'My.ID',
        [System.Management.Automation.ErrorCategory]::OpenError,
        $MyObject
    )
)
```

If we assume that `ThrowTerminatingError()` was called inside a function called `Get-Resource`, then
this is the error that we would see.

```Output
Get-Resource : Could not find C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference
Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\.NETPortable\v4.6\System.IO.xml
At line:6 char:5
+     Get-Resource -Path $Path
+     ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : OpenError: (:) [Get-Resource], FileNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : My.ID,Get-Resource
```

Do you see how it points to the `Get-Resource` function as the source of the problem? That tells the
user something useful.

Because `$PSItem` is an `ErrorRecord`, we can also use `ThrowTerminatingError` this way to re-throw.

```powershell
catch
{
    $PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError($PSItem)
}
```

This changes the source of the error to the Cmdlet and hide the internals of your function from
the users of your Cmdlet.

## Try can create terminating errors

Kirk Munro points out that some exceptions are only terminating errors when executed inside a
`try/catch` block. Here is the example he gave me that generates a divide by zero runtime exception.

```powershell
function Do-Something { 1/(1-1) }
```

Then invoke it like this to see it generate the error and still output the message.

```powershell
&{ Do-Something; Write-Output "We did it. Send Email" }
```

But by placing that same code inside a `try/catch`, we see something else happen.

```powershell
try
{
    &{ Do-Something; Write-Output "We did it. Send Email" }
}
catch
{
    Write-Output "Notify Admin to fix error and send email"
}
```


We see the error become a terminating error and not output the first message. What I don't like
about this one is that you can have this code in a function and it acts differently if someone
is using a `try/catch`.

I have not ran into issues with this myself but it is corner case to be aware of.

### $PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError() inside try/catch

One nuance of `$PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError()` is that it creates a terminating error within your
Cmdlet but it turns into a non-terminating error after it leaves your Cmdlet. This leaves the burden
on the caller of your function to decide how to handle the error. They can turn it back into a
terminating error by using `-ErrorAction Stop` or calling it from within a `try{...}catch{...}`.

### Public function templates

One last take a way I had with my conversation with Kirk Munro was that he places a
`try{...}catch{...}` around every `begin`, `process` and `end` block in all of his advanced
functions. In those generic catch blocks, he as a single line using
`$PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError($PSitem)` to deal with all exceptions leaving his functions.

```powershell
function Do-Something
{
    [cmdletbinding()]
    param()

    process
    {
        try
        {
            ...
        }
        catch
        {
            $PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError($PSitem)
        }
    }
}
```

Because everything is in a `try` statement within his functions, everything acts consistently. This
also gives clean errors to the end user that hides the internal code from the generated error.

## Trap

I focused on the `try/catch` aspect of exceptions. But there's one legacy feature I need to mention
before we wrap this up.

A `trap` is placed in a script or function to catch all exceptions that happen in that scope. When
an exception happens, the code in the `trap` is executed and then the normal code continues. If
multiple exceptions happen, then the trap is called over and over.

```powershell
trap
{
    Write-Log $PSItem.ToString()
}

throw [System.Exception]::new('first')
throw [System.Exception]::new('second')
throw [System.Exception]::new('third')
```

I personally never adopted this approach but I can see the value in admin or controller scripts that
log any and all exceptions, then still continue to execute.

## Closing remarks

Adding proper exception handling to your scripts not only make them more stable, but also makes it
easier for you to troubleshoot those exceptions.

I spent a lot of time talking `throw` because it is a core concept when talking about exception
handling. PowerShell also gave us `Write-Error` that handles all the situations where you would use
`throw`. So don't think that you need to be using `throw` after reading this.

Now that I have taken the time to write about exception handling in this detail, I'm going to
switch over to using `Write-Error -Stop` to generate errors in my code. I'm also going to take
Kirk's advice and make `ThrowTerminatingError` my goto exception handler for every function.
