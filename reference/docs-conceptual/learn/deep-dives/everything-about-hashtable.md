# Everything you wanted to know about hashtables

I want to take a step back and talk about [hashtables][]. I use them all the time now. I was
teaching someone about them after our user group meeting last night and I realized I had the same
confusion about them as he had. Hashtables are really important in PowerShell so it's good to have a
solid understanding of them.

## Hashtable as a collection of things

I want you to first see a **Hashtable** as a collection in the traditional definition of a
hashtable. This definition gives you a fundamental understanding of how they work when they get used
for more advanced stuff later. Skipping this understanding is often a source of confusion.

## What is an array?

Before I jump into what a **Hashtable** is, I need to mention [arrays][] first. For the purpose of
this discussion, an array is a list or collection of values or objects.

```powershell
$array = @(1,2,3,5,7,11)
```

Once you have your items into an array, you can either use `foreach` to iterate over the list or use
an index to access individual elements in the array.

```powershell
foreach($item in $array)
{
    Write-Output $item
}

Write-Output $array[3]
```

You can also update values using an index in the same way.

```powershell
$array[2] = 13
```

I just scratched the surface on arrays but that should put them into the right context as I move
onto hashtables.

## What is a hashtable?

I'm going to start with a basic technical description of what hashtables are, in the general sense,
before I shift into the other ways PowerShell uses them.

A hashtable is a data structure, much like an array, except you store each value (object) using a
key. It's a basic key/value store. First, we create an empty hashtable.

```powershell
$ageList = @{}
```

Notice that braces, instead of parentheses, are used to define a hashtable. Then we add an item
using a key like this:

```powershell
$key = 'Kevin'
$value = 36
$ageList.add( $key, $value )

$ageList.add( 'Alex', 9 )
```

The person's name is the key and their age is the value that I want to save.

## Using the brackets for access

Once you add your values to the hashtable, you can pull them back out using that same key (instead
of using a numeric index like you would have for an array).

```powershell
$ageList['Kevin']
$ageList['Alex']
```

When I want Kevin's age, I use his name to access it. We can use this approach to add or update
values into the hashtable too. This is just like using the `add()` function above.

```powershell
$ageList = @{}

$key = 'Kevin'
$value = 36
$ageList[$key] = $value

$ageList['Alex'] = 9
```

There's another syntax you can use for accessing and updating values that I'll cover in a later
section. If you're coming to PowerShell from another language, these examples should fit in with
how you may have used hashtables before.

### Creating hashtables with values

So far I've created an empty hashtable for these examples. You can pre-populate the keys and
values when you create them.

```powershell
$ageList = @{
    Kevin = 36
    Alex  = 9
}
```

### As a lookup table

The real value of this type of a hashtable is that you can use them as a lookup table. Here is a
simple example.

```powershell
$environments = @{
    Prod = 'SrvProd05'
    QA   = 'SrvQA02'
    Dev  = 'SrvDev12'
}

$server = $environments[$env]
```

In this example, you specify an environment for the `$env` variable and it will pick the correct
server. You could use a `switch($env){...}` for a selection like this but a hashtable is a nice
option.

This gets even better when you dynamically build the lookup table to use it later. So think about
using this approach when you need to cross reference something. I think we would see this even more
if PowerShell wasn't so good at filtering on the pipe with `Where-Object`. If you're ever in a
situation where performance matters, this approach needs to be considered.

I won't say that it's faster, but it does fit into the rule of [If performance matters, test it][].

#### Multiselection

Generally, you think of a hashtable as a key/value pair, where you provide one key and get one
value. PowerShell allows you to provide an array of keys to get multiple values.

```powershell
$environments[@('QA','DEV')]
$environments[('QA','DEV')]
$environments['QA','DEV']
```

In this example, I use the same lookup hashtable from above and provide three different array styles
to get the matches. This is a hidden gem in PowerShell that most people aren't aware of.

## Iterating hashtables

Because a hashtable is a collection of key/value pairs, you iterate over it differently than you do
for an array or a normal list of items.

The first thing to notice is that if you pipe your hashtable, the pipe treats it like one object.

```powershell
PS> $ageList | Measure-Object
count : 1
```

Even though the `.count` property tells you how many values it contains.

```powershell
PS> $ageList.count
2
```

You get around this issue by using the `.values` property if all you need is just the values.

```powershell
PS> $ageList.values | Measure-Object -Average
Count   : 2
Average : 22.5
```

It's often more useful to enumerate the keys and use them to access the values.

```powershell
PS> $ageList.keys | ForEach-Object{
    $message = '{0} is {1} years old!' -f $_, $ageList[$_]
    Write-Output $message
}
Kevin is 36 years old
Alex is 9 years old
```

Here is the same example with a `foreach(){...}` loop.

```powershell
foreach($key in $ageList.keys)
{
    $message = '{0} is {1} years old' -f $key, $ageList[$key]
    Write-Output $message
}
```

We are walking each key in the hashtable and then using it to access the value. This is a common
pattern when working with hashtables as a collection.

### GetEnumerator()

That brings us to `GetEnumerator()` for iterating over our hashtable.

```powershell
$ageList.GetEnumerator() | ForEach-Object{
    $message = '{0} is {1} years old!' -f $_.key, $_.value
    Write-Output $message
}
```

The enumerator gives you each key/value pair one after another. It was designed specifically for
this use case. Thank you to [Mark Kraus](https://get-PowerShellblog.blogspot.com) for reminding me
of this one.

### BadEnumeration

One important detail is that you can't modify a hashtable while it's being enumerated. If we start
with our basic `$environments` example:

```powershell
$environments = @{
    Prod = 'SrvProd05'
    QA   = 'SrvQA02'
    Dev  = 'SrvDev12'
}
```

And trying to set every key to the same server value fails.

```powershell
$environments.Keys | ForEach-Object {
    $environments[$_] = 'SrvDev03'
}

An error occurred while enumerating through a collection: Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute.
+ CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: tableEnumerator:HashtableEnumerator) [], RuntimeException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : BadEnumeration
```

This will also fail even though it looks like it should also be fine:

```powershell
foreach($key in $environments.keys) {
    $environments[$key] = 'SrvDev03'
}

Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute.
    + CategoryInfo          : OperationStopped: (:) [], InvalidOperationException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.InvalidOperationException
```

The trick to this situation is to clone the keys before doing the enumeration.

```powershell
$environments.Keys.Clone() | ForEach-Object {
    $environments[$_] = 'SrvDev03'
}
```

## Hashtable as a collection of properties

So far the type of objects we placed in our hashtable were all the same type of object. I used ages
in all those examples and the key was the person's name. This is a great way to look at it when your
collection of objects each have a name. Another common way to use hashtables in PowerShell is to
hold a collection of properties where the key is the name of the property. I'll step into that idea
in this next example.

### Property-based access

The use of property-based access changes the dynamics of hashtables and how you can use them in
PowerShell. Here is our usual example from above treating the keys as properties.

```powershell
$ageList = @{}
$ageList.Kevin = 35
$ageList.Alex = 9
```

Just like the examples above, this example adds those keys if they don't exist in the hashtable
already. Depending on how you defined your keys and what your values are, this is either a
little strange or a perfect fit. The age list example has worked great up until this point. We need
a new example for this to feel right going forward.

```powershell
$person = @{
    name = 'Kevin'
    age  = 36
}
```

And we can add and access attributes on the `$person` like this.

```powershell
$person.city = 'Austin'
$person.state = 'TX'
```

All of a sudden this hashtable starts to feel and act like an object. It's still a collection of
things, so all the examples above still apply. We just approach it from a different point of view.

### Checking for keys and values

In most cases, you can just test for the value with something like this:

```powershell
if( $person.age ){...}
```

It's simple but has been the source of many bugs for me because I was overlooking one important
detail in my logic. I started to use it to test if a key was present. When the value was `$false` or
zero, that statement would return `$false` unexpectedly.

```powershell
if( $person.age -ne $null ){...}
```

This works around that issue for zero values but not $null vs non-existent keys. Most of the time
you don't need to make that distinction but there are functions for when you do.

```powershell
if( $person.ContainsKey('age') ){...}
```

We also have a `ContainsValue()` for the situation where you need to test for a value without
knowing the key or iterating the whole collection.

### Removing and clearing keys

You can remove keys with the `.Remove()` function.

```powershell
$person.remove('age')
```

Assigning them a `$null` value just leaves you with a key that has a `$null` value.

A common way to clear a hashtable is to just initialize it to an empty hashtable.

```powershell
$person = @{}
```

While that does work, try to use the `clear()` function instead.

```powershell
$person.clear()
```

This is one of those instances where using the function creates self-documenting code and it makes
the intentions of the code very clean.

## All the fun stuff

### Ordered hashtables

By default, hashtables aren't ordered (or sorted). In the traditional context, the order doesn't
matter when you always use a key to access values. You may find that you want the properties to stay
in the order that you define them. Thankfully, there's a way to do that with the `ordered` keyword.

```powershell
$person = [ordered]@{
    name = 'Kevin'
    age  = 36
}
```

Now when you enumerate the keys and values, they stay in that order.

### Inline hashtables

When you're defining a hashtable on one line, you can separate the key/value pairs with a
semicolon.

```powershell
$person = @{ name = 'kevin'; age = 36; }
```

This will come in handy if you're creating them on the pipe.

### Custom expressions in common pipeline commands

There are a few cmdlets that support the use of hashtables to create custom or calculated
properties. You commonly see this with `Select-Object` and `Format-Table`. The hashtables have a
special syntax that looks like this when fully expanded.

```powershell
$property = @{
    name = 'totalSpaceGB'
    expression = { ($_.used + $_.free) / 1GB }
}
```

The `name` is what the cmdlet would label that column. The `expression` is a script block that is
executed where `$_` is the value of the object on the pipe. Here is that script in action:

```powershell
$drives = Get-PSDrive | Where Used
$drives | Select-Object -Properties name, $property

Name     totalSpaceGB
----     ------------
C    238.472652435303
```

I placed that in a variable but it could easily be defined inline and you can shorten `name` to `n`
and `expression` to `e` while you're at it.

```powershell
$drives | Select-Object -properties name, @{n='totalSpaceGB';e={($_.used + $_.free) / 1GB}}
```

I personally don't like how long that makes commands and it often promotes some bad behaviors that I
won't get into. I'm more likely to create a new hashtable or `pscustomobject` with all the fields
and properties that I want instead of using this approach in scripts. But there's a lot of code out
there that does this so I wanted you to be aware of it. I talk about creating a `pscustomobject`
later on.

### Custom sort expression

It's easy to sort a collection if the objects have the data that you want to sort on. You can
either add the data to the object before you sort it or create a custom expression for
`Sort-Object`.

```powershell
Get-ADUser | Sort-Object -Parameter @{ e={ Get-TotalSales $_.Name } }
```

In this example I'm taking a list of users and using some custom cmdlet to get additional
information just for the sort.

#### Sort a list of Hashtables

If you have a list of hashtables that you want to sort, you'll find that the `Sort-Object` doesn't
treat your keys as properties. We can get a round that by using a custom sort expression.

```powershell
$data = @(
    @{name='a'}
    @{name='c'}
    @{name='e'}
    @{name='f'}
    @{name='d'}
    @{name='b'}
)

$data | Sort-Object -Property @{e={$_.name}}
```

## Splatting hashtables at cmdlets

This is one of my favorite things about hashtables that many people don't discover early on.
The idea is that instead of providing all the properties to a cmdlet on one line, you can instead
pack them into a hashtable first. Then you can give the hashtable to the function in a special way.
Here is an example of creating a DHCP scope the normal way.

```powershell
Add-DhcpServerv4Scope -Name 'TestNetwork' -StartRange'10.0.0.2' -EndRange '10.0.0.254' -SubnetMask '255.255.255.0' -Description 'Network for testlab A' -LeaseDuration (New-TimeSpan -Days 8) -Type "Both"
```

Without using [splatting][], all those things need to be defined on a single line. It either scrolls
off the screen or will wrap where ever it feels like. Now compare that to a command that uses
splatting.

```powershell
$DHCPScope = @{
    Name        = 'TestNetwork'
    StartRange  = '10.0.0.2'
    EndRange    = '10.0.0.254'
    SubnetMask  = '255.255.255.0'
    Description = 'Network for testlab A'
    LeaseDuration = (New-TimeSpan -Days 8)
    Type = "Both"
}
Add-DhcpServerv4Scope @DHCPScope
```

The use of the `@` sign instead of the `$` is what invokes the splat operation.

Just take a moment to appreciate how easy that example is to read. They are the exact same command
with all the same values. The second one is easier to understand and maintain going forward.

I use splatting anytime the command gets too long. I define too long as causing my window to scroll
right. If I hit three properties for a function, odds are that I'll rewrite it using a splatted
hashtable.

### Splatting for optional parameters

One of the most common ways I use splatting is to deal with optional parameters that come from
some place else in my script. Let's say I have a function that wraps a `Get-CIMInstance` call that
has an optional `$Credential` argument.

```powershell
$CIMParams = @{
    ClassName = 'Win32_Bios'
    ComputerName = $ComputerName
}

if($Credential)
{
    $CIMParams.Credential = $Credential
}

Get-CIMInstance @CIMParams
```

I start by creating my hashtable with common parameters. Then I add the `$Credential` if it exists.
Because I'm using splatting here, I only need to have the call to `Get-CIMInstance` in my code
once. This design pattern is very clean and can handle lots of optional parameters easily.

To be fair, you could write your commands to allow `$null` values for parameters. You just don't
always have control over the other commands you're calling.

### Multiple splats

You can splat multiple hashtables to the same cmdlet. If we revisit our original splatting example:

```powershell
$Common = @{
    SubnetMask  = '255.255.255.0'
    LeaseDuration = (New-TimeSpan -Days 8)
    Type = "Both"
}

$DHCPScope = @{
    Name        = 'TestNetwork'
    StartRange  = '10.0.0.2'
    EndRange    = '10.0.0.254'
    Description = 'Network for testlab A'
}

Add-DhcpServerv4Scope @DHCPScope @Common
```

I'll use this method when I have a common set of parameters that I'm passing to lots of commands.

### Splatting for clean code

There's nothing wrong with splatting a single parameter if makes you code cleaner.

```powershell
$log = @{Path = '.\logfile.log'}
Add-Content "logging this command" @log
```

### Splatting executables

Splatting also works on some executables that use a `/param:value` syntax. `Robocopy.exe`, for
example, has some parameters like this.

```powershell
$robo = @{R=1;W=1;MT=8}
robocopy source destination @robo
```

I don't know that this is all that useful, but I found it interesting.

## Adding hashtables

Hashtables support the addition operator to combine two hashtables.

```powershell
$person += @{Zip = '78701'}
```

This only works if the two hashtables don't share a key.

## Nested hashtables

We can use hashtables as values inside a hashtable.

```powershell
$person = @{
    name = 'Kevin'
    age  = 36
}
$person.location = @{}
$person.location.city = 'Austin'
$person.location.state = 'TX'
```

I started with a basic hashtable containing two keys. I added a key called `location` with an empty
hashtable. Then I added the last two items to that `location` hashtable. We can do this all inline
too.

```powershell
$person = @{
    name = 'Kevin'
    age  = 36
    location = @{
        city  = 'Austin'
        state = 'TX'
    }
}
```

This creates the same hashtable that we saw above and can access the properties the same way.

```powershell
$person.location.city
Austin
```powershell

There are many ways to approach the structure of your objects. Here is a second way to look at a
nested hashtable.

```powershell
$people = @{
    Kevin = @{
        age  = 36
        city = 'Austin'
    }
    Alex = @{
        age  = 9
        city = 'Austin'
    }
}
```

This mixes the concept of using hashtables as a collection of objects and a collection of
properties. The values are still easy to access even when they're nested using whatever approach
you prefer.

```powershell
PS> $people.kevin.age
36
PS> $people.kevin['city']
Austin
PS> $people['Alex'].age
9
PS> $people['Alex']['City']
Austin
```

I tend to use the dot property when I'm treating it like a property. Those are generally things I've
defined statically in my code and I know them off the top of my head. If I need to walk the list or
programmatically access the keys, I use the brackets to provide the key name.

```powershell
foreach($name in $people.keys)
{
    $person = $people[$name]
    '{0}, age {1}, is in {2}' -f $name, $person.age, $person.city
}
```

Having the ability to nest hashtables gives you a lot of flexibility and options.

### Looking at nested hashtables

As soon as you start nesting hashtables, you're going to need an easy way to look at them from the
console. If I take that last hashtable, I get an output that looks like this and it only goes so
deep:

```powershell
PS> $people
Name                           Value
----                           -----
Kevin                          {age, city}
Alex                           {age, city}
```

My go to command for looking at these things is `ConvertTo-JSON` because it's very clean and I
frequently use JSON on other things.

```powershell
PS> $people | ConvertTo-Json
{
    "Kevin":  {
                "age":  36,
                "city":  "Austin"
            },
    "Alex":  {
                "age":  9,
                "city":  "Austin"
            }
}
```

Even if you don't know JSON, you should be able to see what you're looking for. There's a
`Format-Custom` command for structured data like this but I still like the JSON view better.

## Creating objects

Sometimes you just need to have an object and using a hashtable to hold properties just isn't
getting the job done. Most commonly you want to see the keys as column names. A `pscustomobject`
makes that easy.

```powershell
$person = [pscustomobject]@{
    name = 'Kevin'
    age  = 36
}

$person

name  age
----  ---
Kevin  36
```

Even if you don't create it as a `pscustomobject` initially, you can always cast it later when
needed.

```powershell
$person = @{
    name = 'Kevin'
    age  = 36
}

[pscustomobject]$person

name  age
----  ---
Kevin  36
```

I already have detailed write-up for [pscustomobject][] that you should go read after this one. It
builds on a lot of the things learned here.

## Reading and writing hashtables to file

### Saving to CSV

Struggling with getting a hashtable to save to a CSV is one of the difficulties that I was referring
to above. Convert your hashtable to a `pscustomobject` and it will save correctly to CSV. It helps
if you start with a `pscustomobject` so the column order is preserved. But you can cast it to a
`pscustomobject` inline if needed.

```powershell
$person | ForEach-Object{ [pscustomobject]$_ } | Export-CSV -Path $path
```

Again, check out my write-up on using a [pscustomobject][].

### Saving a nested hashtable to file

If I need to save a nested hashtable to a file and then read it back in again, I use the JSON
cmdlets to do it.

```powershell
$people | ConvertTo-JSON | Set-Content -Path $path
$people = Get-Content -Path $path -Raw | ConvertFrom-JSON
```

There are two important points about this method. First is that the JSON is written out multiline so
I need to use the `-Raw` option to read it back into a single string. The Second is that the
imported object is no longer a `[hashtable]`. It's now a `[pscustomobject]` and that can cause
issues if you don't expect it.

If you need it to be a `[hashtable]` on import, then you need to use the `Export-CliXml` and
`Import-CliXml` commands.

### Converting JSON to Hashtable

If you need to convert JSON to a `[hashtable]`, there's one way that I know of to do it with the
[JavaScriptSerializer][] in .NET.

```powershell
[Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName("System.Web.Script.Serialization")
$JSSerializer = [System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer]::new()
$JSSerializer.Deserialize($json,'Hashtable')
```

### Reading directly from a file

If you have a file that contains a hashtable using PowerShell syntax, there's a way to import it
directly.

```powershell
$content = Get-Content -Path $Path -Raw -ErrorAction Stop
$scriptBlock = [scriptblock]::Create( $content )
$scriptBlock.CheckRestrictedLanguage( $allowedCommands, $allowedVariables, $true )
$hashtable = ( & $scriptBlock )
```

It imports the contents of the file into a `scriptblock`, then checks to make sure it doesn't have
any other PowerShell commands in it before it executes it.

On that note, did you know that a module manifest (the psd1 file) is just a hashtable?

## Keys are just strings

I didn't want to go off on this tangent earlier, but the keys are just strings. So we can put quotes
around anything and make it a key.

```powershell
$person = @{
    'full name' = 'Kevin Marquette'
    '#' = 3978
}
$person['full name']
```

You can do some odd things that you may not have realized you could do.

```powershell
$person.'full name'

$key = 'full name'
$person.$key
```

Just because you can do something, it doesn't mean that you should. That last one just looks like a
bug waiting to happen and would be easily misunderstood by anyone reading your code.

Technically your key doesn't have to be a string but they're easier to think about if you only use
strings.

## Use in automatic variables

### $PSBoundParameters

[$PSBoundParameters][] is an automatic variable that only exists inside the context of a function. It
contains all the parameters that the function was called with. This isn't exactly a hashtable but
close enough that you can treat it like one.

That includes removing keys and splatting it to other functions. If you find yourself writing proxy
functions, take a closer look at this one.

See [about_Automatic_Variables][] for more details.

### PSBoundParameters gotcha

One important thing to remember is that this only includes the values that are passed in as
parameters. If you also have parameters with default values but aren't passed in by the caller,
`$PSBoundParameters` doesn't contain those values. This is commonly overlooked.

### $PSDefaultParameterValues

This automatic variable lets you assign default values to any cmdlet without changing the cmdlet.
Take a look at this example.

```powershell
$PSDefaultParameterValues["Out-File:Encoding"] = "UTF8"
```

This adds an entry to the `$PSDefaultParameterValues` hashtable that sets `UTF8` as the default
value for the `Out-File -Encoding` parameter. This is session-specific so you should place it in
your `$profile`.

I use this often to pre-assign values that I type quite often.

```powershell
$PSDefaultParameterValues[ "Connect-VIServer:Server" ] = 'VCENTER01.contoso.local'
```

This also accepts wildcards so you can set values in bulk. Here are some ways you can use that:

```powershell
$PSDefaultParameterValues[ "Get-*:Verbose" ] = $true
$PSDefaultParameterValues[ "*:Credential" ] = Get-Credential
```

For a more in-depth breakdown, see this great article on [Automatic Defaults][] by
[Michael Sorens][].

## Regex $Matches

When you use the `-match` operator, an automatic variable called `$matches` is created with the
results of the match. If you have any sub expressions in your regex, those sub matches are also
listed.

```powershell
$message = 'My SSN is 123-45-6789.'

$message -match 'My SSN is (.+)\.'
$Matches[0]
$Matches[1]
```

### Named matches

This is one of my favorite features that most people don't know about. If you use a named regex
match, then you can access that match by name on the matches.

```powershell
$message = 'My Name is Kevin and my SSN is 123-45-6789.'

if($message -match 'My Name is (?<Name>.+) and my SSN is (?<SSN>.+)\.')
{
    $Matches.Name
    $Matches.SSN
}
```

In the example above, the `(?<Name>.*)` is a named sub expression. This value is then placed in the
`$Matches.Name` property.

## Group-Object -AsHashtable

One little known feature of `Group-Object` is that it can turn some datasets into a hashtable for
you.

```powershell
Import-CSV $Path | Group-Object -AsHashtable -Property email
```

This will add each row into a hashtable and use the specified property as the key to access it.

## Copying Hashtables

One important thing to know is that hashtables are objects. And each variable is just a reference to
an object. This means that it takes more work to make a valid copy of a hashtable.

### Assigning reference types

When you have one hashtable and assign it to a second variable, both variables point to the same
hashtable.

```powershell
PS> $orig = @{name='orig'}
PS> $copy = $orig
PS> $copy.name = 'copy'
PS> 'Copy: [{0}]' -f $copy.name
PS> 'Orig: [{0}]' -f $orig.name

Copy: [copy]
Orig: [copy]
```

This highlights that they're the same because altering the values in one will also alter the values
in the other. This also applies when passing hashtables into other functions. If those functions
make changes to that hashtable, your original is also altered.

### Shallow copies, single level

If we have a simple hashtable like our example above, we can use `.Clone()` to make a shallow copy.

```powershell
PS> $orig = @{name='orig'}
PS> $copy = $orig.Clone()
PS> $copy.name = 'copy'
PS> 'Copy: [{0}]' -f $copy.name
PS> 'Orig: [{0}]' -f $orig.name

Copy: [copy]
Orig: [orig]
```

This will allow us to make some basic changes to one that don't impact the other.

### Shallow copies, nested

The reason why it's called a shallow copy is because it only copies the base level properties. If
one of those properties is a reference type (like another hashtable), then those nested objects will
still point to each other.

```powershell
PS> $orig = @{
        person=@{
            name='orig'
        }
    }
PS> $copy = $orig.Clone()
PS> $copy.person.name = 'copy'
PS> 'Copy: [{0}]' -f $copy.person.name
PS> 'Orig: [{0}]' -f $orig.person.name

Copy: [copy]
Orig: [copy]
```

So you can see that even though I cloned the hashtable, the reference to `person` wasn't cloned. We
need to make a deep copy to truly have a second hashtable that isn't linked to the first.

### Deep copies

At the time of writing this, I'm not aware of any clever ways to just make a deep copy of a
hashtable (and keep it as a hashtable). That's just one of those things that someone needs to write.
Here is a quick method to do that.

```powershell
function Get-DeepClone
{
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        $InputObject
    )
    process
    {
        if($InputObject -is [hashtable]) {
            $clone = @{}
            foreach($key in $InputObject.keys)
            {
                $clone[$key] = Get-DeepClone $InputObject[$key]
            }
            return $clone
        } else {
            return $InputObject
        }
    }
}
```

It doesn't handle any other reference types or arrays, but it's a good starting point.

## Anything else?

I covered a lot of ground quickly. My hope is that you walk away leaning something new or
understanding it better every time you read this. Because I covered the full spectrum of this
feature, there are aspects that just may not apply to you right now. That is perfectly OK and is
kind of expected depending on how much you work with PowerShell.

Here is a list of everything we covered in case you want to jump back up to something. Normally,
this would go at the beginning but this was written from top to bottom with examples that build on
everything that came before it.
