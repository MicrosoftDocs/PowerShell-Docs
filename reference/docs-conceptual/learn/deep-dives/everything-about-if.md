# Everything you wanted to know about the IF statement

Like many other languages, PowerShell has statements for conditionally executing code in your
scripts. One of those statements is the [if][] statement. Today we will take a deep dive into one of
the most fundamental commands in PowerShell.

## Conditional execution

Your scripts often need to make decisions and perform different logic based on those decisions.
This is what I mean by conditional execution. You have one statement or value to evaluate, then
execute a different section of code based on that evaluation. This is exactly what the `if`
statement does.

## The if statement

Here is a basic example of the `if` statement:

```powershell
$condition = $true
if ( $condition )
{
    Write-Output "The condition was true"
}
```

The first thing the `if` statement does is evaluate the expression in parentheses. If it evaluates
to `$true`, then it executes the `scriptblock` in the braces. If the value was `$false`, then it
would skip over that scriptblock.

In the previous example, the `if` statement was just evaluating the `$condition` variable. It was
`$true` and would have executed the `Write-Output` command inside the scriptblock.

In some languages, you can place a single line of code after the `if` statement and it gets
executed. That isn't the case in PowerShell. You must provide a full `scriptblock` with braces for
it to work correctly.

## Comparison operators

The most common use of the `if` statement for is comparing two items with each other. PowerShell has
special operators for different comparison scenarios. When you use a comparison operator, the value
on the left-hand side is compared to the value on the right-hand side.

### -eq for equality

The `-eq` does an equality check between two values to make sure they're equal to each other.

```powershell
$value = Get-MysteryValue
if ( 5 -eq $value )
{
    # do something
}
```

In this example, I'm taking a known value of `5` and comparing it to my `$value` to see if they
match.

One possible use case is to check the status of a value before you take an action on it. You could
get a service and check that the status was running before you called `Restart-Service` on it.

It's common in other languages like C# to use `==` for equality (ex: `5 == $value`) but that doesn't
work with PowerShell. Another common mistake that people make is to use the equals sign (ex:
`5 = $value`) that is reserved for assigning values to variables. By placing your known value on the
left, it makes that mistaken more awkward to make.

This operator (and others) has a few variations.

- `-eq` case-insensitive equality
- `-ieq` case-insensitive equality
- `-ceq` case-sensitive equality

### -ne not equal

Many operators have a related operator that is checking for the opposite result. `-ne` verifies that
the values don't equal each other.

```powershell
if ( 5 -ne $value )
{
    # do something
}
```

Use this to make sure that the action only executes if the value isn't `5`. A good use-cases where
would be to check if a service was in the running state before you try to start it.

**Variations:**

- `-ne` case-insensitive not equal
- `-ine` case-insensitive not equal
- `-cne` case-sensitive not equal

These are inverse variations of `-eq`. I'll group these types together when I list variations
for other operators.

### -gt -ge -lt -le for greater than or less than

These operators are used when checking to see if a value is larger or smaller than another value.
The `-gt -ge -lt -le` stand for GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqual, LessThan, and LessThanOrEqual.

```powershell
if ( $value -gt 5 )
{
    # do something
}
```

**Variations:**

- `-gt` greater than
- `-igt` greater than, case-insensitive
- `-cgt` greater than, case-sensitive
- `-ge` greater than or equal
- `-ige` greater than or equal, case-insensitive
- `-cge` greater than or equal, case-sensitive
- `-lt` less than
- `-ilt` less than, case-insensitive
- `-clt` less than, case-sensitive
- `-le` less than or equal
- `-ile` less than or equal, case-insensitive
- `-cle` less than or equal, case-sensitive

I don't know why you would use case-sensitive and insensitive options for these operators.

### -like wildcard matches

PowerShell has its own wildcard-based pattern matching syntax and you can use it with the `-like`
operator. These wildcard patterns are fairly basic.

- `?` matches any single character
- `*` matches any number of characters

```powershell
$value = 'S-ATX-SQL01'
if ( $value -like 'S-*-SQL??')
{
    # do something
}
```

It's important to point out that the pattern matches the whole string. If you need to match
something in the middle of the string, you need to place the `*` on both ends of the
string.

```powershell
$value = 'S-ATX-SQL02'
if ( $value -like '*SQL*')
{
    # do something
}
```

**Variations:**

- `-like` case-insensitive wildcard
- `-ilike` case-insensitive wildcard
- `-clike` case-sensitive wildcard
- `-notlike` case-insensitive wildcard not matched
- `-inotlike` case-insensitive wildcard not matched
- `-cnotlike` case-sensitive wildcard not matched

### -match regular expression

The `-match` operator allows you to check a string for a regular-expression-based match. Use this
when the wildcard patterns aren't flexible enough for you.

```powershell
$value = 'S-ATX-SQL01'
if ( $value -match 'S-\w\w\w-SQL\d\d')
{
    # do something
}
```

A regex pattern matches anywhere in the string by default. So you can specify a substring that
you want matched like this:

```powershell
$value = 'S-ATX-SQL01'
if ( $value -match 'SQL')
{
    # do something
}
```

Regex is a complex language of its own and worth looking into. I talk more about `-match` and
[the many ways to use regex][] in another article.

**Variations:**

- `-match` case-insensitive regex
- `-imatch` case-insensitive regex
- `-cmatch` case-sensitive regex
- `-notmatch` case-insensitive regex not matched
- `-inotmatch` case-insensitive regex not matched
- `-cnotmatch` case-sensitive regex not matched

### -is of type

You can check a value's type with the `-is` operator.

```powershell
if ( $value -is [string] )
{
    # do something
}
```

You may use this if you're working with classes or accepting various objects over the pipeline. You
could have either a service or a service name as your input. Then check to see if you have a service
and fetch the service if you only have the name.

```powershell
if ( $Service -isnot [System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController] )
{
    $Service = Get-Service -Name $Service
}
```

**Variations:**

- `-is` of type
- `-isnot` not of type

## Collection operators

When you use the previous operators with a single value, the result is `$true` or `$false`. This is
handled slightly differently when working with a collection. Each item in the collection gets
evaluated and the operator returns every value that evaluates to `$true`.

```powershell
PS> 1,2,3,4 -eq 3
3
```

This still works correctly in a `if` statement. So a value is returned by your operator, then the
whole statement is `$true`.

```powershell
$array = 1..6
if ( $array -gt 3 )
{
    # do something
}
```

There's one small trap hiding in the details here that I need to point out. When using the `-ne`
operator this way, it's easy to mistakenly look at the logic backwards. Using `-ne` with a
collection returns `$true` if any item in the collection doesn't match your value.

```powershell
PS> 1,2,3 -ne 4
1
2
3
```

This may look like a clever trick, but we have operators `-contains` and `-in` that handle this more
efficiently. And `-notcontains` does what you expect.

### -contains

The `-contains` operator checks the collection for your value. As soon as it finds a match, it
returns `$true`.

```powershell
$array = 1..6
if ( $array -contains 3 )
{
    # do something
}
```

This is the preferred way to see if a collection contains your value. Using `Where-Object` (or
`-eq`) walks the entire list every time and is significantly slower.

**Variations:**

- `-contains` case-insensitive match
- `-icontains` case-insensitive match
- `-ccontains` case-sensitive match
- `-notcontains` case-insensitive not matched
- `-inotcontains` case-insensitive not matched
- `-cnotcontains` case-sensitive not matched

### -in

The `-in` operator is just like the `-contains` operator except the collection is on the right-hand
side.

```powershell
$array = 1..6
if ( 3 -in $array )
{
    # do something
}
```

**Variations:**

- `-in` case-insensitive match
- `-iin` case-insensitive match
- `-cin` case-sensitive match
- `-notin` case-insensitive not matched
- `-inotin` case-insensitive not matched
- `-cnotin` case-sensitive not matched

## Logical operators

Logical operators are used to invert or combine other expressions.

### -not

The `-not` operator flips an expression from `$false` to `$true` or from `$true` to `$false`. Here
is an example where we want to perform an action when `Test-Path` is `$false`.

```powershell
if ( -not ( Test-Path -Path $path ) )
```

Most of the operators we talked about do have a variation where you do not need to use the `-not`
operator. But there are still times it is useful.

### ! operator

You can use `!` as an alias for `-not`.

```powershell
if ( -not $value ){}
if ( !$value ){}
```

You may see `!` used more by people that come from another languages like C#. I prefer to type it
out because I find it hard to see when quickly looking at my scripts.

### -and

You can combine expressions with the `-and` operator. When you do that, both sides need to be
`$true` for the whole expression to be `$true`.

```powershell
if ( ($age -gt 13) -and ($age -lt 55) )
```

In that example, `$age` must be 13 or older for the left side and less than 55 for the right side. I
added extra parentheses to make it clearer in that example but they're optional as long as the
expression is simple. Here is the same example without them.

```powershell
if ( $age -gt 13 -and $age -lt 55 )
```

Evaluation happens from left to right. If the first item evaluates to `$false`, it exits early and
doesn't perform the right comparison. This is handy when you need to make sure a value exists before
you use it. For example, `Test-Path` throws an error if you give it a `$null` path.

```powershell
if ( $null -ne $path -and (Test-Path -Path $path) )
```

### -or

The `-or` allows for you to specify two expressions and returns `$true` if either one of them is
`$true`.

```powershell
if ( $age -le 13 -or $age -ge 55 )
```

Just like with the `-and` operator, the evaluation happens from left to right. Except that if the
first part is `$true`, then the whole statement is `$true` and it doesn't process the rest of the
expression.

Also make note of how the syntax works for these operators. You need two separate expressions. I
have seen users try to do something like this `$value -eq 5 -or 6` without realizing their mistake.

### -xor exclusive or

This one is a little unusual. `-xor` allows only one expression to evaluate to `$true`. So if both
items are `$false` or both items are `$true`, then the whole expression is `$false`. Another way to
look at this is the expression is only `$true` when the results of the expression are different.

It's rare that anyone would ever use this logical operator and I can't think up a good example as to
why I would ever use it.

## Bitwise operators

Bitwise operators perform calculations on the bits within the values and produce a new value as the
result. Teaching [bitwise operators][] is beyond the scope of this article, but here is the list the
them.

- `-band` binary AND
- `-bor` binary OR
- `-bxor` binary exclusive OR
- `-bnot` binary NOT
- `-shl` shift left
- `-shr` shift right

## PowerShell expressions

We can use normal PowerShell inside the condition statement.

```powershell
if ( Test-Path -Path $Path )
```

`Test-Path` returns `$true` or `$false` when it executes. This also applies to commands that return
other values.

```powershell
if ( Get-Process Notepad* )
```

It evaluates to `$true` if there's a returned process and `$false` if there'sn'thing. It's
perfectly valid to use pipeline expressions or other PowerShell statements like this:

```powershell
if ( Get-Process | Where Name -eq Notepad )
```

These expressions can be combined with each other with the `-and` and `-or` operators, but you may
have to use parenthesis to break them into subexpressions.

```powershell
if ( (Get-Process) -and (Get-Service) )
```

### Checking for $null

Having a no result or a `$null` value evaluates to `$false` in the `if` statement. When checking
specifically for `$null`, it's a best practice to place the `$null` on the left-hand side.

```powershell
if ( $null -eq $value )
```

There are quite a few nuances when dealing with `$null` values in PowerShell. If you're interested
in diving deeper, I have an article about [everything you wanted to know about $null][].

### Variable assignment

I almost forgot to add this one until [Prasoon Karunan V][] reminded me of it.

```powershell
if ($process=Get-Process notepad -ErrorAction ignore) {$process} else {$false}
```

Normally when you assign a value to a variable, the value isn't passed onto the pipeline or
console. When you do a variable assignment in a sub expression, it does get passed on to the
pipeline.

```powershell
PS> $first = 1
PS> ($second = 2)
2
```

See how the `$first` assignment has no output and the `$second` assignment does? When an assignment
is done in an `if` statement, it executes just like the `$second` assignment above. Here is a clean
example on how you could use it:

```powershell
if ( $process = Get-Process Notepad* )
{
    $process | Stop-Process
}
```

If `$process` gets assigned a value, then the statement is `$true` and `$process` gets stopped.

Make sure you don't confuse this with `-eq` because this isn't an equality check. This is a more
obscure feature that most people don't realize works this way.

## Alternate execution path

The `if` statement allows you to specify an action for not only when the statement is `$true`, but
also for when it's `$false`. This is where the `else` statement comes into play.

### else

The `else` statement is always the last part of the `if` statement when used.

```powershell
if ( Test-Path -Path $Path -PathType Leaf )
{
    Move-Item -Path $Path -Destination $archivePath
}
else
{
    Write-Warning "$path doesn't exist or isn't a file."
}
```

In this example, we check the `$path` to make sure it's a file. If we find the file, we move it. If
not, we write a warning. This type of branching logic is very common.

### Nested if

The `if` and `else` statements take a script block, so we can place any PowerShell command inside
them, including another `if` statement. This allows you to make use of much more complicated logic.

```powershell
if ( Test-Path -Path $Path -PathType Leaf )
{
    Move-Item -Path $Path -Destination $archivePath
}
else
{
    if ( Test-Path -Path $Path )
    {
        Write-Warning "A file was required but a directory was found instead."
    }
    else
    {
        Write-Warning "$path could not be found."
    }
}
```

In this example, we test the happy path first and then take action on it. If that fails, we do
another check and to provide more detailed information to the user.

### elseif

We aren't limited to just a single conditional check. We can chain `if` and `else` statements
together instead of nesting them by using the `elseif` statement.

```powershell
if ( Test-Path -Path $Path -PathType Leaf )
{
    Move-Item -Path $Path -Destination $archivePath
}
elseif ( Test-Path -Path $Path )
{
    Write-Warning "A file was required but a directory was found instead."
}
else
{
    Write-Warning "$path could not be found."
}
```

The execution happens from the top to the bottom. The top `if` statement is evaluated first. If that
is `$false`, then it moves down to the next `elseif` or `else` in the list. That last `else` is the
default action to take if none of the others return `$true`.

### switch

At this point, I need to mention the `switch` statement. It provides an alternate syntax for doing
multiple comparisons with a value. With the `switch`, you specify an expression and that result gets
compared with several different values. If one of those values match, the matching code block is
executed. Take a look at this example:

```powershell
$itemType = 'Role'
switch ( $itemType )
{
    'Component'
    {
        'is a component'
    }
    'Role'
    {
        'is a role'
    }
    'Location'
    {
        'is a location'
    }
}
```

There three possible values that can match the `$itemType`. In this case, it matches with `Role`. I
used a simple example just to give you some exposure to the `switch` operator. I talk more
about [everything you ever wanted to know about the switch statement][] in another article.

## Pipeline

The pipeline is a unique and important feature of PowerShell. Any value that isn't suppressed
or assigned to a variable gets placed in the pipeline. The `if` provides us a way to take advantage
of the pipeline in a way that isn't always obvious.

```powershell
$discount = if ( $age -ge 55 )
{
    Get-SeniorDiscount
}
elseif ( $age -le 13 )
{
    Get-ChildDiscount
}
else
{
    0.00
}
```

Each script block is placing the results the commands or the value into the pipeline. Then we assign
the result of the if statement to the `$discount` variable. That example could have just as easily
assigned those values to the `$discount` variable directly in each scriptblock. I can't say that I
use this with the `if` statement often, but I do have an example where I used this recently.

### Array inline

I have a function called [Invoke-SnowSql][] that launches an executable with several command-line
arguments. Here is a clip from that function where I build the array of arguments.

```powershell
$snowSqlParam = @(
    '--accountname', $Endpoint
    '--username', $Credential.UserName
    '--option', 'exit_on_error=true'
    '--option', 'output_format=csv'
    '--option', 'friendly=false'
    '--option', 'timing=false'
    if ($Debug)
    {
        '--option', 'log_level=DEBUG'
    }
    if ($Path)
    {
        '--filename', $Path
    }
    else
    {
        '--query', $singleLineQuery
    }
)
```

The `$Debug` and `$Path` variables are parameters on the function that are provided by the end user.
I evaluate them inline inside the initialization of my array. If `$Debug` is true, then those values
fall into the `$snowSqlParam` in the correct place. Same holds true for the `$Path` variable.

## Simplify complex operations

It's inevitable that you run into a situation that has way too many comparisons to check and your
if statement scrolls way off the right side of the screen.

```powershell
$user = Get-ADUser -Identity $UserName
if ( $null -ne $user -and $user.Department -eq 'Finance' -and $user.Title -match 'Senior' -and $user.HomeDrive -notlike '\\server\*' )
{
    # Do Something
}
```

They can be hard to read and that make you more prone to make mistakes. There are a few things we
can do about that.

### Line continuation

There some operators in PowerShell that let you wrap you command to the next line. The logical
operators `-and` and `-or` are good operators to use if you want to break your expression into
multiple lines.

```powershell
if ($null -ne $user -and
    $user.Department -eq 'Finance' -and
    $user.Title -match 'Senior' -and
    $user.HomeDrive -notlike '\\server\*'
)
{
    # Do Something
}
```

There's still a lot going on there, but placing each piece on its own line makes a big difference.
I generally use this when I get more than two comparisons or if I have to scroll to the right to
read any of the logic.

### Pre-calculating results

We can take that statement out of the if statement and only check the result.

```powershell
$needsSecureHomeDrive = $null -ne $user -and
    $user.Department -eq 'Finance' -and
    $user.Title -match 'Senior' -and
    $user.HomeDrive -notlike '\\server\*'

if ( $needsSecureHomeDrive )
{
    # Do Something
}
```

This just feels much cleaner than the previous example. You also are given an opportunity to use a
variable name that explains what it's that you're really checking. This is also and example of
self-documenting code that saves unnecessary comments.

### Multiple if statements

We can break this up into multiple statements and check them one at a time. In this case, we use a
flag or a tracking variable to combine the results.

```powershell

$skipUser = $false

if( $null -eq $user )
{
    $skipUser = $true
}

if( $user.Department -ne 'Finance' )
{
    Write-Verbose "isn't in Finance department"
    $skipUser = $true
}

if( $user.Title -match 'Senior' )
{
    Write-Verbose "Doesn't have Senior title"
    $skipUser = $true
}

if( $user.HomeDrive -like '\\server\*' )
{
    Write-Verbose "Home drive already configured"
    $skipUser = $true
}

if ( -not $skipUser )
{
    # do something
}
```

I did have to invert the logic to make the flag logic work correctly. Each evaluation is an
individual `if` statement. The advantage of this is that when you're debugging, you can tell
exactly what the logic is doing. I was able to add much better verbosity at the same time.

The obvious downside is that it's so much more code to write. The code is more complex to look at
as it takes a single line of logic and explodes it into 25 or more lines.

### Using functions

We can also move all that validation logic into a function. Look at how clean this looks at a
glance.

```powershell
if ( Test-SecureDriveConfiguration -ADUser $user )
{
    # do something
}
```

You still have to create the function to do the validation, but it makes this code much easier to
work with. It makes this code easier to test. In your tests, you can mock the call to
`Test-ADDriveConfiguration` and you only need two tests for this function. One where it returns
`$true` and one where it returns `$false`. Testing the other function is simpler because it's
so small.

The body of that function could still be that one-liner we started with or the exploded logic that
we used in the last section. This works well for both scenarios and allows you to easily change that
implementation later.

## Error handling

One important use of the `if` statement is to check for error conditions before you run into
errors. A good example is to check if a folder already exists before you try to create it.

```powershell
if ( -not (Test-Path -Path $folder) )
{
    New-Item -Type Directory -Path $folder
}
```

I like to say that if you expect an exception to happen, then it's not really an exception. So check
your values and validate your conditions where you can.

If you want to dive a little more into actual exception handling, I have an article on
[everything you ever wanted to know about exceptions][].

## Final words

The `if` statement is such a simple statement but is a fundamental piece of PowerShell. You will
find yourself using this multiple times in almost every script you write. I hope you have a better
understanding than you had before.
