# Deep dive articles

The articles in this section are designed to be an in-depth look into PowerShell topics. These
articles don't replace the reference articles, but provide diverse examples, illustrate edge
cases, and warn about pitfalls and common mistakes.

This collection is also a showcase for community contributions. The inaugural set of articles come
from [@KevinMarquette][] and were originally published at [PowerShellExplained.com][].
