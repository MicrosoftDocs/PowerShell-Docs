# Using Experimental Features in PowerShell

The Experimental Features support in PowerShell provides a mechanism for experimental features to
coexist with existing stable features in PowerShell or PowerShell modules.

An experimental feature is one where the design isn't finalized. The feature is available for users
to test and provide feedback. Once an experimental feature is finalized, the design changes become
breaking changes.

> [!CAUTION]
> Experimental features aren't intended to be used in production since the changes are allowed to be
> breaking. Experimental features aren't officially supported. However, we appreciate any feedback
> and bug reports. You can file issues in the [GitHub source repository][09].

For more information about enabling or disabling these features, see
[about_Experimental_Features][06].

## PSAMSIMethodInvocationLogging

> [!NOTE]

This experiment was added in PowerShell 7.3.

For more information about AMSI, see [How AMSI helps][08].

## PSAnsiRenderingFileInfo

> [!NOTE]
> This feature became mainstream in PowerShell 7.3.

This experiment was added in PowerShell 7.2. This feature adds the $PSStyle.FileInfo member and
enables coloring of specific file types.

- `$PSStyle.FileInfo.Directory` - Built-in member to specify color for directories
- `$PSStyle.FileInfo.SymbolicLink` - Built-in member to specify color for symbolic links
- `$PSStyle.FileInfo.Executable` - Built-in member to specify color for executables.
- `$PSStyle.FileInfo.Extension` - Use this member to define colors for different file extensions.
  The **Extension** member pre-includes extensions for archive and PowerShell files.

For more information, see [about_Automatic_Variables][05].

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is dependent on the **PSAnsiRendering** feature that's now a standard feature.

## PSCommandNotFoundSuggestion

Recommends potential commands based on fuzzy matching search after a **CommandNotFoundException**.

```powershell
PS> get
```

```Output
get: The term 'get' isn't recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file,
or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify
that the path is correct and try again.

Suggestion [4,General]: The most similar commands are: set, del, ft, gal, gbp, gc, gci,
gcm, gdr, gcs.
```

## PSCustomTableHeaderLabelDecoration

When this feature is enabled, `$PSStyle` includes formatting differentiation for table header labels
that aren't property members. For example, the default output from `Get-Process` includes the
following columns: `NPM(K)`, `PM(M)`, `WS(M)`, and `CPU(s)`.

```powershell
Get-Process pwsh
```

```Output
 NPM(K)    PM(M)      WS(M)     CPU(s)      Id  SI ProcessName
 ------    -----      -----     ------      --  -- -----------
     99    84.57     170.50       5.89   48688   1 pwsh
     73    87.75     133.08       3.09   49120   1 pwsh
     98    70.31     158.56       4.23   91220   1 pwsh
    125    70.19     171.33       4.84   92124   1 pwsh
```

These column names don't match any properties of the **System.Diagnostics.Process** object returned
by the cmdlet. These are values calculated by the PowerShell formatting system.

With this feature enabled these column headers are displayed in italics to distinguish these column
names from property names.

## PSDesiredStateConfiguration.InvokeDscResource

Enables compilation to MOF on non-Windows systems and enables the use of `Invoke-DSCResource`
without an LCM.

In earlier previews of PowerShell 7.2, this feature was enabled by default. Beginning with
PowerShell 7.2, the **PSDesiredStateConfiguration** module was removed and this feature is disabled
by default. To enable this feature you must install the **PSDesiredStateConfiguration** v2.0.5
module from the PowerShell Gallery and enable the feature using `Enable-ExperimentalFeature`.

DSC v3 doesn't have this experimental feature. DSC v3 only supports `Invoke-DSCResource` and doesn't
use or support MOF compilation. For more information, see
[PowerShell Desired State Configuration v3][04].

## PSFeedbackProvider

Replace the hard-coded suggestion framework with the extensible feedback provider.

## PSLoadAssemblyFromNativeCode

Exposes an API to allow assembly loading from native code.

## PSModuleAutoLoadSkipOfflineFiles

With this feature enabled, if a user's **PSModulePath** contains a folder from a cloud provider,
such as OneDrive, PowerShell no longer triggers the download of all files contained within that
folder. Any file marked as not downloaded are skipped. Users who use cloud providers to sync their
modules between machines should mark the module folder as **Pinned** or the equivalent status for
providers other than OneDrive. Marking the module folder as **Pinned** ensures that the files are
always kept on disk.

## PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing

> [!NOTE]
> This feature became mainstream in PowerShell 7.3.

When this experimental feature is enabled PowerShell uses the `ArgumentList` property of the
`StartProcessInfo` object rather than our current mechanism of reconstructing a string when invoking
a native executable.

> [!CAUTION]
> The new behavior is a **breaking change** from current behavior. This may break scripts and
> automation that work around the various issues when invoking native applications. Historically,
> quotes must be escaped and it isn't possible to provide empty arguments to a native application.
>
> Use the [stop-parsing token][07] (`--%`) or the [`Start-Process`][12] cmdlet to sidestep native
> argument passing when needed.

This feature adds a new automatic variable `$PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing` that allows you to
select the behavior at runtime. The valid values are `Legacy`, `Standard`, and `Windows`. `Legacy`
is the historic behavior. The default when the experimental feature is enabled is the new `Standard`
behavior.

When the preference variable is set to `Windows`, invocations of the following files automatically
use the `Legacy` style argument passing.

- `cmd.exe`
- `find.exe`
- `cscript.exe`
- `wscript.exe`
- `sqlcmd.exe` - Added in PowerShell 7.3.1
- ending with `.bat`
- ending with `.cmd`
- ending with `.js`
- ending with `.vbs`
- ending with `.wsf`

If the `$PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing` is set to either `Legacy` or `Standard`, the check for
these files doesn't occur. The default behavior is platform specific. On Windows platforms, the
default setting is `Windows` and non-Windows platforms is `Standard`.

New behaviors made available by this change:

- Literal or expandable strings with embedded quotes the quotes are now preserved:

  ```powershell
  PS > $a = 'a" "b'
  PS > $PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing = "Legacy"
  PS > testexe -echoargs $a 'a" "b' a" "b
  Arg 0 is <a b>
  Arg 1 is <a b>
  Arg 2 is <a b>
  PS > $PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing = "Standard"
  PS > testexe -echoargs $a 'a" "b' a" "b
  Arg 0 is <a" "b>
  Arg 1 is <a" "b>
  Arg 2 is <a b>
  ```

- Empty strings as arguments are now preserved:

  ```powershell
  PS>  $PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing = "Legacy"
  PS> testexe -echoargs '' a b ''
  Arg 0 is <a>
  Arg 1 is <b>
  PS> $PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing = "Standard"
  PS> testexe -echoargs '' a b ''
  Arg 0 is <>
  Arg 1 is <a>
  Arg 2 is <b>
  Arg 3 is <>
  ```

The new behavior doesn't change invocations that look like this:

```powershell
PS> $PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing = "Legacy"
PS> testexe -echoargs -k com:port=\\devbox\pipe\debug,pipe,resets=0,reconnect
Arg 0 is <-k>
Arg 1 is <com:port=\\devbox\pipe\debug,pipe,resets=0,reconnect>
PS> $PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing = "Standard"
PS> testexe -echoargs -k com:port=\\devbox\pipe\debug,pipe,resets=0,reconnect
Arg 0 is <-k>
Arg 1 is <com:port=\\devbox\pipe\debug,pipe,resets=0,reconnect>
```

Additionally, parameter tracing is now provided so `Trace-Command` provides useful information
for debugging.

```powershell
PS> $PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing = "Legacy"
PS> trace-command -PSHOST -Name ParameterBinding { testexe -echoargs $a 'a" "b' a" "b }
DEBUG: 2021-02-01 17:19:53.6438 ParameterBinding Information: 0 : BIND NAMED native application line args [/Users/james/src/github/forks/jameswtruher/PowerShell-1/test/tools/TestExe/bin/testexe]

```

## PSNativeCommandErrorActionPreference

Native commands usually return an exit code to the calling application that's zero for success or
non-zero for failure. However, native commands currently don't participate in the PowerShell error
stream. Redirected **stderr** output isn't interpreted the same as the PowerShell error stream. Many
native commands use stderr as an information or verbose stream, thus only the exit code matters.
Users working with native commands in their scripts need to check the exit status after each call
using similar to the following example:

```powershell
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) {
    throw "Command failed. See above errors for details"
}
```

However, this example doesn't support all cases where `$?` can be false from a cmdlet or function
error, making `$LASTEXITCODE` stale.

This feature implements the `$PSNativeCommandUseErrorActionPreference` preference variable that
controls how native commands errors are handled in PowerShell. This allows native command failures
to produce error objects that are added to the PowerShell error stream and may terminate execution
of the script without extra handling.

To enable this feature, run the following commands:

```powershell
Enable-ExperimentalFeature PSNativeCommandErrorActionPreference
```

You must start a new PowerShell session for this change to be in effect. Beginning in PowerShell
7.4, `$PSNativeCommandUseErrorActionPreference` is set to `$true` by default. With the preference
set to `$true` you get the following behavior:

- When `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`, scripts will break when a native command returns a
  non-zero exit code.
- When `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue'` (the default), you will see PowerShell error messages
  for native command errors, but scripts won't break.

## PSNativePSPathResolution

> [!NOTE]
> This experimental feature was removed in PowerShell 7.3 and is no longer supported.

If a PSDrive path that uses the FileSystem provider is passed to a native command, the resolved file
path is passed to the native command. This means a command like `code temp:/test.txt` now works as
expected.

Also, on Windows, if the path starts with `~`, that's resolved to the full path and passed to the
native command. In both cases, the path is normalized to the directory separators for the relevant
operating system.

- If the path isn't a PSDrive or `~` (on Windows), then path normalization doesn't occur
- If the path is in single quotes, then it's not resolved and treated as literal

## PSSubsystemPluginModel

This feature enables the subsystem plugin model in PowerShell. The feature makes it possible to
separate components of `System.Management.Automation.dll` into individual subsystems that reside in
their own assembly. This separation reduces the disk footprint of the core PowerShell engine and
allows these components to become optional features for a minimal PowerShell installation.

Currently, only the **CommandPredictor** subsystem is supported. This subsystem is used along with
the PSReadLine module to provide custom prediction plugins. In future, **Job**,
**CommandCompleter**, **Remoting** and other components could be separated into subsystem assemblies
outside of `System.Management.Automation.dll`.

The experimental feature includes a new cmdlet, [Get-PSSubsystem][11]. This cmdlet is only available
when the feature is enabled. This cmdlet returns information about the subsystems that are available
on the system.
