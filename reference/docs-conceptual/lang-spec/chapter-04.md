# 4. Types

In PowerShell, each value has a type, and types fall into one of two main categories: *value types*
and *reference types*. Consider the type `int`, which is typical of value types. A value of type
`int` is completely self-contained; all the bits needed to represent that value are stored in that
value, and every bit pattern in that value represents a valid value for its type. Now, consider the
array type `int[]`, which is typical of reference types. A so-called value of an array type can hold
either a reference to an object that actually contains the array elements, or the *null reference*
whose value is `$null`. The important distinction between the two type categories is best
demonstrated by the differences in their semantics during assignment. For example,

```powershell
$i = 100 # $i designates an int value 100
$j = $i # $j designates an int value 100, which is a copy

$a = 10,20,30 # $a designates an object[], Length 3, value 10,20,30
$b = $a # $b designates exactly the same array as does $a, not a copy
$a[1] = 50 # element 1 (which has a value type) is changed from 20 to 50
$b[1] # $b refers to the same array as $a, so $b[1] is 50
```

As we can see, the assignment of a reference type value involves a *shallow copy*; that is, a copy
of the reference to the object rather than its actual value. In contrast, a *deep copy* requires
making a copy of the object as well.

A *numeric* type is one that allows representation of integer or fractional values, and that
supports arithmetic operations on those values. The set of numerical types includes the integer
([§4.2.3][]) and real number ([§4.2.4][]) types, but does not include bool ([§4.2.1][]) or char
([§4.2.2][]). An implementation may provide other numeric types (such as signed byte, unsigned
integer, and integers of other sizes).

A *collection* is a group of one or more related items, which need not have the same type. Examples
of collection types are arrays, stacks, queues, lists, and hash tables. A program can *enumerate*
(or *iterate*) over the elements in a collection, getting access to each element one at a time.
Common ways to do this are with the foreach statement ([§8.4.4][]) and the
[ForEach-Object](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Core.ForEach-Object) cmdlet. The type of an object that
represents an enumerator is described in [§4.5.16][].

In this chapter, there are tables that list the accessible members for a given type. For methods,
the **Type** is written with the following form: *returnType*/*argumentTypeList*. If the argument
type list is too long to fit in that column, it is shown in the **Purpose** column instead.

Other integer types are `SByte`, `Int16`, `UInt16`, `UInt32`, and `UInt64`, all in the namespace
**System**.

Many collection classes are defined as part of the **System.Collections** or
**System.Collections.Generic** namespaces. Most collection classes implement the interfaces
`ICollection`, `IComparer`, `IEnumerable`, `IList`, `IDictionary`, and `IDictionaryEnumerator` and
their generic equivalents.

## 4.1 Special types

### 4.1.1 The void type

This type cannot be instantiated. It provides a means to discard a value explicitly using the cast
operator ([§7.2.9][]).

### 4.1.2 The null type

The *null type* has one instance, the automatic variable $null ([§2.3.2.2][]), also known as the
null value. This value provides a means for expressing "nothingness" in reference contexts. The
characteristics of this type are unspecified.

### 4.1.3 The object type

Every type in PowerShell except the null type ([§4.1.2][]) is derived directly or indirectly from
the type object, so object is the ultimate base type of all non-null types. A variable constrained
([§5.3][]) to type object is really not constrained at all, as it can contain a value of any type.

## 4.2 Value types

### 4.2.1 Boolean

The Boolean type is `bool`. There are only two values of this type, Fal****se and **True**,
represented by the automatic variables `$false` and `$true`, respectively ([§2.3.2.2][]).

In PowerShell, `bool` maps to `System.Boolean`.

### 4.2.2 Character

A character value has type char, which is capable of storing any UTF-16-encoded 16-bit Unicode code
point.

The type char has the following accessible members:

|   **Member**    |       **Member Kind**       |  **Type**   |                          **Purpose**                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MaxValue        | Static property (read-only) | char        | The largest possible value of type char                        |
| MinValue        | Static property (read-only) | char        | The smallest possible value of type char                       |
| IsControl       | Static method               | bool/char   | Tests if the character is a control character                  |
| IsDigit         | Static method               | bool/char   | Tests if the character is a decimal digit                      |
| IsLetter        | Static method               | bool/char   | Tests if the character is an alphabetic letter                 |
| IsLetterOrDigit | Static method               | bool/char   | Tests if the character is a decimal digit or alphabetic letter |
| IsLower         | Static method               | bool/char   | Tests if the character is a lowercase alphabetic letter        |
| IsPunctuation   | Static method               | bool/char   | Tests if the character is a punctuation mark                   |
| IsUpper         | Static method               | bool/char   | Tests if the character is an uppercase alphabetic letter       |
| IsWhiteSpace    | Static method               | bool/char   | Tests if the character is a white space character.             |
| ToLower         | Static method               | char/string | Converts the character to lowercase                            |
| ToUpper         | Static method               | char/string | Converts the character to uppercase                            |

Windows PowerShell: char maps to System.Char.

### 4.2.3 Integer

There are two signed integer types, both of use two's-complement
representation for negative values:

- Type `int`, which uses 32 bits giving it a range of -2147483648 to +2147483647, inclusive.
- Type `long`, which uses 64 bits giving it a range of -9223372036854775808 to +9223372036854775807,
  inclusive.

Type int has the following accessible members:

| **Member** |       **Member Kind**       | **Type** |               **Purpose**               |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| MaxValue   | Static property (read-only) | int      | The largest possible value of type int  |
| MinValue   | Static property (read-only) | int      | The smallest possible value of type int |

Type long has the following accessible members:

| **Member** |       **Member Kind**       | **Type** |               **Purpose**                |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| MaxValue   | Static property (read-only) | long     | The largest possible value of type long  |
| MinValue   | Static property (read-only) | long     | The smallest possible value of type long |

There is one unsigned integer type:

- Type `byte`, which uses 8 bits giving it a range of 0 to 255, inclusive.

Type `byte` has the following accessible members:

| **Member** |       **Member Kind**       | **Type** |               **Purpose**                |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| MaxValue   | Static property (read-only) | byte     | The largest possible value of type byte  |
| MinValue   | Static property (read-only) | byte     | The smallest possible value of type byte |

In PowerShell, `byte`, `int`, and `long` map to `System.Byte`, `System.Int32`, and `System.Int64`,
respectively.

### 4.2.4 Real number

#### 4.2.4.1 float and double

There are two real (or floating-point) types:

- Type `float` uses the 32-bit IEEE single-precision representation.
- Type `double` uses the 64-bit IEEE double-precision representation.

A third type name, `single`, is a synonym for type `float`; `float` is used throughout this
specification.

Although the size and representation of the types `float` and `double` are defined by this
specification, an implementation may use extended precision for intermediate results.

Type float has the following accessible members:

|    **Member**    |       **Member Kind**       | **Type** |                **Purpose**                |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| MaxValue         | Static property (read-only) | float    | The largest possible value of type float  |
| MinValue         | Static property (read-only) | float    | The smallest possible value of type float |
| NaN              | Static property (read-only) | float    | The constant value Not-a-Number           |
| NegativeInfinity | Static property (read-only) | float    | The constant value negative infinity      |
| PositiveInfinity | Static property (read-only) | float    | The constant value positive infinity      |

Type double has the following accessible members:

|    **Member**    |       **Member Kind**       | **Type** |                **Purpose**                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| MaxValue         | Static property (read-only) | double   | The largest possible value of type double  |
| MinValue         | Static property (read-only) | double   | The smallest possible value of type double |
| NaN              | Static property (read-only) | double   | The constant value Not-a-Number            |
| NegativeInfinity | Static property (read-only) | double   | The constant value negative infinity       |
| PositiveInfinity | Static property (read-only) | double   | The constant value positive infinity       |

In PowerShell, `float` and `double` map to `System.Single` and `System.Double`, respectively.

#### 4.2.4.2 decimal

Type decimal uses a 128-bit representation. At a minimum it must support a scale *s* such that 0 <=
*s* <= at least 28, and a value range -79228162514264337593543950335 to
79228162514264337593543950335. The actual representation of decimal is implementation defined.

Type decimal has the following accessible members:

| **Member** |       **Member Kind**       | **Type** |                 **Purpose**                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| MaxValue   | Static property (read-only) | decimal  | The largest possible value of type decimal  |
| MinValue   | Static property (read-only) | decimal  | The smallest possible value of type decimal |

> [!NOTE]

> Decimal real numbers have a characteristic called *scale*, which represents the number of digits
> to the right of the decimal point. For example, the value 2.340 has a scale of 3 where trailing
> zeros are significant. When two decimal real numbers are added or subtracted, the scale of the
> result is the larger of the two scales. For example, 1.0 + 2.000 is 3.000, while 5.0 - 2.00 is
> 3.00. When two decimal real numbers are multiplied, the scale of the result is the sum of the two
> scales. For example, 1.0 * 2.000 is 2.0000. When two decimal real numbers are divided, the scale
> of the result is the scale of the first less the scale of the second. For example, 4.00000/2.000
> is 2.00. However, a scale cannot be less than that needed to preserve the correct result. For
> example, 3.000/2.000, 3.00/2.000, 3.0/2.000, and 3/2 are all 1.5.

In PowerShell, `decimal` maps to `System.Decimal`. The representation of decimal is as follows:

- When considered as an array of four `int` values it contains the following elements:
  - Index 0 (bits 0‑31) contains the low-order 32 bits of the decimal's coefficient.
  - Index 1 (bits 32‑63) contains the middle 32 bits of the decimal's coefficient.
  - Index 2 (bits 64‑95) contains the high-order 32 bits of the decimal's coefficient.
  - Index 3 (bits 96‑127) contains the sign bit and scale, as follows:
    - bits 0--15 are zero
    - bits 16‑23 contains the scale as a value 0--28
    - bits 24‑30 are zero
    - bit 31 is the sign (0 for positive, 1 for negative)

### 4.2.5 The switch type

This type is used to constrain the type of a parameter in a command ([§8.10.5][]). If an argument
having the corresponding parameter name is present the parameter tests $true; otherwise, it tests
`$false`.

In PowerShell, `switch` maps to `System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter`.

### 4.2.6 Enumeration types

An enumeration type is one that defines a set of named constants representing all the possible
values that can be assigned to an object of that enumeration type. In some cases, the set of values
are such that only one value can be represented at a time. In other cases, the set of values are
distinct powers of two, and by using the -bor operator ([§7.8.5][]), multiple values can be encoded
in the same object.

The PowerShell environment provides a number of enumeration types, as described in the following
sections.

#### 4.2.6.1 Action-Preference type

This implementation-defined type has the following mutually
exclusive-valued accessible members:

|    **Member**    |   **Member Kind**    |                                               **Purpose**                                               |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Continue         | Enumeration constant | The PowerShell runtime will continue processing and notify the user that an action has occurred.        |
| Inquire          | Enumeration constant | The PowerShell runtime will stop processing and ask the user how it should proceed.                     |
| SilentlyContinue | Enumeration constant | The PowerShell runtime will continue processing without notifying the user that an action has occurred. |
| Stop             | Enumeration constant | The PowerShell runtime will stop processing when an action occurs.                                      |

In PowerShell, this type is `System.Management.Automation.ActionPreference`.

#### 4.2.6.2 Confirm-Impact type

This implementation-defined type has the following mutually exclusive-valued accessible members:

| **Member** |   **Member Kind**    |                                      **Purpose**                                       |
| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High       | Enumeration constant | The action performed has a high risk of losing data, such as reformatting a hard disk. |
| Low        | Enumeration constant | The action performed has a low risk of losing data.                                    |
| Medium     | Enumeration constant | The action performed has a medium risk of losing data.                                 |
| None       | Enumeration constant | Do not confirm any actions (suppress all requests for confirmation).                   |

In PowerShell, this type is `System.Management.Automation.ConfirmImpact`.

#### 4.2.6.3 File-Attributes type

This implementation-defined type has the following accessible members, which can be combined:

|    **Member**     |   **Member Kind**    |                                                                                                                  **Purpose**                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Archive           | Enumeration constant | The file's archive status. Applications use this attribute to mark files for backup or removal.                                                                                                                                               |
| Compressed        | Enumeration constant | The file is compressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Device            |                      | Reserved for future use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Directory         | Enumeration constant | The file is a directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Encrypted         | Enumeration constant | The file or directory is encrypted. For a file, this means that all data in the file is encrypted. For a directory, this means that encryption is the default for newly created files and directories.                                        |
| Hidden            | Enumeration constant | The file is hidden, and thus is not included in an ordinary directory listing.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Normal            | Enumeration constant | The file is normal and has no other attributes set. This attribute is valid only if used alone.                                                                                                                                               |
| NotContentIndexed | Enumeration constant | The file will not be indexed by the operating system's content indexing service.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Offline           | Enumeration constant | The file is offline. The data of the file is not immediately available.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ReadOnly          | Enumeration constant | The file is read-only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ReparsePoint      | Enumeration constant | The file contains a reparse point, which is a block of user-defined data associated with a file or a directory.                                                                                                                               |
| SparseFile        | Enumeration constant | The file is a sparse file. Sparse files are typically large files whose data are mostly zeros.                                                                                                                                                |
| System            | Enumeration constant | The file is a system file. The file is part of the operating system or is used exclusively by the operating system.                                                                                                                           |
| Temporary         | Enumeration constant | The file is temporary. File systems attempt to keep all of the data in memory for quicker access rather than flushing the data back to mass storage. A temporary file should be deleted by the application as soon as it is no longer needed. |
| ReparsePoint      | Enumeration constant | The file contains a reparse point, which is a block of user-defined data associated with a file or a directory.                                                                                                                               |

In PowerShell, this type is System.IO.FileAttributes with attribute
FlagsAttribute.

`FlagsAttribute`. The following extra values are defined: `Compiled`, `CultureInvariant`,
`ECMAScript`, `ExplicitCapture`, `IgnorePatternWhitespace`, `Multiline`, `RightToLeft`,
`Singleline`.

## 4.3 Reference types

### 4.3.1 Strings

A string value has type string and is an immutable sequence of zero or more characters of type char
each containing a UTF-16-encoded 16-bit Unicode code point.

Type string has the following accessible members:

| **Member** |  **Member Kind**  |    **Type**     |                         **Purpose**                         |
| ---------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

All array types are derived from the type `Array`. This type has the following accessible members:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Member</strong></th>
<th><strong>Member Kind</strong></th>
<th><strong>Type</strong></th>
<th><strong>Purpose</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Length</td>

<td>int/none</td>
<td><p>Number of elements in a given dimension</p>
<p>GetLength(int <em>dimension</em>)</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For more details on arrays, see [§9.][]

In PowerShell, `Array` maps to `System.Array`.

### 4.3.3 Hashtables

Type Hashtable has the following accessible members:

| **Member** |  **Member Kind**  |        **Type**        |                     **Purpose**                     |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Count      | Instance Property | int                    | Gets the number of key/value pairs in the Hashtable |
| Keys       | Instance Property | Implementation-defined | Gets a collection of all the keys                   |
| Values     | Instance Property | Implementation-defined | Gets a collection of all the values                 |
| Remove     | Instance Method   | void/none              | Removes the designated key/value                    |

For more details on Hashtables, see §10.

In PowerShell, `Hashtable` maps to `System.Collections.Hashtable`. `Hashtable` elements are stored
in an object of type `DictionaryEntry`, and the collections returned by Keys and Values have type
`ICollection`.

### 4.3.4 The xml type

Type xml implements the W3C Document Object Model (DOM) Level 1 Core and the Core DOM Level 2. The
DOM is an in-memory (cache) tree representation of an XML document and enables the navigation and
editing of this document. This type supports the subscript operator [] ([§7.1.4.4][]).

In PowerShell, `xml` maps to `System.Xml.XmlDocument`.

### 4.3.5 The regex type

Type `regex` provides machinery for supporting regular expression processing. It is used to
constrain the type of a parameter ([§5.3][]) whose corresponding argument might contain a regular
expression.

In PowerShell, `regex` maps to `System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex`.

### 4.3.6 The ref type

Ordinarily, arguments are passed to commands by value. In the case of an argument having some value
type a copy of the value is passed. In the case of an argument having some reference type a copy of
the reference is passed.

Type ref provides machinery to allow arguments to be passed to commands by reference, so the
commands can modify the argument's value. Type ref has the following accessible members:

| **Member** |        **Member Kind**         |                **Type**                 |              **Purpose**              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Value      | Instance property (read-write) | The type of the value being referenced. | Gets/sets the value being referenced. |

Consider the following function definition and call:

```powershell
function Doubler {
    param ([ref]$x) # parameter received by reference
    $x.Value *= 2.0 # note that 2.0 has type double
}

$number = 8 # designates a value of type int, value 8
Doubler([ref]$number) # argument received by reference
$number # designates a value of type double, value 8.0
```

Consider the case in which $number is type-constrained:

```powershell
[int]$number = 8 # designates a value of type int, value 8
Doubler([ref]$number) # argument received by reference
$number # designates a value of type int, value 8
```

As shown, both the argument and its corresponding parameter must be declared `ref`.

In PowerShell, `ref` maps to `System.Management.Automation.PSReference`.

### 4.3.7 The scriptblock type

Type `scriptblock` represents a precompiled block of script text ([§7.1.8][]) that can be used as a
single unit. It has the following accessible members:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Member</strong></th>
<th><strong>Member Kind</strong></th>
<th><strong>Type</strong></th>
<th><strong>Purpose</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Attributes</td>
<td>Instance property (read-only)</td>
<td>Collection of attributes</td>
<td>Gets the attributes of the script block.</td>

<td>Static method</td>
<td>scriptblock<br />
/string</td>
<td>Creates a new scriptblock object that contains the specified script.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

In PowerShell, `scriptblock` maps to `System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock`. `Invoke` returns a
collection of `PsObject`.

### 4.3.9 The ordered type

Type `ordered` is a pseudo type used only for conversions.

### 4.3.10 The pscustomobject type

Type `pscustomobject` is a pseudo type used only for conversions.

## 4.4 Generic types

A number of programming languages and environments provide types that can be *specialized*. Many of
these types are referred to as *container types*, as instances of them are able to contain objects
of some other type. Consider a type called Stack that can represent a stack of values, which can be
pushed on and popped off. Typically, the user of a stack wants to store only one kind of object on
that stack. However, if the language or environment does not support type specialization, multiple
distinct variants of the type Stack must be implemented even though they all perform the same task,
just with different type elements.

Type specialization allows a *generic type* to be implemented such that it can be constrained to
handling some subset of types when it is used. For example,

- A generic stack type that is specialized to hold strings might be written as `Stack[string]`.
- A generic dictionary type that is specialized to hold int keys with associated string values might
  be written as `Dictionary[int,string]`.
- A stack of stack of strings might be written as `Stack[Stack[string]]`.

Although PowerShell does not define any built-in generic types, it can use such types if they are
provided by the host environment. See the syntax in [§7.1.10][].

The complete name for the type `Stack[string]` suggested above is
`System.Collections.Generic.Stack[string]`. The complete name for the type `Dictionary[int,string]`
suggested above is `System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary[int,string]`.

## 4.5 Anonymous types

In some circumstances, an implementation of PowerShell creates objects of some type, and those
objects have members accessible to script. However, the actual name of those types need not be
specified, so long as the accessible members are specified sufficiently for them to be used. That
is, scripts can save objects of those types and access their members without actually knowing those
types' names. The following subsections specify these types.

### 4.5.1 Provider description type

## 4.6 Type extension and adaptation

A PowerShell implementation includes a family of core types (which are documented in this chapter)
that each contain their own set of *base members*. Those members can be methods or properties, and
they can be instance or static members. For example, the base members of the type string
([§4.3.1][]) are the instance property Length and the instance methods ToLower and ToUpper.

When an object is created, it contains all the instance properties of that object's type, and the
instance methods of that type can be called on that object. An object may be customized via the
addition of instance members at runtime. The result is called a *custom object*. Any members added
to an instance exist only for the life of that instance; other instances of the same core type are
unaffected.

The base member set of a type can be augmented by the addition of the following kinds of members:

- *adapted members*, via the *Extended Type System* (ETS), most details of which are unspecified.
- *extended members*, via the cmdlet [Add-Member](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.Add-Member).

In PowerShell, extended members can also be added via `types.ps1xml` files. Adapted and extended
members are collectively called *synthetic* *members*.

The ETS adds the following members to all PowerShell objects: **psbase**, **psadapted**,
**psextended**, and **pstypenames**. See the **Force** and **View** parameters in the cmdlet
[Get-Member](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.Get-Member) for more information on these members.

An instance member may hide an extended and/or adapted member of the same name, and an extended
member may hide an adapted member. In such cases, the member sets **psadapted** and **psextended**
can be used to access those hidden members.

If a `types.ps1xml` specifies a member called **Supports**, `obj.psextended` provides access to just
that member and not to a member added via `Add-Member`.

There are three ways create a custom object having a new member M:

1. This approach can be used to add one or more NoteProperty members.

   ```powershell
   $x = New-Object PsObject -Property @{M = 123}`
   ```

1. This approach can be used to add NoteProperty or ScriptMethod members.

   ```powershell
   $x = New-Module -AsCustomObject {$M = 123 ; Export-ModuleMember --Variable M}`
   ```

1. This approach can be used to add any kind of member.

   ```powershell
   $x = New-Object PsObject
   Add-Member -InputObject $x -Name M -MemberType NoteProperty -Value 123
   ```

`PsObject` is the base type of all PowerShell types.
