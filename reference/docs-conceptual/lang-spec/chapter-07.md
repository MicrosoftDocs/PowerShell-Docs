# 7. Expressions

Syntax:

```Syntax
expression:
    primary-expression
    bitwise-expression
    logical-expression
    comparison-expression
    additive-expression
    multiplicative-expression

dash: one of
    - (U+002D)
    EnDash character (U+2013)
    EmDash character (U+2014)
    Horizontal bar character (U+2015)

dashdash:
    dash dash
```

Description:

An _expression_ is a sequence of operators and operands that designates a method, a function, a
writable location, or a value; specifies the computation of a value; produces one or more side
effects; or performs some combination thereof. For example,

- The literal 123 is an expression that designates the int value 123.
- The expression `1,2,3,4` designates the 4-element array object having the values shown.
- The expression `10.4 * $a` specifies a computation.
- The expression `$a++` produces a side effect.
- The expression `$a[$i--] = $b[++$j]` performs a combination of these things.

Except as specified for some operators, the order of evaluation of terms in an expression and the
order in which side effects take place are both unspecified. Examples of unspecified behavior
include the following: `$i++ + $i`, `$i + --$i`, and `$w[$j++] = $v[$j]`.

An implementation of PowerShell may provide support for user-defined types, and those types may have
operations defined on them. All details of such types and operations are implementation defined.

A _top-level expression_ is one that is not part of some larger expression. If a top-level
expression contains a side-effect operator the value of that expression is not written to the
pipeline; otherwise, it is. See [§7.1.1][§7.1.1] for a detailed discussion of this.

Ordinarily, an expression that designates a collection ([§4[§4]]) is enumerated into its constituent
elements when the value of that expression is used. However, this is not the case when the
expression is a cmdlet invocation. For example,

```powershell
$x = 10,20,30
$a = $($x; 99)                     # $a.Length is 4

$x = New-Object 'int[]' 3
$a = $($x; 99)                     # equivalent, $a.Length is 4

$a = $(New-Object 'int[]' 3; 99)   # $a.Length is 2
```

In the first two uses of the `$(...)` operator, the expression designating the collection is the
variable `$x`, which is enumerated resulting in three `int` values, plus the `int` 99. However, in
the third case, the expression is a direct call to a cmdlet, so the result is not enumerated, and
`$a` is an array of two elements, `int[3]` and `int`.

If an operation is not defined by PowerShell, the type of the value designated by the left operand
is inspected to see if it has a corresponding `op_<operation>` method.

## 7.1 Primary expressions

Syntax:

```Syntax
primary-expression:
    value
    member-access
    element-access
    invocation-expression
    post-increment-expression
    post-decrement-expression

value:
    parenthesized-expression
    sub-expression
    array-expression
    script-block-expression
    hash-literal-expression
    literal
    type-literal
    variable
```

### 7.1.1 Grouping parentheses

Syntax:

> [!TIP]
> The `~opt~` notation in the syntax definitions indicates that the lexical entity is optional in
> the syntax.

```Syntax
parenthesized-expression:
    ( new-lines~opt~ pipeline new-lines~opt~ )
```

Description:

A parenthesized expression is a _primary-expression_ whose type and value are the same as those of
the expression without the parentheses. If the expression designates a variable then the
parenthesized expression designates that same variable. For example, `$x.m` and `($x).m` are
equivalent.

Grouping parentheses may be used in an expression to document the default precedence and
associativity within that expression. They can also be used to override that default precedence and
associativity. For example,

```powershell
4 + 6 * 2    # 16
4 + (6 * 2)  # 16 document default precedence
(4 + 6) * 2  # 20 override default precedence
```

Ordinarily, grouping parentheses at the top-most level are redundant. However, that is not always
the case. Consider the following example:

```powershell
2,4,6       # Length 3; values 2,4,6
(2,4),6     # Length 2; values [object[]],int
```

In the second case, the parentheses change the semantics, resulting in an array whose two elements
are an array of 2 ints and the scalar int 6.

Here's another exception:

```powershell
23.5/2.4          # pipeline gets 9.79166666666667
$a = 1234 * 3.5   # value not written to pipeline
$a                # pipeline gets 4319
```

In the first and third cases, the value of the result is written to the pipeline. However, although
the expression in the second case is evaluated, the result is not written to the pipeline due to the
presence of the side-effect operator `=` at the top level. (Removal of the `$a = ` part allows the
value to be written, as `*` is not a side-effect operator.)

To stop a value of any expression not containing top-level side effects from being written to the
pipeline, discard it explicitly, as follows:

```powershell
# None of these value are written to pipeline
[void](23.5/2.4)
[void]$a
$null = $a
$a > $null
```

To write to the pipeline the value of any expression containing top-level side effects, enclose that
expression in parentheses, as follows:

```powershell
($a = 1234 * 3.5) # pipeline gets 4319
```

As such, the grouping parentheses in this case are not redundant.

In the following example, we have variable substitution ([§2.3.5.2][§2.3.5.2]) taking place in a
string literal:

```powershell
">$($a = -23)<"    # value not written to pipeline, get ><
">$(($a = -23))<"  # pipeline gets >-23<
```

In the first case, the parentheses represent a _sub-expression_'s delimiters _not_ grouping
parentheses, and as the top-level expression contains a side-effect operator, the expression's value
is not written to the pipeline. Of course, the `>` and `<` characters are still written.) If
grouping parenthesis are added -- as shown in the second case -- writing is enabled.

The following examples each contain top-level side-effect operators:

```powershell
$a = $b = 0      # value not written to pipeline
$a = ($b = 0)    # value not written to pipeline
($a = ($b = 0))  # pipeline gets 0

++$a             # value not written to pipeline
(++$b)           # pipeline gets 1

$a--             # value not written to pipeline
($b--)           # pipeline gets 1
```

The use of grouping parentheses around an expression containing no top-level side effects makes
those parentheses redundant. For example;

```powershell
$a      # pipeline gets 0
($a)    # no side effect, so () redundant
```

Consider the following example that has two side effects, neither of which is at the top level:

```powershell
12.6 + ($a = 10 - ++$b) # pipeline gets 21.6.
```

The result is written to the pipeline, as the top-level expression has no side effects.

### 7.1.2 Member access

Syntax:

```Syntax
member-access:
    primary-expression . new-line~opt~ member-name
    primary-expression :: new-line~opt~ member-name
```

Note that no whitespace is allowed after _primary-expression_.

Description:

The operator `.` is used to select an instance member from an object, or a key from a `Hashtable`.
The left operand must designate an object, and the right operand must designate an accessible
instance member.

Either the right operand designates an accessible instance member within the type of the object
designated by the left operand or, if the left operand designates an array, the right operand
designates accessible instance members within each element of the array.

Whitespace is not permitted before the `.` operator.

This operator is left associative.

The operator `::` is used to select a static member from a given type. The left operand must
designate a type, and the right-hand operand must designate an accessible static member within that
type.

Whitespace is not permitted before the `::` operator.

This operator is left associative.

If the right-hand operand designates a writable location within the type of the object designated by
the left operand, then the whole expression designates a writable location.

Examples:

```powershell
$a = 10, 20, 30
$a.Length                    # get instance property

(10, 20, 30).Length

$property = "Length"
$a.$property                 # property name is a variable

$h1 = @{ FirstName = "James"; LastName = "Anderson"; IDNum = 123
}
$h1.FirstName                # designates the key FirstName
$h1.Keys                     # gets the collection of keys

[int]::MinValue              # get static property
[double]::PositiveInfinity   # get static property
$property = "MinValue"
[long]::$property            # property name is a variable

foreach ($t in [byte], [int], [long]) {
    $t::MaxValue             # get static property
}

$a = @{ID = 1 }, @{ID = 2 }, @{ID = 3 }
$a.ID                        # get ID from each element in the array
```

### 7.1.3 Invocation expressions

Syntax:

```Syntax
invocation-expression:
    primary-expression . new-line~opt~ member-name argument-list
    primary-expression :: new-line~opt~ member-name argument-list

argument-list:
    ( argument-expression-list~opt~ new-lines~opt~ )
```

Note that no whitespace is allowed after _primary-expression_.

Description:

An _invocation-expression_ calls the method designated by `primary-expression.member-name` or
`primary-expression::member-name`. The parentheses in _argument-list_ contain a possibly empty,
comma-separated list of expressions that designate the _arguments_ whose values are passed to the
method. Before the method is called, the arguments are evaluated and converted according to the
rules of [§6][§6], if necessary, to match the types expected by the method. The order of evaluation
of `primary-expression.member-name`, `primary-expression::member-name`, and the arguments is
unspecified.

This operator is left associative.

The type of the result of an _invocation-expression_ is a _method-designator_ ([§4.5.24][§4.5.24]).

Examples:

```powershell
[math]::Sqrt(2.0)            # call method with argument 2.0
[char]::IsUpper("a")         # call method
$b = "abc#$%XYZabc"
$b.ToUpper()                 # call instance method

[math]::Sqrt(2)              # convert 2 to 2.0 and call method
[math]::Sqrt(2D)             # convert 2D to 2.0 and call method
[math]::Sqrt($true)          # convert $true to 1.0 and call method
[math]::Sqrt("20")           # convert "20" to 20 and call method

$a = [math]::Sqrt            # get method descriptor for Sqrt
$a.Invoke(2.0)               # call Sqrt via the descriptor
$a = [math]::("Sq"+"rt")     # get method descriptor for Sqrt
$a.Invoke(2.0)               # call Sqrt via the descriptor
$a = [char]::ToLower         # get method descriptor for ToLower
$a.Invoke("X")               # call ToLower via the descriptor
```

### 7.1.4 Element access

Syntax:

```Syntax
element-access:
    primary-expression [ new-lines~opt~ expression new-lines~opt~ ]
```

Description:

There must not be any whitespace between _primary-expression_ and the left square bracket (`[`).

#### 7.1.4.1 Subscripting an array

Description:

Arrays are discussed in detail in [§9.][§9.] If _expression_ is a 1-dimensional array, see
[§7.1.4.5][§7.1.4.5].

When _primary-expression_ designates a 1-dimensional array _A_, the operator `[]` returns the
element located at `A[0 + expression]` after the value of _expression_ has been converted to `int`.
The result has the element type of the array being subscripted. If _expression_ is negative,
`A[expression]` designates the element located at `A[A.Length + expression]`.

When _primary-expression_ designates a 2-dimensional array _B_, the operator `[]` returns the
element located at `B[0 + row,0 + column]` after the value of the _row_ and _column_ components of
_expression_ (which are specified as a comma-separated list) have been converted to `int`. The
result has the element type of the array being subscripted. Unlike for a 1-dimensional array,
negative positions have no special meaning.

When _primary-expression_ designates an array of three or more dimensions, the rules for
2-dimensional arrays apply and the dimension positions are specified as a comma-separated list of
values.

If a read access on a non-existing element is attempted, the result is `$null`. It is an error to
write to a non-existing element.

For a multidimensional-array subscript expression, the order of evaluation of the dimension position
expressions is unspecified. For example, given a 3-dimensional array `$a`, the behavior of
`$a[$i++,$i,++$i]` is unspecified.

If _expression_ is an array, see [§7.1.4.5][§7.1.4.5].

This operator is left associative.

Examples:

```powershell
$a = [int[]](10,20,30) # [int[]], Length 3
$a[1] # returns int 20
$a[20] # no such position, returns $null
$a[-1] # returns int 30, i.e., $a[$a.Length-1]
$a[2] = 5 # changes int 30 to int 5
$a[20] = 5 # implementation-defined behavior

$a = New-Object 'double[,]' 3,2
$a[0,0] = 10.5 # changes 0.0 to 10.5
$a[0,0]++ # changes 10.5 to 10.6

$list = ("red",$true,10),20,(1.2, "yes")
$list[2][1] # returns string "yes"

$a = @{ A = 10 },@{ B = $true },@{ C = 123.45 }
$a[1]["B"] # $a[1] is a Hashtable, where B is a key

$a = "red","green"
$a[1][4] # returns string "n" from string in $a[1]
```

If a write access to a non-existing element is attempted, an **IndexOutOfRange** exception is
raised.

#### 7.1.4.2 Subscripting a string

Description:

When _primary-expression_ designates a string _S_, the operator `[]` returns the character located
in the zero-based position indicated by _expression_, as a char. If _expression_ is greater than or
equal to that string's length, the result is `$null`. If _expression_ is negative,
`S[expression]` designates the element located at `S[S.Length + expression]`.

Examples:

```powershell
$s = "Hello"   # string, Length 5, positions 0-4
$c = $s[1]     # returns "e" as a string
$c = $s[20]    # no such position, returns $null
$c = $s[-1]    # returns "o", i.e., $s[$s.Length-1]
```

#### 7.1.4.3 Subscripting a Hashtable

Description:

When _primary-expression_ designates a Hashtable, the operator `[]` returns the value(s) associated
with the key(s) designated by _expression_. The type of _expression_ is not restricted.

When _expression_ is a single key name, the result is the associated value and has that type, unless
no such key exists, in which case, the result is `$null`. If `$null` is used as the key the behavior
is implementation defined. If _expression_ is an array of key names, see [§7.1.4.5][§7.1.4.5].

If _expression_ is an array, see [§7.1.4.5][§7.1.4.5].

Examples:

```powershell
$h1 = @{ FirstName = "James"; LastName = "Anderson"; IDNum = 123 }
$h1['FirstName']     # the value associated with key FirstName
$h1['BirthDate']     # no such key, returns $null

$h1 = @{ 10 = "James"; 20.5 = "Anderson"; $true = 123 }
$h1[10]              # returns value "James" using key 10
$h1[20.5]            # returns value "Anderson" using key 20.5
$h1[$true]           # returns value 123 using key $true
```

When _expression_ is a single key name, if `$null` is used as the only value to subscript a
Hashtable, a **NullArrayIndex** exception is raised.

#### 7.1.4.4 Subscripting an XML document

Description:

When _primary-expression_ designates an object of type xml, _expression_ is converted to string, if
necessary, and the operator `[]` returns the first child element having the name specified by
_expression_. The type of _expression_ must be string. The type of the result is implementation
defined. The result can be subscripted to return its first child element. If no child element exists
with the name specified by _expression_, the result is `$null`. The result does not designate a
writable location.

Examples:

```powershell
$x = [xml]@"
<Name>
<FirstName>Mary</FirstName>
<LastName>King</LastName>
</Name>
"@

$x['Name']                # refers to the element Name
$x['Name']['FirstName']   # refers to the element FirstName within Name
$x['FirstName']           # No such child element at the top level, result is $null
```

The type of the result is `System.Xml.XmlElement` or `System.String`.

#### 7.1.4.5 Generating array slices

When _primary-expression_ designates an object of a type that is enumerable (§4) or a Hashtable, and
_expression_ is a 1-dimensional array, the result is an array slice ([§9.9][§9.9]) containing the
elements of _primary-expression_ designated by the elements of _expression_.

In the case of a Hashtable, the array slice contains the associated values to the keys provided,
unless no such key exists, in which case, the corresponding element is `$null`. If `$null` is used
as any key name the behavior is implementation defined.

Examples:

```powershell
$a = [int[]](30,40,50,60,70,80,90)
$a[1,3,5]                 # slice has Length 3, value 40,60,80
$a[,5]                    # slice with Length 1
$a[@()]                   # slice with Length 0
$a[-1..-3]                # slice with Length 3, value 90,80,70
$a = New-Object 'int[,]' 3,2
$a[0,0] = 10; $a[0,1] = 20; $a[1,0] = 30
$a[1,1] = 40; $a[2,0] = 50; $a[2,1] = 60
$a[(0,1),(1,0)]           # slice with Length 2, value 20,30, parens needed
$h1 = @{ FirstName = "James"; LastName = "Anderson"; IDNum = 123 }
$h1['FirstName']          # the value associated with key FirstName
$h1['BirthDate']          # no such key, returns $null
$h1['FirstName','IDNum']  # returns [object[]], Length 2 (James/123)
$h1['FirstName','xxx']    # returns [object[]], Length 2 (James/$null)
$h1[$null,'IDNum']        # returns [object[]], Length 2 ($null/123)
```

Windows PowerShell: When _expression_ is a collection of two or more key names, if `$null` is used
as any key name that key is ignored and has no corresponding element in the resulting array.

### 7.1.5 Postfix increment and decrement operators

Syntax:

```Syntax
post-increment-expression:
    primary-expression ++

post-decrement-expression:
    primary-expression dashdash
```

Description:

The _primary-expression_ must designate a writable location having a value of numeric type (§4) or
the value `$null`. If the value designated by the operand is `$null`, that value is converted to
type int and value zero before the operator is evaluated. The type of the value designated by
_primary-expression_ may change when the result is stored. See [§7.11][§7.11] for a discussion of
type change via assignment.

The result produced by the postfix `++` operator is the value designated by the operand. After that
result is obtained, the value designated by the operand is incremented by 1 of the appropriate type.
The type of the result of expression `E++` is the same as for the result of the expression `E + 1`
([§7.7][§7.7]).

The result produced by the postfix `--` operator is the value designated by the operand. After that
result is obtained, the value designated by the operand is decremented by 1 of the appropriate type.
The type of the result of expression `E--` is the same as for the result of the expression `E - 1`
([§7.7][§7.7]).

These operators are left associative.

Examples:

```powershell
$i = 0                # $i = 0
$i++                  # $i is incremented by 1
$j = $i--             # $j takes on the value of $i before the decrement

$a = 1,2,3
$b = 9,8,7
$i = 0
$j = 1
$b[$j--] = $a[$i++]   # $b[1] takes on the value of $a[0], then $j is
                      # decremented, $i incremented

$i = 2147483647       # $i holds a value of type int
$i++                  # $i now holds a value of type double because
                      # 2147483648 is too big to fit in type int

[int]$k = 0           # $k is constrained to int
$k = [int]::MaxValue  # $k is set to 2147483647
$k++                  # 2147483648 is too big to fit, imp-def behavior

$x = $null            # target is unconstrained, $null goes to [int]0
$x++                  # value treated as int, 0->1
```

### 7.1.6 $(...) operator

Syntax:

```Syntax
sub-expression:
    $( new-lines~opt~ statement-list~opt~ new-lines~opt~ )
```

Description:

If _statement-list_ is omitted, the result is `$null`. Otherwise, _statement-list_ is evaluated. Any
objects written to the pipeline as part of the evaluation are collected in an unconstrained
1-dimensional array, in order. If the array of collected objects is empty, the result is `$null`. If
the array of collected objects contains a single element, the result is that element; otherwise, the
result is the unconstrained 1-dimensional array of collected results.

Examples:

```powershell
$j = 20
$($i = 10) # pipeline gets nothing
$(($i = 10)) # pipeline gets int 10
$($i = 10; $j) # pipeline gets int 20
$(($i = 10); $j) # pipeline gets [object[]](10,20)
$(($i = 10); ++$j) # pipeline gets int 10
$(($i = 10); (++$j)) # pipeline gets [object[]](10,22)
$($i = 10; ++$j) # pipeline gets nothing
$(2,4,6) # pipeline gets [object[]](2,4,6)
```

### 7.1.7 @(...) operator

Syntax:

```Syntax
array-expression:
    @( new-lines~opt~ statement-list~opt~ new-lines~opt~ )
```

Description:

If _statement-list_ is omitted, the result is an unconstrained 1-dimensional array of length zero.
Otherwise, _statement-list_ is evaluated, and any objects written to the pipeline as part of the
evaluation are collected in an unconstrained 1-dimensional array, in order. The result is the
(possibly empty) unconstrained 1-dimensional array.

Examples:

```powershell
$j = 20
@($i = 10)             # 10 not written to pipeline, result is array of 0
@(($i = 10))           # pipeline gets 10, result is array of 1
@($i = 10; $j)         # 10 not written to pipeline, result is array of 1
@(($i = 10); $j)       # pipeline gets 10, result is array of 2
@(($i = 10); ++$j)     # pipeline gets 10, result is array of 1
@(($i = 10); (++$j))   # pipeline gets both values, result is array of 2
@($i = 10; ++$j)       # pipeline gets nothing, result is array of 0

$a = @(2,4,6)          # result is array of 3
@($a)                  # result is the same array of 3
@(@($a))               # result is the same array of 3
```

### 7.1.8 Script block expression

Syntax:

```Syntax
script-block-expression:
    { new-lines~opt~ script-block new-lines~opt~ }

script-block:
    param-block~opt~ statement-terminators~opt~ script-block-body~opt~

script-block-body:
    named-block-list
    statement-list
```

Description:

_param-block_ is described in [§8.10.9][§8.10.9]. _named-block-list_ is described in
[§8.10.7][§8.10.7].

A script block is an unnamed block of statements that can be used as a single unit. Script blocks
can be used to invoke a block of code as if it was a single command, or they can be assigned to
variables that can be executed.

The _named-block-list_ or _statement-list_ is executed and the type and value(s) of the result are
the type and value(s) of the results of those statement sets.

A _script-block-expression_ has type scriptblock ([§4.3.7][§4.3.7]).

If _param-block_ is omitted, any arguments passed to the script block are available via `$args`
([§8.10.1][§8.10.1]).

During parameter binding, a script block can be passed either as a script block object or as the
result after the script block has been evaluated. See [§6.17][§6.17] for further information.

### 7.1.9 Hash literal expression

Syntax:

```Syntax
hash-literal-expression:
    @{ new-lines~opt~ hash-literal-body~opt~ new-lines~opt~ }

hash-literal-body:
    hash-entry
    hash-literal-body statement-terminators hash-entry

hash-entry:
    key-expression = new-lines~opt~ statement

key-expression:
    simple-name
    unary-expression

statement-terminators:
    statement-terminator
    statement-terminators statement-terminator

statement-terminator:
    ;
    new-line-character
```

Description:

A _hash-literal-expression_ is used to create a Hashtable (§10) of zero or more elements each of
which is a key/value pair.

The key may have any type except the null type. The associated values may have any type, including
the null type, and each of those values may be any expression that designates the desired value,
including `$null`.

The ordering of the key/value pairs is not significant.

Examples:

```powershell
$h1 = @{ FirstName = "James"; LastName = "Anderson"; IDNum = 123 }
$last = "Anderson"; $IDNum = 120
$h2 = @{ FirstName = "James"; LastName = $last; IDNum = $IDNum + 3 }
$h3 = @{ }
$h4 = @{ 10 = "James"; 20.5 = "Anderson"; $true = 123 }
```

which creates two Hashtables, `$h1` and `$h2`, each containing three key/value pairs, and a third,
`$h3`, that is empty. Hashtable `$h4` has keys of various types.

### 7.1.10 Type literal expression

Syntax:

```Syntax
type-literal:
    [ type-spec ]

type-spec:
    array-type-name new-lines~opt~ dimension~opt~ ]
    generic-type-name new-lines~opt~ generic-type-arguments ]
    type-name

dimension:
    ,
    dimension ,

generic-type-arguments:
    type-spec new-lines~opt~
    generic-type-arguments , new-lines~opt~ type-spec

array-type-name:
    type-name [

generic-type-name:
    type-name [
```

Description:

A _type-literal_ is represented in an implementation by some unspecified _underlying type_. As a
result, a type name is a synonym for its underlying type.

Type literals are used in a number of contexts:

- Specifying an explicit conversion (§6, [§7.2.9][§7.2.9])
- Creating a type-constrained array ([§9.4][§9.4])
- Accessing the static members of an object ([§7.1.2][§7.1.2])
- Specifying a type constraint on a variable ([§5.3][§5.3]) or a function parameter
  ([§8.10.2][§8.10.2])

Examples:

```powershell
[int].IsPrimitive        # $true
[Object[]].FullName      # "System.Object[]"
[int[,,]].GetArrayRank() # 3
```

A generic stack type ([§4.4][§4.4]) that is specialized to hold strings might be written as
`[Stack[string]]`, and a generic dictionary type that is specialized to hold `int` keys with
associated string values might be written as `[Dictionary[int,string]]`.

The type of a _type-literal_ is `System.Type`. The complete name for the type `Stack[string]`
suggested above is `System.Collections.Generic.Stack[int]`. The complete name for the type
`Dictionary[int,string]` suggested above is `System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary[int,string]`.

## 7.2 Unary operators

### 7.2.1 Unary comma operator

Description:

The comma operator (`,`) creates an unconstrained 1-dimensional array having one element, whose type
and value are that of _unary-expression_.

This operator is right associative.

Examples:

```powershell
$a = ,10         # create an unconstrained array of 1 element, $a[0],
                 # which has type int

$a = ,(10,"red") # create an unconstrained array of 1 element,
$a[0],
                 # which is an unconstrained array of 2 elements,
                 # $a[0][0] an int, and $a[0][1] a string

$a = ,,10        # create an unconstrained array of 1 element, which is
                 # an unconstrained array of 1 element, which is an int
                 # $a[0][0] is the int. Contrast this with @(@(10))
```

### 7.2.2 Logical NOT

Syntax:

```Syntax
logical-not-operator:
    dash not

dash: one of
    - (U+002D)
    EnDash character (U+2013)
    EmDash character (U+2014)
    Horizontal bar character (U+2015)
```

Description:

The operator `-not` converts the value designated by _unary-expression_ to type bool
([§6.2][§6.2]), if necessary, and produces a result of that type. If _unary-expression_'s value is
True, the result is False, and vice versa. The operator `!` is an alternate spelling for `-not`.

This operator is right associative.

Examples:

```powershell
-not $true         # False
-not -not $false   # False
-not 0             # True
-not 1.23          # False
!"xyz"             # False
```

### 7.2.3 Bitwise NOT

Syntax:

```Syntax
bitwise-not-operator:
    dash bnot

dash: one of
    - (U+002D)
    EnDash character (U+2013)
    EmDash character (U+2014)
    Horizontal bar character (U+2015)
```

Description:

The operator `-bnot` converts the value designated by _unary-expression_ to an integer type
([§6.4][§6.4]), if necessary. If the converted value can be represented in type **int** then that is
the result type. Else, if the converted value can be represented in type **long** then that is the
result type. Otherwise, the expression is ill-formed. The resulting value is the ones-complement of
the converted value.

This operator is right associative.

Examples:

```powershell
-bnot $true         # int with value 0xFFFFFFFE
-bnot 10            # int with value 0xFFFFFFF5
-bnot 2147483648.1  # long with value 0xFFFFFFFF7FFFFFFF
-bnot $null         # int with value 0xFFFFFFFF
-bnot "0xabc"       # int with value 0xFFFFF543
```

### 7.2.4 Unary plus

Description:

An expression of the form `+ unary-expression` is treated as if it were written as
`0 + unary-expression` ([§7.7][§7.7]). The integer literal `0` has type `int`.

This operator is right associative.

Examples:

```powershell
+123L         # type long, value 123
+0.12340D     # type decimal, value 0.12340
+"0xabc"      # type int, value 2748
```

### 7.2.5 Unary minus

Description:

An expression of the form `- unary-expression` is treated as if it were written as
`0 - unary-expression` ([§7.7][§7.7]). The integer literal 0 has type `int`. The minus operator can
be any one of the _dash_ characters listed in [§7.2][§7.2].

This operator is right associative.

Examples:

```powershell
-$true     # type int, value -1
-123L      # type long, value -123
-0.12340D  # type decimal, value -0.12340
```

### 7.2.6 Prefix increment and decrement operators

Description:

The _unary-expression_ must designate a writable location having a value of numeric type ([§4][§4])
or the value `$null`. If the value designated by its _unary-expression_ is `$null`,
_unary-expression_'s value is converted to type int and value zero before the operator is evaluated.

> [!NOTE]
> The type of the value designated by _unary-expression_ may change when the result is stored. See
> [§7.11][§7.11] for a discussion of type change via assignment.

For the prefix increment operator `++` , the value of _unary-expression_ is incremented by `1` of
the appropriate type. The result is the new value after incrementing has taken place. The expression
`++E` is equivalent to `E += 1` ([§7.11.2][§7.11.2]).

For the prefix decrement operator `--` , the value of _unary-expression_ is decremented by `1` of
the appropriate type. The result is the new value after decrementing has taken place. The expression
`--E` is equivalent to `E -= 1` ([§7.11.2][§7.11.2]). The prefix decrement operator can be any of
the patterns matching the _dashdash_ pattern in [§7.2][§7.2].

These operators are right associative.

Examples:

```powershell
$i = 0                # $i = 0
++$i                  # $i is incremented by 1
$j = --$i             # $i is decremented then $j takes on the value of $i

$a = 1,2,3
$b = 9,8,7
$i = 0;
$j = 1
$b[--$j] = $a[++$i]   # $j is # decremented, $i incremented, then $b[0]
                      # takes on the value of $a[1]

$i = 2147483647       # $i holds a value of type int
++$i                  # $i now holds a value of type double because
                      # 2147483648 is too big to fit in type int

[int]$k = 0           # $k is constrained to int
$k = [int]::MinValue  # $k is set to -2147483648
--$k                  # -2147483649 is too small to fit, imp-def behavior

$x = $null            # target is unconstrained, $null goes to [int]0
--$x                  # value treated as int, 0 becomes -1
```

### 7.2.7 The unary -join operator

Syntax:

```Syntax
join-operator:
    dash join

dash: one of
    - (U+002D)
    EnDash character (U+2013)
    EmDash character (U+2014)
    Horizontal bar character (U+2015)
```

Description:

The unary `-join` operator produces a string that is the concatenation of the value of one or more
objects designated by _unary-expression_. (A separator can be inserted by using the binary version
of this operator ([§7.8.4.4][§7.8.4.4]).)

_unary-expression_ can be a scalar value or a collection.

Examples:

```powershell
-join (10, 20, 30)             # result is "102030"
-join (123, $false, 19.34e17)  # result is "123False1.934E+18"
-join 12345                    # result is "12345"
-join $null                    # result is ""
```

### 7.2.8 The unary -split operator

Syntax:

```Syntax
split-operator:
    dash split

dash: one of
    - (U+002D)
    EnDash character (U+2013)
    EmDash character (U+2014)
    Horizontal bar character (U+2015)
```

Description:

The unary `-split` operator splits one or more strings designated by _unary-expression_, returning
their subparts in a constrained 1-dimensional array of string. It treats any contiguous group of
whitespace characters as the delimiter between successive subparts. An explicit delimiter string can
be specified by using the binary version of this operator ([§7.8.4.5][§7.8.4.5]) or its two variants
([§7.8][§7.8]).

The delimiter text is not included in the resulting strings. Leading and trailing whitespace in the
input string is ignored. An input string that is empty or contains whitespace only results in an
array of one string, which is empty.

_unary-expression_ can designate a scalar value or an array of strings.

Examples:

```powershell
-split " red`tblue`ngreen " # 3 strings: "red", "blue", "green"
-split ("yes no", "up down") # 4 strings: "yes", "no", "up", "down"
-split " " # 1 (empty) string
```

### 7.2.9 Cast operator

Description:

This operator converts explicitly ([§6][§6]) the value designated by _unary-expression_ to the type
designated by _type-literal_ ([§7.1.10][§7.1.10]). If _type-literal_ is other than void, the type of
the result is the named type, and the value is the value after conversion. If _type-literal_ is
void, no object is written to the pipeline and there is no result.

When an expression of any type is cast to that same type, the resulting type and value is the
_unary-expression_'s type and value.

This operator is right associative.

Examples:

```powershell
[bool]-10        # a bool with value True
[int]-10.70D     # a decimal with value -10
[int]10.7        # an int with value 11
[long]"+2.3e+3"  # a long with value 2300
[char[]]"Hello"  # an array of 5 char with values H, e, l, l, and o.
```

## 7.3 Binary comma operator

Syntax:

```Syntax
array-literal-expression:
    unary-expression , new-lines~opt~ array-literal-expression
```

Description:

The binary comma operator creates a 1-dimensional array whose elements are the values designated by
its operands, in lexical order. The array has unconstrained type.

Examples:

```powershell
2,4,6                    # Length 3; values 2,4,6
(2,4),6                  # Length 2; values [object[]],int
(2,4,6),12,(2..4)        # Length 3; [object[]],int,[object[]]
2,4,6,"red",$null,$true  # Length 6
```

The addition of grouping parentheses to certain binary comma expressions does not document the
default precedence; instead, it changes the result.

## 7.4 Range operator

Syntax:

```Syntax
range-expression:
    unary-expression .. new-lines~opt~ unary-expression
```

Description:

A _range-expression_ creates an unconstrained 1-dimensional array whose elements are the values of
the **int** sequence specified by the range bounds. The values designated by the operands are
converted to **int**, if necessary ([§6.4][§6.4]). The operand designating the lower value after
conversion is the _lower bound_, while the operand designating the higher value after conversion is
the _upper bound_. Both bounds may be the same, in which case, the resulting array has length `1`.
If the left operand designates the lower bound, the sequence is in ascending order. If the left
operand designates the upper bound, the sequence is in descending order.

Conceptually, this operator is a shortcut for the corresponding binary comma operator sequence. For
example, the range `5..8` can also be generated using `5,6,7,8`. However, if an ascending or
descending sequence is needed without having an array, an implementation may avoid generating an
actual array. For example, in `foreach ($i in 1..5) { ... }`, no array need be created.

A _range-expression_ can be used to specify an array slice ([§9.9][§9.9]).

Examples:

```powershell
1..10        # ascending range 1..10
-495..-500   # descending range -495..-500
16..16       # sequence of 1

$x = 1.5
$x..5.40D    # ascending range 2..5

$true..3     # ascending range 1..3
-2..$null    # ascending range -2..0
0xf..0xa     # descending range 15..10
```

## 7.5 Format operator

Syntax:

```Syntax
format-expression:
    format-specification-string format-operator new-lines~opt~ range-expression

format-operator:
    dash f

dash:
    - (U+002D)
    EnDash character (U+2013)
    EmDash character (U+2014)
    Horizontal bar character (U+2015)
```

Description:

A _format-expression_ formats one or more values designated by _range-expression_ according to a
_format-specification-string_ designated by _format-expression_. The positions of the values
designated by _range-expression_ are numbered starting at zero and increasing in lexical order. The
result has type `string`.

A format specification string may contain zero or more format specifications each having the
following form:

`{N [ ,M ][ : FormatString ]}`

_N_ represents a (required) _range-expression_ value position, _M_ represents the (optional) minimum
display width, and _FormatString_ indicates the (optional) format. If the width of a formatted value
exceeds the specified width, the width is increased accordingly. Values whose positions are not
referenced in _FormatString_ are ignored after being evaluated for any side effects. If _N_ refers
to a non-existent position, the behavior is implementation defined. Value of type `$null` and void
are formatted as empty strings. Arrays are formatted as for _sub-expression_ ([§7.1.6][§7.1.6]). To
include the characters `{` and `}` in a format specification without their being interpreted as
format delimiters, write them as `{{` and `}}`, respectively.

For a complete definition of format specifications, see the type `System.IFormattable` in
[Ecma Technical Report TR/84][TR84].

Examples:

```powershell
"__{0,3}__" -f 5                         # __ 5__
"__{0,-3}__" -f 5                        # __5 __
"__{0,3:000}__" -f 5                     # __005__
"__{0,5:0.00}__" -f 5.0                  # __ 5.00__
"__{0:C}__" -f 1234567.888               # __$1,234,567.89__
"__{0:C}__" -f -1234.56                  # __($1,234.56)__
"__{0,12:e2}__" -f 123.456e2             # __ 1.23e+004__
"__{0,-12:p}__" -f -0.252                # __-25.20 % __

$i = 5; $j = 3
"__{0} + {1} <= {2}__" -f $i,$j,($i+$j)  # __5 + 3 <= 8__

$format = "__0x{0:X8}__"
$format -f 65535                         # __0x0000FFFF__
```

In a format specification, if _N_ refers to a non-existent position, a **FormatError** is raised.

## 7.6 Multiplicative operators

Syntax:

```Syntax
multiplicative-expression:
    multiplicative-expression * new-lines~opt~ format-expression
    multiplicative-expression / new-lines~opt~ format-expression
    multiplicative-expression % new-lines~opt~ format-expression
```

### 7.6.1 Multiplication

Description:

The result of the multiplication operator `*` is the product of the values designated by the two
operands after the usual arithmetic conversions ([§6.15][§6.15]) have been applied.

This operator is left associative.

Examples:

```powershell
12 * -10L      # long result -120
-10.300D * 12  # decimal result -123.600
10.6 * 12      # double result 127.2
12 * "0xabc"   # int result 32976
```

### 7.6.2 String replication

Description:

When the left operand designates a string the binary `*` operator creates a new string that contains
the one designated by the left operand replicated the number of times designated by the value of the
right operand as converted to integer type ([§6.4][§6.4]).

This operator is left associative.

Examples:

```powershell
"red" * "3"       # string replicated 3 times
"red" * 4         # string replicated 4 times
"red" * 0         # results in an empty string
"red" * 2.3450D   # string replicated twice
"red" * 2.7       # string replicated 3 times
```

### 7.6.3 Array replication

Description:

When the left operand designates an array the binary `*` operator creates a new unconstrained
1-dimensional array that contains the value designated by the left operand replicated the number of
times designated by the value of the right operand as converted to integer type ([§6.4][§6.4]). A
replication count of zero results in an array of length 1. If the left operand designates a
multidimensional array, it is flattened ([§9.12][§9.12]) before being used.

This operator is left associative.

Examples:

```powershell
$a = [int[]](10,20)              # [int[]], Length 2*1
$a * "3"                         # [object[]], Length 2*3
$a * 4                           # [object[]], Length 2*4
$a * 0                           # [object[]], Length 2*0
$a * 2.3450D                     # [object[]], Length 2*2
$a * 2.7                         # [object[]], Length 2*3
(New-Object 'float[,]' 2,3) * 2  # [object[]], Length 2*2
```

### 7.6.4 Division

Description:

The result of the division operator `/` is the quotient when the value designated by the left
operand is divided by the value designated by the right operand after the usual arithmetic
conversions ([§6.15][§6.15]) have been applied.

If an attempt is made to perform integer or decimal division by zero, an implementation-defined
terminating error is raised.

This operator is left associative.

Examples:

```powershell
10/-10      # int result -1
12/-10      # double result -1.2
12/-10D     # decimal result 1.2
12/10.6     # double result 1.13207547169811
12/"0xabc"  # double result 0.00436681222707424
```

If an attempt is made to perform integer or decimal division by zero, a **RuntimeException**
exception is raised.

### 7.6.5 Remainder

Description:

The result of the remainder operator `%` is the remainder when the value designated by the left
operand is divided by the value designated by the right operand after the usual arithmetic
conversions ([§6.15][§6.15]) have been applied.

If an attempt is made to perform integer or decimal division by zero, an implementation-defined
terminating error is raised.

Examples:

```powershell
10 % 3          # int result 1
10.0 % 0.3      # double result 0.1
10.00D % "0x4"  # decimal result 2.00
```

If an attempt is made to perform integer or decimal division by zero, a **RuntimeException**
exception is raised.

## 7.7 Additive operators

Syntax:

```Syntax
additive-expression:
    primary-expression + new-lines~opt~ expression
    primary-expression dash new-lines~opt~ expression

dash: one of
    - (U+002D)
    EnDash character (U+2013)
    EmDash character (U+2014)
    Horizontal bar character (U+2015)
```

### 7.7.1 Addition

Description:

The result of the addition operator `+` is the sum of the values designated by the two operands
after the usual arithmetic conversions ([§6.15][§6.15]) have been applied.

This operator is left associative.

Examples:

```powershell
12 + -10L       # long result 2
-10.300D + 12   # decimal result 1.700
10.6 + 12       # double result 22.6
12 + "0xabc"    # int result 2760
```

### 7.7.2 String concatenation

Description:

When the left operand designates a string the binary `+` operator creates a new string that contains
the value designated by the left operand followed immediately by the value(s) designated by the
right operand as converted to type string ([§6.8][§6.8]).

This operator is left associative.

Examples:

```powershell
"red" + "blue"      # "redblue"
"red" + "123"       # "red123"
"red" + 123         # "red123"
"red" + 123.456e+5  # "red12345600"
"red" + (20,30,40)  # "red20 30 40"
```

### 7.7.3 Array concatenation

Description:

When the left operand designates an array the binary `+` operator creates a new unconstrained
1-dimensional array that contains the elements designated by the left operand followed immediately
by the value(s) designated by the right operand. Multidimensional arrays present in either operand
are flattened ([§9.12][§9.12]) before being used.

This operator is left associative.

Examples:

```powershell
$a = [int[]](10,20)               # [int[]], Length 2
$a + "red"                        # [object[]], Length 3
$a + 12.5,$true                   # [object[]], Length 4
$a + (New-Object 'float[,]' 2,3)  # [object[]], Length 8
(New-Object 'float[,]' 2,3) + $a  # [object[]], Length 8
```

### 7.7.4 Hashtable concatenation

Description:

When both operands designate Hashtables the binary `+` operator creates a new Hashtable that
contains the elements designated by the left operand followed immediately by the elements designated
by the right operand.

If the Hashtables contain the same key, an implementation-defined terminating error is raised.

This operator is left associative.

Examples:

```powershell
$h1 = @{ FirstName = "James"; LastName = "Anderson" }
$h2 = @{ Dept = "Personnel" }
$h3 = $h1 + $h2      # new Hashtable, Count = 3
```

If the Hashtables contain the same key, an exception of type **BadOperatorArgument** is raised.

### 7.7.5 Subtraction

Description:

The result of the subtraction operator `-` is the difference when the value designated by the right
operand is subtracted from the value designated by the left operand after the usual arithmetic
conversions ([§6.15][§6.15]) have been applied. The subtraction operator can be any one of the
_dash_ characters listed in [§7.7][§7.7].

This operator is left associative.

Examples:

```powershell
12 - -10L      # long result 22
-10.300D - 12  # decimal result -22.300
10.6 - 12      # double result -1.4
12 - "0xabc"   # int result -2736
```

## 7.8 Comparison operators

Syntax:

```Syntax
comparison-expression:
    primary-expression comparison-operator new-lines~opt~ expression

comparison-operator:
    equality-operator
    relational-operator
    containment-operator
    type-operator
    like-operator
    match-operator
```

Description:

The type of the value designated by the left operand determines how the value designated by the
right operand is converted ([§6][§6]), if necessary, before the comparison is done.

Some comparison operators have two variants, one that is case sensitive (`-c<operator>`), and one
that isn't case sensitive (`-i<operator>`). The `-<operator>` version is equivalent to
`-i<operator>`. Case sensitivity is meaningful only with comparisons of values of type string. In
non-string comparison contexts, the two variants behave the same.

These operators are left associative.

### 7.8.1 Equality and relational operators

Syntax:

```Syntax
equality-operator: one of
    dash eq     dash ceq    dash ieq
    dash ne     dash cne    dash ine

dash:
    - (U+002D)
    EnDash character (U+2013)
    EmDash character (U+2014)
    Horizontal bar character (U+2015)

relational-operator: one of
    dash lt     dash clt    dash ilt
    dash le     dash cle    dash ile
    dash gt     dash cgt    dash igt
    dash ge     dash cge    dash ige
```

Description:

There are two equality operators: equality (`-eq`) and inequality (`-ne`); and four
relational operators: less-than (`-lt`), less-than-or-equal-to (`-le`), greater-than (`-gt`), and
greater-than-or-equal-to (`-ge`). Each of these has two variants ([§7.8][§7.8]).

For two strings to compare equal, they must have the same length and contents, and letter case, if
appropriate.

If the value designated by the left operand is not a collection, the result has type `bool`.
Otherwise, the result is a possibly empty unconstrained 1-dimensional array containing the elements
of the collection that test True when compared to the value designated by the right operand.

Examples:

```powershell
10 -eq "010"           # True, int comparison
"010" -eq 10           # False, string comparison
"RED" -eq "Red"        # True, case-insensitive comparison
"RED" -ceq "Red"       # False, case-sensitive comparison
"ab" -lt "abc"         # True

10,20,30,20,10 -ne 20  # 10,30,10, Length 3
10,20,30,20,10 -eq 40  # Length 0
10,20,30,20,10 -ne 40  # 10,20,30,20,10, Length 5
10,20,30,20,10 -gt 25  # 30, Length 1
0,1,30 -ne $true       # 0,30, Length 2
0,"00" -eq "0"         # 0 (int), Length 1
```

### 7.8.2 Containment operators

Syntax:

```Syntax
containment-operator: one of
    dash contains       dash ccontains      dash icontains
    dash notcontains    dash cnotcontains   dash inotcontains
    dash in             dash cin            dash iin
    dash notin          dash cnotin         dash inotin

dash:
    - (U+002D)
    EnDash character (U+2013)
    EmDash character (U+2014)
    Horizontal bar character (U+2015)
```

Description:

There are four containment operators: contains (`-contains`), does-not-contain (`-notcontains`),
in (`-in`) and not-in (`-notin`). Each of these has two variants ([§7.8][§7.8]).

The containment operators return a result of type bool that indicates whether a value occurs (or
does not occur) at least once in the elements of an array. With `-contains` and `-notcontains`, the
value is designated by the right operand and the array is designated by the left operand. With -in
and `-notin`, the operands are reversed. The value is designated by the left operand and the array
is designated by the right operand.

For the purposes of these operators, if the array operand has a scalar value, the scalar value is
treated as an array of one element.

Examples:

```powershell
10,20,30,20,10 -contains 20     # True
10,20,30,20,10 -contains 42.9   # False
10,20,30 -contains "10"         # True
"10",20,30 -contains 10         # True
"010",20,30 -contains 10        # False
10,20,30,20,10 -notcontains 15  # True
"Red",20,30 -ccontains "RED"    # False
```

### 7.8.3 Type testing and conversion operators

Syntax:

```Syntax
type-operator: one of
    dash is
    dash as

dash:
    - (U+002D)
    EnDash character (U+2013)
    EmDash character (U+2014)
    Horizontal bar character (U+2015)
```

Description:

The type operator `-is` tests whether the value designated by the left operand has the type, or is
derived from a type that has the type, designated by the right operand. The right operand must
designate a type or a value that can be converted to a type (such as a string that names a type).
The type of the result is `bool`. The type operator `-isnot` returns the logical negation of the
corresponding `-is` form.

The type operator `-as` attempts to convert the value designated by the left operand to the type
designated by the right operand. The right operand must designate a type or a value that can be
converted to a type (such as a string that names a type). If the conversion fails, `$null` is
returned; otherwise, the converted value is returned and the return type of that result is the
runtime type of the converted value.

Examples:

```powershell
$a = 10            # value 10 has type int
$a -is [int]       # True

$t = [int]
$a -isnot $t       # False
$a -is "int"       # True
$a -isnot [double] # True

$x = [int[]](10,20)
$x -is [int[]]     # True

$a = "abcd"        # string is derived from object
$a -is [object]    # True

$x = [double]
foreach ($t in [int],$x,[decimal],"string") {
    $b = (10.60D -as $t) * 2  # results in int 22, double 21.2
}                             # decimal 21.20, and string "10.6010.60"
```

### 7.8.4 Pattern matching and text manipulation operators

#### 7.8.4.1 The -like and -notlike operators

Syntax:

```Syntax
like-operator: one of
    dash like       dash clike      dash ilike
    dash notlike    dash cnotlike   dash inotlike

dash:
    - (U+002D)
    EnDash character (U+2013)
    EmDash character (U+2014)
    Horizontal bar character (U+2015)
```

Description:

If the left operand does not designate a collection, the result has type `bool`. Otherwise, the
result is a possibly empty unconstrained 1-dimensional array containing the elements of the
collection that test True when compared to the value designated by the right operand. The right
operand may designate a string that contains wildcard expressions ([§3.15][§3.15]). These operators
have two variants ([§7.8][§7.8]).

Examples:

```powershell
"Hello" -like "h*"                   # True, starts with h
"Hello" -clike "h*"                  # False, does not start with lowercase h
"Hello" -like "*l*"                  # True, has an l in it somewhere
"Hello" -like "??l"                  # False, no length match

"-abc" -like "[-xz]*"                # True, - is not a range separator
"#$%\^&" -notlike "*[A-Za-z]"        # True, does not end with alphabetic character
"He" -like "h[aeiou]?*"              # False, need at least 3 characters
"When" -like "*[?]"                  # False, ? is not a wildcard character
"When?" -like "*[?]"                 # True, ? is not a wildcard character

"abc","abbcde","abcgh" -like "abc*"  # object[2], values
"abc" and "abcgh"
```

#### 7.8.4.2 The -match and -notmatch operators

Syntax:

```Syntax
match-operator: one of
    dash match      dash cmatch     dash imatch
    dash notmatch   dash cnotmatch  dash inotmatch

dash:
    - (U+002D)
    EnDash character (U+2013)
    EmDash character (U+2014)
    Horizontal bar character (U+2015)
```

Description:

If the left operand does not designate a collection, the result has type `bool` and if that result
is `$true`, the elements of the Hashtable `$matches` are set to the strings that match (or
do-not-match) the value designated by the right operand. Otherwise, the result is a possibly empty
unconstrained 1-dimensional array containing the elements of the collection that test True when
compared to the value designated by the right operand, and `$matches` is not set. The right operand
may designate a string that contains regular expressions ([§3.16][§3.16]), in which case, it is
referred to as a _pattern_. These operators have two variants ([§7.8][§7.8]).

These operators support submatches ([§7.8.4.6][§7.8.4.6]).

Examples:

```powershell
"Hello" -match ".l"                    # True, $matches key/value is 0/"el"
"Hello" -match '\^h.*o$'               # True, $matches key/value is
0/"Hello"
"Hello" -cmatch '\^h.*o$'              # False, $matches not set
"abc\^ef" -match ".\\\^e"              # True, $matches key/value is 0/"c\^e"

"abc" -notmatch "[A-Za-z]"             # False
"abc" -match "[\^A-Za-z]"              # False
"He" -match "h[aeiou]."                # False, need at least 3 characters
"abc","abbcde","abcgh" -match "abc.*"  # Length is 2, values "abc", "abcgh"
```

#### 7.8.4.3 The -replace operator

Syntax:

```Syntax
binary-replace-operator: one of
    dash replace    dash creplace   dash ireplace

dash:
    - (U+002D)
    EnDash character (U+2013)
    EmDash character (U+2014)
    Horizontal bar character (U+2015)
```

Description:

The `-replace` operator allows text replacement in one or more strings designated by the left
operand using the values designated by the right operand. This operator has two variants
([§7.8][§7.8]). The right operand has one of the following forms:

- The string to be located, which may contain regular expressions ([§3.16][§3.16]). In this case,
  the replacement string is implicitly "".
- An array of 2 objects containing the string to be located, followed by the replacement string.

If the left operand designates a string, the result has type string. If the left operand designates
a 1-dimensional array of string, the result is an unconstrained 1-dimensional array, whose length is
the same as for left operand's array, containing the input strings after replacement has completed.

This operator supports submatches ([§7.8.4.6][§7.8.4.6]).

Examples:

```powershell
"Analogous","an apple" -replace "a","*"      # "*n*logous","*n *pple"
"Analogous" -creplace "[aeiou]","?"          # "An?l?g??s"
"Analogous","an apple" -replace '\^a',"%%A"  # "%%Analogous","%%An apple"
"Analogous" -replace "[aeiou]",'$&$&'        # "AAnaaloogoouus"
```

#### 7.8.4.4 The binary -join operator

Syntax:

```Syntax
binary-join-operator: one of
    dash join

dash:
    - (U+002D)
    EnDash character (U+2013)
    EmDash character (U+2014)
    Horizontal bar character (U+2015)
```

Description:

The binary `-join` operator produces a string that is the concatenation of the value of one or more
objects designated by the left operand after having been converted to string ([§6.7][§6.7]), if
necessary. The string designated by the right operand is used to separate the (possibly empty)
values in the resulting string.

The left operand can be a scalar value or a collection.

Examples:

```powershell
(10, 20, 30) -join "\|"    # result is "10\|20\|30"
12345 -join ","            # result is "12345", no separator needed
($null,$null) -join "<->"  # result is "<->", two zero-length values
```

#### 7.8.4.5 The binary -split operator

Syntax:

```Syntax
binary-split-operator: one of
    dash split      dash csplit     dash isplit

dash:
    - (U+002D)
    EnDash character (U+2013)
    EmDash character (U+2014)
    Horizontal bar character (U+2015)
```

Description:

The binary `-split` operator splits one or more strings designated by the left operand, returning
their subparts in a constrained 1-dimensional array of string. This operator has two variants
([§7.8][§7.8]). The left operand can designate a scalar value or an array of strings. The right
operand has one of the following forms:

- A _delimiter string_
- An array of 2 objects containing a delimiter string followed by a numeric _split count_
- An array of 3 objects containing a delimiter string, a numeric split count, and an _options
  string_
- A script block
- An array of 2 objects containing a script block followed by a numeric split count

The delimiter string may contain regular expressions ([§3.16][§3.16]). It is used to locate subparts
with the input strings. The delimiter is not included in the resulting strings. If the left operand
designates an empty string, that results in an empty string element. If the delimiter string is an
empty string, it is found at every character position in the input strings.

By default, all subparts of the input strings are placed into the result as separate elements;
however, the split count can be used to modify this behavior. If that count is negative, zero, or
greater than or equal to the number of subparts in an input string, each subpart goes into a
separate element. If that count is less than the number of subparts in the input string, there are
count elements in the result, with the final element containing all of the subparts beyond the first
**count - 1** subparts.

An options string contains zero or more _option names_ with each adjacent pair separated by a comma.
Leading, trailing, and embedded whitespace is ignored. Option names may be in any order and are
case-sensitive.

If an options string contains the option name **SimpleMatch**, it may also contain the option name
**IgnoreCase**. If an options string contains the option name **RegexMatch** or it does not contain
either **RegexMatch** or **SimpleMatch**, it may contain any option name except **SimpleMatch**.
However, it must not contain both **Multiline** and **Singleline**.

Here is the set of option names:

|       **Option**        |                                           **Description**                                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CultureInvariant        | Ignores cultural differences in language when evaluating the delimiter.                              |
| ExplicitCapture         | Ignores non-named match groups so that only explicit capture groups are returned in the result list. |
| IgnoreCase              | Force case-insensitive matching, even if `-csplit` is used.                                          |
| IgnorePatternWhitespace | Ignores unescaped whitespace and comments marked with the number sign (`#`).                         |
| Multiline               | This mode recognizes the start and end of lines and strings. The default mode is **Singleline**.     |
| RegexMatch              | Use regular expression matching to evaluate the delimiter. This is the default.                      |
| SimpleMatch             | Use simple string comparison when evaluating the delimiter.                                          |
| Singleline              | This mode recognizes only the start and end of strings. It is the default mode.                      |

The script block ([§7.1.8][§7.1.8]) specifies the rules for determining the delimiter, and must
evaluate to type bool.

Examples:

```powershell
"one,forty two,," -split ","              # 5 strings: "one" "forty two" "" ""

"abc","de" -split ""                      # 9 strings: "" "a" "b" "c" "" "" "d" "e" ""

"ab,cd","1,5,7,8" -split ",", 2           # 4 strings: "ab" "cd" "1" "5,7,8"

"10X20x30" -csplit "X", 0, "SimpleMatch"  # 2 strings: "10" "20x30"

"analogous" -split "[AEIOU]", 0, "RegexMatch, IgnoreCase"
                                          # 6 strings: "" "n" "l" "g" "" "s"

"analogous" -split { $_ -eq "a" -or $_ -eq "o" }, 4
                                          # 4 strings: "" "n" "l" "gous"
```

#### 7.8.4.6 Submatches

The pattern being matched by `-match`, `-notmatch`, and `-replace` may contain subparts (called
_submatches_) delimited by parentheses. Consider the following example:

`"red" -match "red"`

The result is `$true` and key 0 of `$matches` contains "red", that part of the string designated by
the left operand that exactly matched the pattern designated by the right operand.

In the following example, the whole pattern is a submatch:

`"red" -match "(red)"`

As before, key 0 contains "red"; however, key 1 also contains "red", which is that part of the
string designated by the left operand that exactly matched the submatch.

Consider the following, more complex, pattern:

`"red" -match "((r)e)(d)"`

This pattern allows submatches of "re", "r", "d", or "red".

Again, key 0 contains "red". Key 1 contains "re", key 2 contains "r", and key 3 contains "d". The
key/value pairs are in matching order from left-to-right in the pattern, with longer string matches
preceding shorter ones.

In the case of `-replace`, the replacement text can access the submatches via names of the form
`$n`, where the first match is `$1`, the second is `$3`, and so on. For example,

```powershell
"Monday morning" -replace '(Monday|Tuesday) (morning|afternoon|evening)','the $2 of $1'
```

The resulting string is "the morning of Monday".

Instead of having keys in `$matches` be zero-based indexes, submatches can be named using the form
`?<*name*>`. For example, `"((r)e)(d)"` can be written with three named submatches, `m1`, `m2`, and
`m3`, as follows: `"(?<m1>(?<m2>r)e)(?<m3>d)"`.

### 7.8.5 Shift operators

Syntax:

```Syntax
shift-operator: one of
    dash shl
    dash shr

dash:
    - (U+002D)
    EnDash character (U+2013)
    EmDash character (U+2014)
    Horizontal bar character (U+2015)
```

Description:

The shift left (`-shl`) operator and shift right (`-shr`) operator convert the value designed by the
left operand to an integer type and the value designated by the right operand to int, if necessary,
using the usual arithmetic conversions ([§6.15][§6.15]).

The shift left operator shifts the left operand left by a number of bits computed as described
below. The low-order empty bit positions are set to zero.

The shift right operator shifts the left operand right by a number of bits computed as described
below. The low-order bits of the left operand are discarded, the remaining bits shifted right. When
the left operand is a signed value, the high-order empty bit positions are set to zero if the left
operand is non-negative and set to one if the left operand is negative. When the left operand is an
unsigned value, the high-order empty bit positions are set to zero.

When the left operand has type int, the shift count is given by the low-order five bits of the right
operand. When the right operand has type long, the shift count is given by the low-order six bits of
the right operand.

Examples:

```powershell
0x0408 -shl 1             # int with value 0x0810
0x0408 -shr 3             # int with value 0x0081
0x100000000 -shr 0xfff81  # long with value 0x80000000
```

## 7.9 Bitwise operators

Syntax:

```Syntax
bitwise-expression:
    unary-expression -band new-lines~opt~ unary-expression
    unary-expression -bor new-lines~opt~ unary-expression
    unary-expression -bxor new-lines~opt~ unary-expression
```

Description:

The bitwise AND operator `-band`, the bitwise OR operator `-bor`, and the bitwise XOR operator
`-bxor` convert the values designated by their operands to integer types, if necessary, using the
usual arithmetic conversions ([§6.15][§6.15]). After conversion, if both values have type int that
is the type of the result. Otherwise, if both values have type long, that is the type of the result.
If one value has type **int** and the other has type long, the type of the result is long.
Otherwise, the expression is ill formed. The result is the bitwise AND, bitwise OR, or bitwise XOR,
respectively, of the possibly converted operand values.

These operators are left associative. They are commutative if neither operand contains a side
effect.

Examples:

```powershell
0x0F0F -band 0xFE    # int with value 0xE
0x0F0F -band 0xFEL   # long with value 0xE
0x0F0F -band 14.6    # long with value 0xF

0x0F0F -bor 0xFE     # int with value 0xFFF
0x0F0F -bor 0xFEL    # long with value 0xFFF
0x0F0F -bor 14.40D   # long with value 0xF0F

## 7.10 Logical operators

Syntax:

```Syntax
logical-expression:
    unary-expression -and new-lines~opt~ unary-expression
    unary-expression -or new-lines~opt~ unary-expression
    unary-expression -xor new-lines~opt~ unary-expression
```

Description:

The logical AND operator `-and` converts the values designated by its operands to `bool`, if
necessary ([§6.2][§6.2]). The result is the logical AND of the possibly converted operand values,
and has type `bool`. If the left operand evaluates to False the right operand is not evaluated.

The logical OR operator `-or` converts the values designated by its operands to `bool`, if necessary
([§6.2][§6.2]). The result is the logical OR of the possibly converted operand values, and has type
`bool`. If the left operand evaluates to True the right operand is not evaluated.

The logical XOR operator `-xor` converts the values designated by its operands to `bool`
([§6.2][§6.2]). The result is the logical XOR of the possibly converted operand values, and has type
`bool`.

These operators are left associative.

Examples:

```powershell
$j = 10
$k = 20
($j -gt 5) -and (++$k -lt 15)   # True -and False -> False
($j -gt 5) -and ($k -le 21)     # True -and True -> True
($j++ -gt 5) -and ($j -le 10)   # True -and False -> False
($j -eq 5) -and (++$k -gt 15)   # False -and True -> False

$j = 10
$k = 20
($j++ -gt 5) -or (++$k -lt 15)  # True -or False -> True
($j -eq 10) -or ($k -gt 15)     # False -or True -> True
($j -eq 10) -or (++$k -le 20)   # False -or False -> False

$j = 10
$k = 20
($j++ -gt 5) -xor (++$k -lt 15) # True -xor False -> True
($j -eq 10) -xor ($k -gt 15)    # False -xor True -> True
($j -gt 10) -xor (++$k -le 25)  # True -xor True -> False
```

## 7.11 Assignment operators

Syntax:

```Syntax
assignment-expression:
    expression assignment-operator statement

assignment-operator: *one of
    =   dash =   +=   *=   /=   %=
```

Description:

An assignment operator stores a value in the writable location designated by _expression_. For a
discussion of _assignment-operator_ `=` see [§7.11.1][§7.11.1]. For a discussion of all other
assignment operators see [§7.11.2][§7.11.2].

An assignment expression has the value designated by _expression_ after the assignment has taken
place; however, that assignment expression does not itself designate a writable location. If
_expression_ is type-constrained ([§5.3][§5.3]), the type used in that constraint is the type of the
result; otherwise, the type of the result is the type after the usual arithmetic conversions
([§6.15][§6.15]) have been applied.

This operator is right associative.

### 7.11.1 Simple assignment

Description:

In _simple assignment_ (`=`), the value designated by _statement_ replaces the value stored in the
writable location designated by _expression_. However, if _expression_ designates a non-existent key
in a Hashtable, that key is added to the Hashtable with an associated value of the value designated
by _statement_.

As shown by the grammar, _expression_ may designate a comma-separated list of writable locations.
This is known as _multiple assignment_. _statement_ designates a list of one or more comma-separated
values. The commas in either operand list are part of the multiple-assignment syntax and do _not_
represent the binary comma operator. Values are taken from the list designated by _statement_, in
lexical order, and stored in the corresponding writable location designated by _expression_. If the
list designated by _statement_ has fewer values than there are _expression_ writable locations, the
excess locations take on the value `$null`. If the list designated by _statement_ has more values
than there are _expression_ writable locations, all but the right-most _expression_ location take on
the corresponding _statement_ value and the right-most _expression_ location becomes an
unconstrained 1-dimensional array with all the remaining _statement_ values as elements.

For statements that have values ([§8.1.2][§8.1.2]), _statement_ can be a statement.

Examples:

```powershell
$a = 20; $b = $a + 12L             # $b has type long, value 22
$hypot = [Math]::Sqrt(3*3 + 4*4)   # type double, value 5
$a = $b = $c = 10.20D              # all have type decimal, value 10.20
$a = (10,20,30),(1,2)              # type [object[]], Length 2
[int]$x = 10.6                     # type int, value 11
[long]$x = "0xabc"                 # type long, value 0xabc
$a = [float]                       # value type literal [float]
$i,$j,$k = 10,"red",$true          # $i is 10, $j is "red", $k is True
$i,$j = 10,"red",$true             # $i is 10, $j is [object[]], Length 2
$i,$j = (10,"red"),$true           # $i is [object[]], Length 2, $j is True
$i,$j,$k = 10                      # $i is 10, $j is $null, $k is $null

$h = @{}
[int] $h.Lower, [int] $h.Upper = -split "10 100"

$h1 = @{ FirstName = "James"; LastName = "Anderson"; IDNum = 123 }
$h1.Dept = "Finance"               # adds element Finance
$h1["City"] = "New York"           # adds element City

[int]$Variable:v = 123.456         # v takes on the value 123
${E:output.txt} = "a"              # write text to the given file
$Env:MyPath = "x:\data\file.txt"   # define the environment variable
$Function:F = { param ($a, $b) "Hello there, $a, $b" }
F 10 "red"                         # define and invoke a function
function Demo { "Hi there from inside Demo" }
$Alias:A = "Demo"                  # create alias for function Demo
A                                  # invoke function Demo via the alias
```

### 7.11.2 Compound assignment

Description:

A _compound assignment_ has the form `E1 op= E2`, and is equivalent to the simple assignment
expression `E1 = E1 op (E2)` except that in the compound assignment case the expression _E1_ is
evaluated only once. If _expression_ is type-constrained ([§5.3][§5.3]), the type used in that
constraint is the type of the result; otherwise, the type of the result is determined by _op_. For
`*=`, see [§7.6.1][§7.6.1], [§7.6.2][§7.6.2], [§7.6.3][§7.6.3]; for `/=`, see [§7.6.4][§7.6.4]; for
`%=`, see [§7.6.5][§7.6.5]; for `+=`, see [§7.7.1][§7.7.1], [§7.7.2][§7.7.2], [§7.7.3][§7.7.3]; for
`-=`, see [§7.7.5][§7.7.5].

> [!NOTE]
> An operand designating an unconstrained value of numeric type may have its type changed by an
> assignment operator when the result is stored.

Examples:

```powershell
$a = 1234; $a *= (3 + 2)  # type is int, value is 1234 * (3 + 2)
$b = 10,20,30             # $b[1] has type int, value 20
$b[1] /= 6                # $b[1] has type double, value 3.33...

$i = 0
$b = 10,20,30
$b[++$i] += 2             # side effect evaluated only once

[int]$Variable:v = 10     # v takes on the value 10
$Variable:v -= 3          # 3 is subtracted from v

${E:output.txt} = "a"     # write text to the given file
${E:output.txt} += "b"    # append text to the file giving ab
${E:output.txt} *= 4      # replicate ab 4 times giving abababab
```

## 7.12 Redirection operators

Syntax:

```Syntax
pipeline:
    expression redirections~opt~ pipeline-tail~opt~
    command verbatim-command-argument~opt~ pipeline-tail~opt~

redirections:
    redirection
    redirections redirection

redirection:
    merging-redirection-operator
    file-redirection-operator redirected-file-name

redirected-file-name:
    command-argument
    primary-expression

file-redirection-operator: one of
    >   >>   2>   2>>   3>   3>>   4>   4>>
    5>  5>>  6>   6>>   >    >>    <

merging-redirection-operator: one of
    >&1   2>&1   3>&1   4>&1   5>&1   6>&1
    >&2   1>&2   3>&2   4>&2   5>&2   6>&2
```

Description:

The redirection operator `>` takes the standard output from the pipeline and redirects it to the
location designated by _redirected-file-name_, overwriting that location's current contents.

The redirection operator `>>` takes the standard output from the pipeline and redirects it to the
location designated by _redirected-file-name_, appending to that location's current contents, if
any. If that location does not exist, it is created.

The redirection operator with the form `n>` takes the output of stream _n_ from the pipeline and
redirects it to the location designated by _redirected-file-name_, overwriting that location's
current contents.

The redirection operator with the form `n>>` takes the output of stream _n_ from the pipeline and
redirects it to the location designated by _redirected-file-name_, appending to that location's
current contents, if any. If that location does not exist, it is created.

The redirection operator with the form `m>&n` writes output from stream _m_ to the same location as
stream _n_.

The following are the valid streams:

| Stream |                                       Description                                       |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Standard output stream                                                                  |
| 2      | Error output stream                                                                     |
| 3      | Warning output stream                                                                   |
| 4      | Verbose output stream                                                                   |
| 5      | Debug output stream                                                                     |
| *      | Standard output, error output, warning output, verbose output, and debug output streams |

The redirection operators `1>&2`, `6>`, `6>>` and `<` are reserved for future use.

If on output the value of _redirected-file-name_ is `$null`, the output is discarded.

Ordinarily, the value of an expression containing a top-level side effect is not written to the
pipeline unless that expression is enclosed in a pair of parentheses. However, if such an expression
is the left operand of an operator that redirects standard output, the value is written.

Examples:

```powershell
$i = 200                       # pipeline gets nothing
$i                             # pipeline gets result
$i > output1.txt               # result redirected to named file
++$i >> output1.txt            # result appended to named file
type file1.txt 2> error1.txt   # error output redirected to named file
type file2.txt 2>> error1.txt  # error output appended to named file
dir -Verbose 4> verbose1.txt   # verbose output redirected to named file

# Send all output to output2.txt
dir -Verbose -Debug -WarningAction Continue *> output2.txt

# error output redirected to named file, verbose output redirected
# to the same location as error output
dir -Verbose 4>&2 2> error2.txt
```
