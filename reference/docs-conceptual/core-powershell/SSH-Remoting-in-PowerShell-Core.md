# PowerShell Remoting Over SSH

## Overview

PowerShell remoting normally uses WinRM for connection negotiation and data transport. SSH is now available for Linux and Windows platforms and allows true multiplatform PowerShell remoting.

WinRM provides a robust hosting model for PowerShell remote sessions. which this implementation
SSH-based remoting doesn't currently support remote endpoint configuration and JEA (Just Enough
Administration).

SSH remoting lets you do basic PowerShell session remoting between Windows and Linux machines. SSH Remoting creates a PowerShell host process on the target machine as an SSH subsystem.
Eventually we'll implement a general hosting model, similar to WinRM, to support endpoint
configuration and JEA.

The `New-PSSession`, `Enter-PSSession`, and `Invoke-Command` cmdlets now have a new parameter set to
support this new remoting connection.

```
[-HostName <string>]  [-UserName <string>]  [-KeyFilePath <string>]
```

To create a remote session, you specify the target machine with the `HostName` parameter and
provide the user name with `UserName`. When running the cmdlets interactively, you're prompted for
a password. You can also, use SSH key authentication using a private key file with the
`KeyFilePath` parameter.

## General setup information

SSH must be installed on all machines. Install both the SSH client (`ssh.exe`) and
server (`sshd.exe`) so that you can remote to and from the machines. For Windows, install
[Win32 OpenSSH from GitHub](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases).
For Linux, install SSH (including sshd server) appropriate to your platform. You also need to
install PowerShell Core from GitHub to get the SSH remoting feature. The SSH server must be
configured to create an SSH subsystem to host a PowerShell process on the remote machine. You also
must configure enable password or key-based authentication.

## Set up on Windows Machine

1. Install the latest version of [PowerShell Core for Windows]

   - You can tell if it has the SSH remoting support by looking at the parameter sets for
     `New-PSSession`

   ```powershell
   Get-Command New-PSSession -syntax
   ```

   ```output
   New-PSSession [-HostName] <string[]> [-Name <string[]>] [-UserName <string>] [-KeyFilePath <string>] [-SSHTransport] [<CommonParameters>]
   ```

2. Install the latest [Win32 OpenSSH] build from GitHub using the [installation] instructions
3. Edit the sshd_config file at the location where you installed Win32 OpenSSH

   - Make sure password authentication is enabled

     ```
     PasswordAuthentication yes
     ```

     ```
     Subsystem    powershell c:/program files/powershell/6.0.4/pwsh.exe -sshs -NoLogo -NoProfile
     ```

     > [!NOTE]
     > There is a bug in OpenSSH for Windows that prevents spaces from working in subsystem
     > executable paths. For more information, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/784).

     One solution is to create a symlink to the Powershell installation directory that doesn't have spaces:

     ```powershell
     mklink /D c:\pwsh "C:\Program Files\PowerShell\6.0.4"
     ```

     and then enter it in the subsystem:

     ```
     Subsystem    powershell c:\pwsh\pwsh.exe -sshs -NoLogo -NoProfile
     ```

   - Optionally enable key authentication

     ```
     PubkeyAuthentication yes
     ```

4. Restart the sshd service

   ```powershell
   Restart-Service sshd
   ```

5. Add the path where OpenSSH is installed to your Path environment variable. For example,
   `C:\Program Files\OpenSSH\`. This entry allows for the ssh.exe to be found.

## Set up on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) Machine

1. Install the latest [PowerShell Core for Linux] build from GitHub
2. Install [Ubuntu SSH] as needed

   ```bash
   sudo apt install openssh-client
   sudo apt install openssh-server
   ```

3. Edit the sshd_config file at location /etc/ssh

   - Make sure password authentication is enabled

   ```
   PasswordAuthentication yes
   ```

   - Add a PowerShell subsystem entry

   ```
   Subsystem powershell /usr/bin/pwsh -sshs -NoLogo -NoProfile
   ```

   - Optionally enable key authentication

   ```
   PubkeyAuthentication yes
   ```

4. Restart the sshd service

   ```bash
   sudo service sshd restart
   ```

## Set up on MacOS Machine

1. Install the latest [PowerShell Core for MacOS] build

   - Make sure SSH Remoting is enabled by following these steps:
     - Open `System Preferences`
     - Click on `Sharing`
     - Check `Remote Login` - Should say `Remote Login: On`
     - Allow access to appropriate users

2. Edit the `sshd_config` file at location `/private/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

   - Use your favorite editor or

     ```bash
     sudo nano /private/etc/ssh/sshd_config
     ```

   - Make sure password authentication is enabled

     ```
     PasswordAuthentication yes
     ```

   - Add a PowerShell subsystem entry

     ```
     Subsystem powershell /usr/local/bin/pwsh -sshs -NoLogo -NoProfile
     ```

   - Optionally enable key authentication

     ```
     PubkeyAuthentication yes
     ```

3. Restart the sshd service

   ```bash
   sudo launchctl stop com.openssh.sshd
   sudo launchctl start com.openssh.sshd
   ```

## PowerShell Remoting Example

The easiest way to test remoting is to try it on a single machine. In this example, we create a
remote session back to the same Linux machine. We are using PowerShell cmdlets interactively so we
see prompts from SSH asking to verify the host computer and prompting for a password. You can do
the same thing on a Windows machine to ensure remoting is working. Then remote between machines by
changing the host name.

```powershell
#
# Linux to Linux
#
$session = New-PSSession -HostName UbuntuVM1 -UserName TestUser
```

```output
The authenticity of host 'UbuntuVM1 (9.129.17.107)' cannot be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:2kCbnhT2dUE6WCGgVJ8Hyfu1z2wE4lifaJXLO7QJy0Y.
