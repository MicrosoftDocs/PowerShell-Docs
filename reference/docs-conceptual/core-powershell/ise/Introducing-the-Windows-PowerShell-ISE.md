# Introducing the Windows PowerShell ISE

The Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) is a host application for Windows
PowerShell. In Windows PowerShell ISE, you can run commands and write, test, and debug scripts in a
single Windows-based graphic user interface. The interface provides multiline editing, tab
completion, syntax coloring, selective execution, context-sensitive help, and support for
right-to-left languages. Menu items and keyboard shortcuts are mapped to many of the same tasks
that you would do in the Windows PowerShell console. For example, when you debug a script in the
Windows PowerShell ISE, you can right-click on a line of code to set a breakpoint.

Try these features in Windows PowerShell ISE.

- Multiline editing: To insert a blank line under the current line in the Command pane, press
  SHIFT+ENTER.
- Selective execution: To run part of a script, select the text you want to run, and then click the
  **Run Script** button. Or, press F5.
- Context-sensitive help: Type **Invoke-Item**, and then press F1. The Help file opens to the
  article for the **Invoke-Item** cmdlet.

The Windows PowerShell ISE lets you customize some aspects of its appearance. It also has its own
Windows PowerShell profile script.

## To start the Windows PowerShell ISE

Click **Start**, select **Windows PowerShell**, and then click **Windows PowerShell ISE**.
Alternately, you can type `powershell_ise.exe` in any command shell or in the Run box.

## To get Help in the Windows PowerShell ISE

On the **Help** menu, click **Windows PowerShell Help**. Or, press F1. The file that opens
describes Windows PowerShell ISE and Windows PowerShell, including all of the help available from
the Get-Help cmdlet.
