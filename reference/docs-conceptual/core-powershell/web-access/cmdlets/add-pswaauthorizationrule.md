## DESCRIPTION

The **Add-PswaAuthorizationRule** cmdlet adds a new authorization rule
to the Windows PowerShell® Web Access authorization rule set.

You must specify the users, computers, and Windows PowerShell endpoints
for this rule. You can specify both users and computers either by
individual user accounts and computer names, or by specifying groups.

For a computer that is joined to an Active Directory domain, the cmdlet
uses the security identifier (SID) of the computer to create the rule.
This allows you to use a short name, a fully qualified domain name
(FQDN), or an IP address for the **Computer Name** field on the sign-in
page.

For a computer that is not joined to an Active Directory domain, the
cmdlet creates the rule using the computer name provided by the
administrator. To successfully connect to this machine, the end user
must provide the computer name exactly as it appears in the rule.

If there are multiple computers with the same name on the network, then
short name can resolve to more than one computer. This can lead to
ambiguity when establishing a connection. For example, if a rule exists
for the workgroup computer named "*Server1*” and a new computer named
*server1.contoso.com* is joined to the network, validation using the
authorization rules succeeds and Windows PowerShell Web Access attempts
to establish a connection to the computer named “*Server1*”. It is not
guaranteed that the connection is established with the specified
workgroup computer; the attempt could be made on either the workgroup or
the domain computer named "*Server1*". To reduce ambiguity, it is
recommended that you use the FQDN for the destination computer whenever
possible to create an authorization rule.

The authorization rules evaluate the primary sign-in credential of the
Windows PowerShell Web Access users, not the alternate credentials (the
second set of credentials found in the **Optional connection settings**
section of the sign-in page). For an example of this, see Example 6.

## Parameters

### -ComputerGroupName \<String\>

Specifies the name of a computer group in Active Directory Domain

### -Credential  \<PSCredential\>

Specifies a **PSCredential** object for a user account that you want to
use to change Windows PowerShell Web Access authorization rules. If you
do not add this parameter, the cmdlet uses the currently logged-on user
account. To get a **PSCredential** object, which is required to add
authorization rules remotely, run the
[Get-Credential](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/reference/5.1/microsoft.powershell.security/Get-Credential) cmdlet.

### -Force

Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.\
In addition, it also prompts for confirmation when you enter a simple or
short computer name (such as a name that is not a domain name or is not
fully qualified). Confirmation is requested for security reasons, so
that you can use the simple name to add a computer only if the computer
is in a workgroup.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1

This example grants access to the session configuration _PSWAEndpoint_,
a restricted runspace, on _srv2_ for users in the _SMAdmins_ group.

> [!NOTE]
> The computer name must be a fully qualified domain name
> (FQDN). Administrators define a restricted session configuration or
> runspace, which is a limited range of cmdlets and tasks that end users
> can run. Defining a restricted runspace can prevent users from accessing
> other computers that are not in the allowed Windows PowerShell®
> runspace, thus offering a more secure connection. For more information
> on session configurations, see
> [about_Session_Configurations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/reference/5.1/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_session_configurations)
> or the [Install and Use Windows PowerShell Web Access](../install-and-use-windows-powershell-web-access.md).

```PowerShell
Add-PswaAuthorizationRule -ComputerName srv2.contoso.com -UserGroupName contoso\SMAdmins -ConfigurationName PSWAEndpoint
```

### EXAMPLE 2

This example grants access to the default Windows PowerShell session
configuration, `Microsoft.PowerShell`, on *srv2* for users in the users
named `contoso\user1`, `contoso\user2`, and `contoso\user3`. This cmdlet
creates three rules (1 per person).

```PowerShell
Add-PswaAuthorizationRule –UserName contoso\user1, contoso\user2, contoso\user3 –ComputerName srv2.contoso.com -ConfigurationName Microsoft.PowerShell
```

### EXAMPLE 3

This example illustrates how to input user name values via the pipeline.

```powershell
"contoso\user1","contoso\user2" | Add-pswaAuthorizationRule –ComputerName srv2.contoso.com –ConfigurationName Microsoft.PowerShell
```

### EXAMPLE 4

This example illustrates how all parameters take values from pipeline by
property name.

````PowerShell
$o = New-Object -TypeName PSObject |
    Add-Member -Type NoteProperty -Name "UserName" -Value "contoso\user1" -PassThru |
    Add-Member -Type NoteProperty -Name "ComputerName" -Value "srv2.contoso.com" -PassThru |
    Add-Member -Type NoteProperty -Name "ConfigurationName" -Value "Microsoft.PowerShell" –PassThru

$o | Add-PswaAuthorizationRule -UserName contoso\user1 -ConfigurationName Microsoft.PowerShell
````

### EXAMPLE 5

This example adds a rule to allow the local user named
`PswaServer\ChrisLocal` access to the server named **srv1.contoso.com**.

This example illustrates a scenario where the gateway is in a workgroup
and the destination computer is in a domain. The authorization rule
applies to the local users on the gateway. On the Windows PowerShell Web
Access sign-in page, to successfully authenticate, the user must provide
a second set of credentials in the **Optional connection settings**
area. The gateway server uses the additional set of credentials to
authenticate the user on the destination computer, a server named
*srv1.contoso.com*.

````powershell
Add-PswaAuthorizationRule –UserName PswaServer\ChrisLocal –ComputerName srv1.contoso.com –ConfigurationName Microsoft.PowerShell
````

### EXAMPLE 6

This example allows all users access to all endpoints on all computers.
This essentially turns off authorization rules.

> [!NOTE]
> Use of the `*` wildcard character is not recommended for
> security-sensitive deployments and should only be considered for test
> environments or used in deployments where security can be relaxed.

````PowerShell
Add-PswaAuthorizationRule –UserName * -ComputerName * -ConfigurationName *
````
