# Scripting with PowerShell

PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language designed especially for system administration. Built on the .NET Framework, PowerShell helps IT professionals and power users automate the administrative tasks.

PowerShell commands, called *cmdlets*, let you manage computers from the command line. PowerShell *providers* let you access data such as the registry and certificate store, as easily as you access the file system. PowerShell includes a rich expression parser and a fully developed scripting language.

PowerShell includes the following features:

- Cmdlets for managing the registry, services, processes, event logs, and other common system administration tasks.
- A task-based scripting language and support for existing scripts and command-line tools.
- A consistent design that enables easy data sharing. Output from one cmdlet can be used as the input to another cmdlet without reformatting or manipulation.
- Simplified, command-based navigation that lets you navigate the registry and other data stores using the same techniques you use to navigate the file system.
- Everything is an object. Makes it easy to use, display, and store data.
- Extensible interface. Independent software vendors and enterprise developers can build custom tools and utilities to administer their software.
