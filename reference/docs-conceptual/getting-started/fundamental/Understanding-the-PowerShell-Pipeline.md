# Understanding pipelines

Pipelines act like a series of connected segments of pipe. Items moving along the pipeline pass
through each segment. To create a pipeline in PowerShell, you connect commands together
with the pipe operator "|". The output of each command is used as input to the next command.

The notation used for pipelines is similar to the notation used in other shells. At first glance, it
may not be apparent how pipelines are different in PowerShell. Although you see text on the screen,
PowerShell pipes objects, not text, between commands.

## The PowerShell pipeline

Pipelines are arguably the most valuable concept used in command-line interfaces. When used
properly, pipelines reduce the effort of using complex commands and make it easier to see the flow
of work for the commands. Each command in a pipeline (called a pipeline element) passes its output
to the next command in the pipeline, item-by-item. Commands don't have to handle more than one item
at a time. The result is reduced resource consumption and the ability to begin getting the output
immediately.

For example, if you use the `Out-Host` cmdlet to force a page-by-page display of output from
another command, the output looks just like the normal text displayed on the screen, broken up into
pages:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\WINDOWS\System32 | Out-Host -Paging
```

```Output
    Directory: C:\WINDOWS\system32

```

Paging also reduces CPU utilization because processing transfers to the `Out-Host` cmdlet when it
has a complete page ready to display. The cmdlets that precede it in the pipeline pause execution
until the next page of output is available.

You can see the difference Windows Task Manager to monitor CPU and memory used by PowerShell. Run
the following command: `Get-ChildItem C:\Windows -Recurse`. Compare the CPU and memory usage to
this command: `Get-ChildItem C:\Windows -Recurse | Out-Host -Paging`.

## Objects in the pipeline

When you run a cmdlet in PowerShell, you see text output because it is necessary to represent
objects as text in a console window. The text output may not display all of the properties of the object being output.

For example, consider the `Get-Location` cmdlet. If you run `Get-Location` while
your current location is the root of the C drive, you see the following output:

```
PS> Get-Location

Path
----
C:\
```

The text output is a summary of information, not a complete representation of the object returned
by `Get-Location`. The heading in the output is added by the process that formats the data for
onscreen display.

When you pipe the output to the `Get-Member` cmdlet you get information about the object returned by
`Get-Location`.

```powershell
PS> Get-Location | Get-Member
```

```Output
   TypeName: System.Management.Automation.PathInfo

Name         MemberType Definition
----         ---------- ----------
Equals       Method     bool Equals(System.Object obj)
GetHashCode  Method     int GetHashCode()
GetType      Method     type GetType()
ToString     Method     string ToString()
Drive        Property   System.Management.Automation.PSDriveInfo Drive {get;}
Path         Property   string Path {get;}
Provider     Property   System.Management.Automation.ProviderInfo Provider {get;}
ProviderPath Property   string ProviderPath {get;}
```

`Get-Location` returns a **PathInfo** object that contains the current path and other information.
