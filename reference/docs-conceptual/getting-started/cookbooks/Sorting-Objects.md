# Sorting Objects

We can organize displayed data to make it easier to scan by using the **Sort-Object** cmdlet. **Sort-Object** takes the name of one or more properties to sort on, and returns data sorted by the values of those properties.

Consider the problem of listing Win32_SystemDriver instances. If we want to sort by **State** and then by **Name**, we can do it by typing:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_SystemDriver | Sort-Object -Property State,Name | Format-Table -Property Name,State,Started,DisplayName -AutoSize -Wrap
```

Although this is a lengthy display, you can see items with the same state grouped together:

```output
Name           State   Started DisplayName
----           -----   ------- -----------
ACPI           Running    True Microsoft ACPI Driver
AFD            Running    True AFD
AmdK7          Running    True AMD K7 Processor Driver
AsyncMac       Running    True RAS Asynchronous Media Driver
...
Abiosdsk       Stopped   False Abiosdsk
ACPIEC         Stopped   False ACPIEC
aec            Stopped   False Microsoft Kernel Acoustic Echo Canceller
...
```

You can also sort the objects in reverse order by specifying the **Descending** parameter. This reverses the sort order so that names are sorted in reverse alphabetical order and numbers are sorted by descending size.

```
