# Product terminology and branding guidelines

When writing about any product it's important to correctly and consistently use product names and
terminology. This guide defines product names and terminology related to PowerShell. Note the
capitalization of specific words or use cases.

## PowerShell (collective name)

Use **PowerShell** to describe the scripting language and an interactive shell.

### PowerShell (product name)

The cross-platform version of PowerShell that's built on .NET (core), rather than the .NET
Framework. PowerShell can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### PowerShell Core (product deprecated)

The name used for PowerShell v6, built on .NET Core. This name shouldn't be used.

### Windows PowerShell (product name)

The version of PowerShell that ships in Windows, which requires the full .NET Framework.

Guidelines

- First mention - use "Windows PowerShell"
- Subsequent mentions - Use "PowerShell" unless the use case requires "Windows PowerShell" to be
  more specific:

  > In PowerShell, the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet returns **BasicHtmlWebResponseObject**

  > In Windows PowerShell, the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet returns **HtmlWebResponseObject**

## PowerShell modules

PowerShell modules are add-ons that containing PowerShell cmdlets that manage specific products or
services.

For example:

- Azure PowerShell
- Az.Accounts module

Guidelines

  module
