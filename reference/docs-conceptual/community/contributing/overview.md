# Contributing to PowerShell documentation

Thank you for your support of PowerShell!

The Contributor's Guide is a collection of articles that explain the tools and processes we use to
create documentation at Microsoft. Some of these guides cover information that is common to any
documentation set published to [docs.microsoft.com][docs]. Some of the guides are specific to how we
write documentation for PowerShell.

The common articles are available in our centralized [Contributor's Guide][contribute]. The
PowerShell-specific guides are available here.

## Ways to contribute

There are two ways to contribute. Both contributions are valuable to us.

- [Filing issues][file-an-issue] helps us identify problems and gaps in our documentation. Sometimes
  the issues are difficult to resolve, requiring more investigation and research. The issue process
  allows us to have a conversation about the problem and develop a satisfactory resolution.

- Submitting new content or changes to existing articles is a more involved process. The following
  information outlines the tools, processes, and standards for submitting content to the
  documentation.

## Prepare to make a contribution

Contributing to the documentation requires a GitHub account. Use the following checklist to get the
tools and understand the processes we use for making contributions.

1. [Sign up for GitHub](/contribute/get-started-setup-github)
1. [Install Git and Markdown tools](/contribute/get-started-setup-tools)
1. [Install the Docs Authoring Pack](/contribute/how-to-write-docs-auth-pack)
1. [Install Posh-Git][posh-git] - not required but recommended
1. [Set up a local Git repository](/contribute/get-started-setup-local)
1. [Review Git and GitHub fundamentals](/contribute/git-github-fundamentals)

## Get started writing docs

There are two ways to contribute changes to the documentation:

1. [Quick edits to existing docs](/contribute/#quick-edits-to-existing-documents)
   - Minor corrections, fixing typos, or small additions
1. [Full GitHub workflow for docs](/contribute/how-to-write-workflows-major)
   - large changes, multiple versions, adding or changing images, or contributing new articles

Also, read the [Writing essentials](/contribute/style-quick-start) section of the centralized
Contributor's Guide. Another excellent resource is the
[Microsoft Writing Style Guide][style-guide]. The goal of the Microsoft Writing Style Guide is to
help editors, technical writers, developers, marketers, and anyone else in IT write better content.

Minor corrections or clarifications to documentation and code examples in public repositories are
covered by the docs.microsoft.com [Terms of Use][terms-of-use].

Use the full GitHub workflow when you're making significant changes. If you're not an employee of
Microsoft, significant changes generate a comment in the pull request that asks you to submit an
online [Contribution Licensing Agreement (CLA)][cla]. We need you to complete the online form before
we can review or accept your pull request.

## Code of conduct

All repositories that publish to docs.microsoft.com have adopted the
[Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/) or the
[.NET Foundation Code of Conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct). For more
information, see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/).

## Next steps

The following articles cover information specific to PowerShell documentation. Where there's overlap
with the guidance in the centralized Contributor's Guide, we call out how those rules differ for the
PowerShell content.

Review the following documents:

- [How to file an issue](file-an-issue.md)
- [Get started writing docs](get-started-writing.md)
- [Submitting a pull request](pull-requests.md)
- [PowerShell-Docs style guide](powershell-style-guide.md)
- [Editing cmdlet reference](editing-cmdlet-ref.md)
