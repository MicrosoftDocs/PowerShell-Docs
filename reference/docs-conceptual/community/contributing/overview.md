# Contributing to PowerShell documentation

Thank you for your support of PowerShell!

The Contributor's Guide is a collection of articles that describe the tools and processes we use to
create documentation at Microsoft. Some of these guides cover information common to any
documentation set published to `learn.microsoft.com`. Other guides are specific to how we write
documentation for PowerShell.

The common articles are available in our centralized [Contributor's Guide][1]. The
PowerShell-specific guides are available here.

## Ways to contribute

There are two ways to contribute. Both contributions are valuable to us.

- [Filing issues][2] helps us identify problems and gaps in our documentation. Sometimes the issues
  are difficult to resolve, requiring more investigation and research. The issue process allows us
  to have a conversation about the problem and develop a satisfactory resolution.

- [Submitting a pull request][3] to add or change content is a more involved process. The following
  information outlines the tools, processes, and standards for submitting content to the
  documentation.

## Prepare to make a contribution

Contributing to the documentation requires a GitHub account. Use the following checklist to install
and configure the tools you need to make contributions.

1. [Sign up for GitHub][4]
1. [Install Git and Markdown tools][5]
1. [Install the Docs Authoring Pack][6]
1. [Install Posh-Git][7] - not required but recommended
1. [Set up a local Git repository][8]
1. [Review Git and GitHub fundamentals][9]

## Get started writing docs

There are two ways to contribute changes to the documentation:

1. [Quick edits to existing docs][10] - Minor corrections, fixing typos, or small additions
1. [Full GitHub workflow for docs][11] - large changes, multiple versions, adding or changing
   images, or contributing new articles

Also, read the [Writing essentials][12] section of the centralized Contributor's Guide. Another
excellent resource is the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide][13].

Minor corrections or clarifications to documentation and code examples in public repositories are
covered by the [learn.microsoft.com Terms of Use][14].

Use the full GitHub workflow when you're making significant changes. If you're not an employee of
Microsoft, our PR validation system adds a comment to the pull request asking you to sign the online
[Contribution Licensing Agreement (CLA)][15]. You must complete this step before we can review or
accept your pull request. Signing the CLA is only required the first time you submit a PR in the
repository. You will be asked to sign the CLA for each time you contribute to a new repository.

## Code of conduct

All repositories that publish to Microsoft Learn have adopted the
[Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct][16] or the
[.NET Foundation Code of Conduct][17]. For more
information, see the [Code of Conduct FAQ][18].

## Next steps

The following articles cover information specific to PowerShell documentation. Where there's overlap
with the guidance in the centralized Contributor's Guide, we call out how those rules differ for the
PowerShell content.

Review the following documents:

- [Get started writing docs][19]
- [Markdown best practices][21]
- [PowerShell-Docs style guide][22]
- [How to file an issue][2]
- [Submitting a pull request][20]
