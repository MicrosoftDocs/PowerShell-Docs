# Contributing to PowerShell documentation

Thank you for your support of PowerShell!

This document covers the process for contributing to the articles and code samples that are hosted
on the PowerShell documentation site. Contributions may be as simple as typo corrections or as
complex as new articles.

Issues for all this content are tracked on GitHub in the [PowerShell-Docs][docsrepo] repository.

## Documentation structure

The PowerShell-Docs repository is divided into two groups of content that are published to
[Microsoft Docs][psdocs].

- [/reference/][ref] - contains the PowerShell cmdlet reference for the cmdlets that ship in
  PowerShell. The reference is collected in versions folders (5.1, 6, 7.0, and 7.1). This
  content contains cmdlet reference only for the modules that ship with PowerShell.
- [/reference/docs-conceptual][conceptual] - contains the PowerShell conceptual documentation. This
  include setup instructions, sample scripts, how-to topics, and more.

## Contributor's guide

The Contributor's Guide is a collection of guides that explain the tools and processes we use to
create documentation at Microsoft. Some of these guides cover information that is common to any
documentation set published to [docs.microsoft.com][docs]. Some of the guides are specific to how we
write documentation for PowerShell.

The common articles are available in our centralized [Contributor's Guide][contribute]. The
PowerShell-specific guides are available here.

### Ways to contribute

There are two ways to contribute: filing issues and writing or updating documentation. Both are
valuable to us.

[Filing issues][file-an-issue] helps us identify problems and gaps in our documentation. Sometimes
the issues are difficult to resolve, requiring more investigation and research. The issue process
allows us to have a conversation about the problem and develop a satisfactory resolution.

Submitting new content or changes to existing articles is a more involved process. The following
information outlines the tools, processes, and standards for submitting content to the
documentation.
