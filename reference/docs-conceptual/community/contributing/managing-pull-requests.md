# Managing pull requests

This article documents how we manage pull requests in the PowerShell-Docs repository. This article
is designed to be a job aid for members of the PowerShell-Docs team. It's published here to provide
process transparency for our public contributors.

## Best practices

- The person submitting the PR shouldn't merge the PR without a peer review.
- Assign the peer reviewer when the PR is submitted. Early assignment allows the reviewer to respond
  sooner with editorial remarks.
- Use comments to describe the nature of the change or the type of review being requested. Be sure
  to @mention the reviewer. For example, if the change is minor and you don't need a full technical
  review, explain this in a comment.

## PR Process steps

1. Writer: Create PR
   - Link any issues resolved by the PR
   - Use GitHub's [autoclose](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords)
     feature to close the issue
1. Writer: Assign peer reviewer
1. Reviewer: proofreads and comments (as necessary)
1. Writer: Incorporate review feedback
1. Both: Review preview rendering
1. Both: Review validation report - fix warnings and errors
1. Writer: Add sign-off comment (include Acrolinx info)
1. Reviewer: Mark review "Approved"
1. Repo Admin: Merge PR (see below for criteria)

## Content Reviewer Checklist

See the [editorial checklist](editorial-checklist.md) for a more comprehensive list.

- Proofread for grammar, style, concision, technical accuracy
- Ensure examples still apply for the target version
- Check Preview rendering
- Check metadata - ms.date, remove ms.assetid, ensure required fields
- Validate markdown correctness
  - See style guide for content-specific formatting rules
- Reorganize examples as follows:
  - Intro sentence(s)
  - Code and output
  - Detailed explanation of code (as necessary)
- Check hyperlinks for accuracy
  - Replace or remove TechNet/MSDN links
  - Ensure minimum number of redirects to target
  - Ensure HTTPS
  - Correct link type
    - File links for local files
    - URL links for files outside of the docset
  - Remove locales from URLs
  - Simplify URLs pointing to `docs.microsoft.com`

## Branch Merge Process

The `staging` branch is the only branch that is merged into `live`. Merges from short-lived
(working) branches should be squashed.

| *Merge from/to*  | *release-branch* | *staging*        | *live*      |
| ---------------- |:----------------:|:----------------:|:-----------:|
| *working-branch* | squash and merge | squash and merge | Not allowed |
| *release-branch* | &mdash;          | merge            | Not allowed |
| *staging*        | rebase           | &mdash;          | merge       |

### PR Merger checklist

- Content review complete
- Correct target branch for the change
- No merge conflicts
- All validation and build step pass
  - Warnings and suggestions should be fixed (see [Notes](#notes) for exceptions)
  - No broken links
- Merge according to table

### Notes

The following warnings can be ignored:

```
Can't find service name for `<version>/<modulepath>/About/About.md`
```

```
Metadata with following name(s) are not allowed to be set in Yaml header, or as file level
metadata in docfx.json, or as global metadata in docfx.json: `locale`. They are generated by
Docs platform, so the values set in these 3 places will be ignored. Please remove them from all
3 places to resolve the warning.
```

When a PR is merged, the HEAD of the target branch is changed. Any open PRs that were based on the
previous HEAD are now outdated. The outdated PR can be merged using Admin rights to override the
merge warnings in GitHub. This is safe to do if the previously merged PR(s) have not touched the
same files. However, clicking the **Update Branch** button is the safest option. You may have
unresolved conflicts that need to be fixed.

## Publishing to Live

Periodically, the changes accumulated in the `staging` branch need to be published to the live
website.

- The `staging` branch is merged to `live` each weekday at 3pm PST.
- The `staging` branch should be merged to `live` after any significant change.
  - Changes to 50 or more files
  - After merging a release branch
  - Changes to repo or docset configurations (docfx.json, OPS configs, build scripts, etc.)
  - Changes to the redirection file
  - Changes to the TOC
  - After merging a "project" branch (content reorg, bulk update, etc.)
