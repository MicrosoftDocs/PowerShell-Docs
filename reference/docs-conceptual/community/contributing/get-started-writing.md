# Get started contributing to PowerShell documentation

This article is an overview of how to get started as a contributor to the PowerShell documentation.

## PowerShell-Docs structure

The [PowerShell-Docs repository][psdocs] is divided into two groups of content: reference and
conceptual.

### Reference content

The reference content is the PowerShell cmdlet reference for the cmdlets that ship in PowerShell.
The [reference][ref] is collected in versions folders (5.1, 7.0, 7.1, and 7.2). This content
contains cmdlet reference only for the modules that ship with PowerShell. This content is also used
to create the help information displayed by the `Get-Help` cmdlet.

### Conceptual content

The conceptual documentation includes the following content:

- Release notes
- Setup instructions
- Sample scripts and how-to articles
- DSC documentation
- SDK documentation

The [conceptual documentation][conceptual] is not organized by version. All articles are displayed
for every version of PowerShell. We're working to create version-specific articles. When that
feature is available in our documentation, this guide will be update with the appropriate
information.

> [!NOTE]
> Anytime a conceptual article is added, removed, or renamed, the TOC must be updated and included
> in the pull request.

## Creating new articles

A GitHub issue must be created for any new document you want to contribute. Check for existing
issues to make sure you're not duplicating efforts. Assigned issues are considered to be
`in progress`. If you wish to collaborate on an issue, contact the person assigned to the issue.

Similar to the PowerShell [RFC process][rfc], create an issue before you write the content. The
issue ensures you don't waste time and effort on work that gets rejected by the PowerShell-Docs
team. The issue allows us to consult with you on the scope of the content and where it fits in the
PowerShell documentation. All articles must be included in the Table of Contents (TOC). The proposed
TOC location should be included in the issue discussion.

> [!NOTE]
> The TOC for reference content is autogenerated by the publishing system. You
> don't have to update the TOC.

## Updating existing articles

Where applicable, cmdlet reference articles are duplicated across all versions of PowerShell
maintained in this repository. When reporting an issue about a cmdlet reference or an `About_`
article, you must specify which versions are affected by the issue. The issue template in GitHub
includes a checklist of versions. Use the checkboxes to specify which versions of the content are
affected.

Check all version of the article to see if the same change is needed in the other versions. Apply
the appropriate change to each version of the file.

## Localized content

The PowerShell documentation is written in English and translated into 17 other languages. The
English content is stored in the GitHub repository named `MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs`. The
localized content is stored in a separate repository for each language. The repositories use the
same basename but add the locale name to the end. For example, `MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs.de-de`
contains the content that was translated to German.

In general, issues and changes should be submitted to the English repository. All translations start
from the English content first. We use both human and machine translation.

| Translation method  |                              Languages                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Human translation   | de-DE, es-ES, fr-FR, it-IT, ja-JP, ko-KR, pt-BR, ru-RU, zh-CN, zh-TW |
| Machine translation | cs-CZ, hu-HU, nl-NL, pl-PL, pt-PT, sv-SE, tr-TR                      |

The content translated by machine translation may not always result in correct word choices and
grammar. If you find an error in translation for any language, rather than in the technical details
of the article, open an issue in the localized repository. Explain why you think the translation is
incorrect. Our localization team reviews and responds to these issues.

## Next steps

There are two common ways of submitting changes in GitHub. Both methods are described in the central
Contributor's Guide:

1. You can make [quick edits to existing documents](/contribute/#quick-edits-to-existing-documents)
   in the GitHub web interface.
1. Use the [full GitHub workflow][making-changes] for adding new articles, updating multiple files,
   or other large changes.

Before starting any changes, you should create a fork of the PowerShell-Docs repository. The changes
should be made in a working branch in you copy of the PowerShell-Docs. If you're using the **quick
edit** method in GitHub, these steps are handled for you. If you're using the **full GitHub
workflow**, you must be set up to [work locally][fork].

Both methods end with the creation of a Pull Request (PR). See
[Submitting a pull request](pull-requests.md) for more information and best practices.
