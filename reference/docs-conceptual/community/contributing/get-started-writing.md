# Get started contributing to PowerShell documentation

This article is an overview of how to get started as a contributor to the PowerShell documentation.

## PowerShell-Docs structure

The [PowerShell-Docs repository][psdocs] is divided into two groups of content. Git branches are
used to manage how and when documentation gets published.

### Reference content

The reference content is the PowerShell cmdlet reference for the cmdlets that ship in PowerShell.
The [reference][ref] is collected in versions folders (5.1, 6, 7.0, and 7.1). This content contains
cmdlet reference only for the modules that ship with PowerShell. This content is also used to create
the help information displayed by the `Get-Help` cmdlet.

> [!NOTE]
> The Table of Contents (TOC) for reference content is autogenerated by the publishing system. You
> don't have to update the TOC.

### Conceptual content

The conceptual documentation includes the following content:

- Release notes
- Setup instructions
- Sample scripts and how-to articles
- DSC documentation
- SDK documentation

The [conceptual documentation][conceptual] is not organized by version. All articles are displayed
for every version of PowerShell. We are working to create version-specific articles. When that
feature is available in our documentation, this guide will be update with the appropriate
information.

> [!NOTE]
> Anytime a conceptual article is added, removed, or renamed, the TOC must be updated and included
> in the pull request.

## Using git branches

The default branch for PowerShell-Docs is the `staging` branch. Changes made in working branches are
merged into the `staging` branch before then being published. About once a week, the `staging`
branch is merged into the `live` branch. The `live` branch contains the content that is published to
docs.microsoft.com. Changes should never be made directly in the `live` branch.

If you are submitting a change to documentation that only applies to an unreleased version of
PowerShell, check to see if there is a release branch for that version. All changes that apply to
a specific, future version should be targeted at the release branch. Release branches have the
following name pattern: `release-<version>`.

Before starting any changes, create a working branch in your local copy of the PowerShell-Docs
repository. This should be a [clone of your fork][fork]. Be sure to synchronize your local
repository before creating your working branch. The working branch should be created from an
update-to-date copy of the `staging` or `release` branch.

Make the changes you want to submit following the process in the
[Making your change][making-changes] section of the central Contributor's Guide.

### Creating new articles

A GitHub issue must be created for any new document you want to contribute. Check for existing
issues to make sure you're not duplicating efforts. Issues that are assigned to someone are
considered to be "in progress". If you wish to collaborate on an issue, contact the person assigned
to the issue.

Similar to the PowerShell [RFC process][rfc], creating an issue before writing the content ensures
that you don't spend a lot of time and effort on something that gets rejected by the PowerShell-Docs
team. This also allows us to consult with you on the scope of the content and where it should fit
within the PowerShell documentation.

### Updating existing articles

Where applicable, cmdlet reference article are duplicated across all versions of PowerShell. When
reporting an issue about a cmdlet reference or an `About_` article, you must specify which versions
are affected by the issue. The issue template in GitHub includes a checklist of versions. Use the
checkboxes to specify which versions of the content are affected. When you submit a change to a
article for an issue that affects multiple versions of the content, you must apply the appropriate
change to each version of the file.
