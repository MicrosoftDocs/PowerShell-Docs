# How to submit pull requests

To make changes to content, submit a pull request (PR) from your fork. A pull request must be
reviewed before it can merged. For best results, review the
[editorial checklist](editorial-checklist.md) before submitting your pull request.

## Target the correct branch

All pull requests should target the `staging` branch. Changes should never be submitted to the
`live` branch. Changes made in the `staging` branch get merged into `live`, overwriting any changes
made to `live`.

If you are submitting a change that only applies to an unreleased version of PowerShell, check for a
release branch for that version. Your PR should be targeted at the release branch. Release branches
have the following name pattern: `release-<version>`.

## Make the pull request process work better for everyone

The simpler and more focused you can make your PR, the faster it can be reviewed and merged.

### Avoid branches that update large numbers of files or contain unrelated changes

Avoid creating PRs that contain unrelated changes. Separate minor updates to existing articles from
new articles or major rewrites. Work on these changes in separate working branches.

Bulk changes create PRs with large numbers of changed files. Limit your PRs to a maximum of 50
changed files. Large PRs are difficult to review and are more prone to contain errors.

### Renaming or deleting files

If you are renaming or deleting files, there must be an issue associated with the PR. That issue
must discuss the need to rename or delete the files.

Avoid mixing content additions or change with file renames and deletes. Any file that is renamed or
deleted must be added to the master redirection file. When possible, you should also update any
files that link to the renamed or deleted content. This includes any TOC files.

## Docs PR validation service

The Docs PR validation service is a GitHub app that runs validation rules on the files in a PR. You
must fix any errors or warnings (see exceptions) reported by the validation service.

The following warnings can be ignored:

```
Can't find service name for `<version>/<modulepath>/About/About.md`
```

```
Metadata with following name(s) are not allowed to be set in Yaml header, or as file level
metadata in docfx.json, or as global metadata in docfx.json: `locale`. They are generated by
Docs platform, so the values set in these 3 places will be ignored. Please remove them from all
3 places to resolve the warning.
```

You'll see the following behavior:

1. You submit a PR.
1. In the GitHub comment that indicates the status of your PR, you'll see the status of "checks"
   enabled on the repository. Note that in this example, there are two checks enabled, "Commit Validation"
   and "OpenPublishing.Build":

   ![validation status - some checks failed](media/pull-requests/validation-failed.png)

   The build can pass even if commit validation fails.

1. Click **Details** for more information.
1. On the Details page, you'll see all the validation checks that failed, with information about how
   to fix the issues.
1. When validation succeeds, the following comment is added to the PR:

   ![Validation status: success](media/pull-requests/build-validation.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you are an external (not a Microsoft employee) contributor you do not have access to the
> detailed build reports or preview links.

When the PR is reviewed by a member of the PowerShell-Docs team, you may be asked to make changes or
fix problems flagged by the validation report. The PowerShell-Docs team can help you understand how
to fix and avoid these problems for future submissions.
