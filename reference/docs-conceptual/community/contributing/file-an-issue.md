# How to file a PowerShell-Docs issue

There are two ways to create an issue:

1. Use the feedback controls at the bottom of the page.
1. File an issue in GitHub directly

## Using the feedback controls

For a full description of the feedback controls, see the Docs Team blog announcing this
[feature][feedback].

At the bottom of most pages on `docs.microsoft.com`, you'll see two feedback buttons. One is a link
for product feedback and one is for documentation feedback. The documentation feedback requires a
GitHub account. Clicking the button takes you in GitHub and presents a prepopulated issue template.
Enter your feedback and submit the form.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not a support channel. This is a way to ask clarifying questions about documentation or
> to report errors and omissions. If you need technical support, see
> [Community resources](../community-support.md).

## Filing issues on GitHub

To file a GitHub issue directly, you can click on the [New issue][new-issue] button in the
[PowerShell-Docs][docs-issues] repository. Click the **Get started** button for the type of issue
you want to create. The new GitHub issue is prepopulated with a template. The template helps you
provide the information needed to address the problem you're reporting.

Before you file a new issue, read through existing issues to see if your problem has already been
reported. This helps avoid duplication and your issue may have been answered already. If you find an
existing issue, you can add your comments, related questions, or answers.
