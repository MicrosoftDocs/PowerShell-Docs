# How to file a PowerShell-Docs issue

There are two ways to create an issue:

1. Use the feedback controls at the bottom of the page.
1. File an issue in GitHub directly

## Using the feedback controls

For a full description of the feedback controls, see the Docs Team blog announcing this
[feature][1].

At the bottom of most pages on `learn.microsoft.com`, there are two feedback buttons. One is a link
for product feedback and one is for documentation feedback. The documentation feedback requires a
GitHub account. Clicking the button takes you in GitHub and presents an issue template. Enter your
feedback and submit the form.

> [!NOTE]
> The feedback tool not a support channel. It's a way to ask questions to clarify documentation or
> to report errors and omissions. If you need technical support, see [Community resources][2].

## Filing issues on GitHub

To file a GitHub issue directly, you can select the [New issue][3] button in the PowerShell-Docs
repository. Select the **Get started** button for the issue you want to create. The GitHub issue
template helps you provide the information needed to address the problem you're reporting.

To avoid duplication, search the existing issues to see if someone else has already reported it. If
you find an existing issue, you can add your comments, related questions, or answers.

## Next steps
