## 2025-July

New content

- [The Monad Manifesto](../developer/monad-manifesto.md) - No new but certainly a classic.

Content updates

- In July, we completed the deployment of a new build pipeline for PowerShell reference content. Now
  all reference content for Microsoft products and services is using the new build system. The
  webpage has a new right-hand navigation menu and we greatly improved the documentation of
  parameters by including full details about each parameter set.
