# Runspace03 Sample

This sample shows how to use the [System.Management.Automation.Powershell](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.powershell) class to run a script synchronously, and how to handle non-terminating errors. The script receives a list of process names and then retrieves those processes. The results of the script, including any non-terminating errors that were generated when running the script, are displayed in a console window.

## Requirements

This sample requires Windows PowerShell 2.0.

## Demonstrates

This sample demonstrates the following.

- Creating a [System.Management.Automation.Powershell](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.powershell) object to run a script.

- Adding a script to the pipeline of the [System.Management.Automation.Powershell](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.powershell) object.

- Passing input objects to the script from the calling program.

- Running the script synchronously.

- Using [System.Management.Automation.PSObject](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.PSObject) objects to extract and display properties from the objects returned by the script.

- Retrieving and displaying error records that were generated when the script was run.

## Example

This sample runs a script synchronously in the default runspace provided by Windows PowerShell. The output of the script and any non-terminating errors that were generated are displayed in a console window.

        //  the script.
        Console.WriteLine("\nThe following non-terminating errors occurred:\n");
        PSDataCollection<ErrorRecord> errors = powershell.Streams.Error;

          foreach (ErrorRecord err in errors)
