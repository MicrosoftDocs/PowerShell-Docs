# Runspace09 Sample

This sample shows how to add a script to the pipeline of a [System.Management.Automation.Powershell](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.powershell) object and how to run the script asynchronously. Events are used to handle the output of the script.

## Requirements

This sample requires Windows PowerShell 2.0.

## Demonstrates

This sample demonstrates the following.

- Creating a [System.Management.Automation.Powershell](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.powershell) object that uses the runspace.

- Adding a script the pipeline of the [System.Management.Automation.Powershell](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.powershell) object.

- Using the [System.Management.Automation.Powershell.Begininvoke*](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.PowerShell.BeginInvoke) method to run the pipeline asynchronously.

- Using the events of the [System.Management.Automation.Powershell](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.powershell) object to process the output of the script.

- Using the [System.Management.Automation.Powershell.Stop*](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.PowerShell.Stop) method to interrupt the invocation of the pipeline.

## Example

This sample runs to run a script that generates the numbers from 1 to 10 with delays between each number. The script is run asynchronously and events are used to handle the output.

```csharp
namespace Microsoft.Samples.PowerShell.Runspaces
{
  using System;
  using System.Collections.Generic;
  using System.Collections.ObjectModel;
  using System.Diagnostics;
  using System.Management.Automation;
  using System.Management.Automation.Runspaces;
  using PowerShell = System.Management.Automation.PowerShell;
