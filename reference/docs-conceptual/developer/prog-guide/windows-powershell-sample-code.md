# Windows PowerShell Sample Code

Windows PowerShell® samples are available through the Windows SDK. This section contains the sample
code that is contained in the Windows SDK samples.

> [!NOTE]
> When the Windows SDK is installed, a **Samples** directory is created in which all the Windows
> PowerShell samples are made available. A typical installation directory is **C:\Program
> Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0**. Start Windows PowerShell and type **"cd
> Samples\SysMgmt\PowerShell"** to locate the Windows PowerShell Samples directory. In this
> document, the Windows PowerShell Samples directory is referred to as **\<PowerShell Samples>**.
