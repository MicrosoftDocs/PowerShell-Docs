# Runspace02 Code Samples

Here is the source code for the Runspace02 sample. This sample uses the [System.Management.Automation.Runspaceinvoke](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.RunspaceInvoke) class to execute the `Get-Process` cmdlet synchronously. Windows Forms and data binding are then used to display the results in a DataGridView control.

For complete sample code, see the following topics.
