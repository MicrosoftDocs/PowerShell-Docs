# AccessDbProviderSample02 Code Sample

The following code shows the implementation of the Windows PowerShell provider described in
[Creating a Windows PowerShell Drive Provider](./creating-a-windows-powershell-drive-provider.md).
This implementation creates a path, makes a connection to an Access database, and then removes the
drive.

> [!NOTE]
> You can download the C# source file (AccessDBSampleProvider02.cs) for this provider using the
> Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit for Windows Vista and Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0
> Runtime Components. For download instructions, see
