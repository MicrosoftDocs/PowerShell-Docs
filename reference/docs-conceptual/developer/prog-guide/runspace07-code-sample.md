# RunSpace07 Code Sample

Here is the source code for the Runspace07 sample described in
[Creating a Console Application That Adds Commands to a Pipeline](https://msdn.microsoft.com/01eb7808-e97b-4905-80be-9e2fa38c262e).
This sample application creates a runspace, creates a pipeline, adds two commands to the pipeline,
and then executes the pipeline. The commands added to the pipeline are the `Get-Process` and
`Measure-Object` cmdlets.
