# StopProc01 Code Samples

Here is the code sample for the StopProc01 sample cmdlet. This is the `Stop-Process` cmdlet sample described in [Creating a Cmdlet that Modifies the System](../cmdlet/creating-a-cmdlet-that-modifies-the-system.md). The `Stop-Process` cmdlet is designed to stop processes that are retrieved using the Get-Proc cmdlet (described in [Creating Your First Cmdlet](../cmdlet/creating-a-cmdlet-without-parameters.md)).

> [!NOTE]
> You can download the C# (stopproc01.cs) source file for the Stop-Proc cmdlet using the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit for Windows Vista and .NET Framework 3.0 Runtime Components. For download instructions, see [How to Install Windows PowerShell and Download the Windows PowerShell SDK](/powershell/scripting/developer/installing-the-windows-powershell-sdk).
