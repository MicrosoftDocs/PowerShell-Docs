# StopProcessSample04 (VB.NET) Sample Code

Here is the complete VB.NET sample code for the StopProc04 sample cmdlet. This is the code for the `Stop-Process` cmdlet described in [Adding Parameter Sets to a Cmdlet](../cmdlet/adding-parameter-sets-to-a-cmdlet.md). The `Stop-Process` cmdlet is designed to stop processes that are retrieved using the Get-Proc cmdlet (described in [Creating Your First Cmdlet](../cmdlet/creating-a-cmdlet-without-parameters.md)).

> [!NOTE]
> You can download the VB.NET (stopprocesssample04.vb) source file for this Stop-Proc cmdlet using the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit for Windows Vista and .NET Framework 3.0 Runtime Components. For download instructions, see [How to Install Windows PowerShell and Download the Windows PowerShell SDK](/powershell/scripting/developer/installing-the-windows-powershell-sdk).
