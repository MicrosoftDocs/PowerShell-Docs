# StopProcessSample04 (C#) Sample Code

Here is the complete C# sample code for the StopProc04 sample cmdlet. This is the code for the
`Stop-Process` cmdlet described in
[Adding Parameter Sets to a Cmdlet](../cmdlet/adding-parameter-sets-to-a-cmdlet.md). The
`Stop-Process` cmdlet is designed to stop processes that are retrieved using the Get-Proc cmdlet
(described in [Creating Your First Cmdlet](../cmdlet/creating-a-cmdlet-without-parameters.md)).
