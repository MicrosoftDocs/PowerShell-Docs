# RunSpace04  (VB.NET) Code Sample

Here is the VB.NET source code for the Runspace04 sample. This sample uses the [System.Management.Automation.Runspaceinvoke](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.RunspaceInvoke) class to execute a script that generates a terminating error. The host application is responsible for catching the error and interpreting the error record.

> [!NOTE]
> You can download the VB.NET source file (runspace02.vb) for this sample by using the Windows Software Development Kit for Windows Vista and Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 Runtime Components. For download instructions, see [How to Install Windows PowerShell and Download the Windows PowerShell SDK](/powershell/scripting/developer/installing-the-windows-powershell-sdk).
>
> The downloaded source files are available in the **\<PowerShell Samples>** directory.

## Code Sample

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Collections
Imports System.Collections.Generic
Imports System.Collections.ObjectModel
Imports System.Text
Imports Microsoft.VisualBasic
Imports System.Management.Automation
Imports System.Management.Automation.Host
Imports System.Management.Automation.Runspaces

Namespace Microsoft.Samples.PowerShell.Runspaces

    Class Runspace04

        ''' <summary>
        ''' This sample uses the RunspaceInvoke class to execute
        ''' a script. This script will generate a terminating
        ''' exception that the caller should catch and process.
        ''' </summary>
        ''' <param name="args">Unused</param>
        ''' <remarks>
        ''' This sample demonstrates the following:
        ''' 1. Creating an instance of the RunspaceInvoke class.
        ''' 2. Using this instance to execute a string as a PowerShell script.
        ''' 3. Passing input objects to the script from the calling program.
        ''' 4. Using PSObject to extract and display properties from the objects
        '''    returned by this command.
        ''' 5. Retrieving and displaying error records that may be generated
        '''    during the execution of that script.
        ''' 6. Catching and displaying terminating exceptions generated
        '''    by the script being run.
        ''' </remarks>
