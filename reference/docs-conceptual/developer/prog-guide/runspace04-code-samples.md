# RunSpace04 Code Samples

Here is a code sample for a runspace that uses the [System.Management.Automation.Runspaceinvoke](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.RunspaceInvoke) class to execute a script that generates a terminating error. The host application is responsible for catching the error and interpreting the error record.

> [!NOTE]
> You can download the VB.NET source file (Runspace04.vb) for this runspace using the Windows Software Development Kit for Windows Vista and Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 Runtime Components. For download instructions, see [How to Install Windows PowerShell and Download the Windows PowerShell SDK](/powershell/scripting/developer/installing-the-windows-powershell-sdk).
>
> The downloaded source files are available in the **\<PowerShell Samples>** directory.
