# RunSpace03 (VB.NET) Code Sample

Here is the VB.NET source code for the console application described in
"Creating a Console Application That Runs a Specified Script". This sample uses
the [System.Management.Automation.Runspaceinvoke](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.RunspaceInvoke)
class to execute a script that retrieves process information for the list of
process names passed into the script. It shows how to pass input objects to a
script and how to retrieve error objects as well as the output objects.

> [!NOTE]
> You can download the VB.NET source file (runspace03.vb) for this sample by
> using the Windows Software Development Kit for Windows Vista and Microsoft
> .NET Framework 3.0 Runtime Components. For download instructions, see
> [How to Install Windows PowerShell and Download the Windows PowerShell SDK](/powershell/scripting/developer/installing-the-windows-powershell-sdk).
> The downloaded source files are available in the **\<PowerShell Samples>**
> directory.

## Code Sample

Imports System
Imports System.Collections
Imports System.Collections.Generic
Imports System.Collections.ObjectModel
Imports System.Text
Imports Microsoft.VisualBasic
Imports System.Management.Automation
Imports System.Management.Automation.Host
Imports System.Management.Automation.Runspaces

        ''' <summary>
        ''' This sample uses the RunspaceInvoke class to execute
        ''' a script that retrieves process information for the
        ''' list of process names passed into the script.

        ''' <param name="args">Unused</param>
        ''' <remarks>
        ''' This sample demonstrates the following:
        ''' 1. Creating an instance of the RunspaceInvoke class.
        ''' 2. Using this instance to execute a string as a PowerShell script.
        ''' 3. Passing input objects to the script from the calling program.
        ''' 4. Using PSObject to extract and display properties from the objects
        '''    returned by this command.
        ''' 5. Retrieving and displaying error records that were generated
        '''    during the execution of that script.
        ''' </remarks>
