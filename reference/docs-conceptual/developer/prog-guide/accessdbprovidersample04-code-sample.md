# AccessDbProviderSample04 Code Sample

The following code shows the implementation of the Windows PowerShell provider described in [Creating a Windows PowerShell Container Provider](./creating-a-windows-powershell-container-provider.md). This provider works on multi-layer data stores. For this type of data store, the top level of the store contains the root items and each subsequent level is referred to as a node of child items. By allowing the user to work on these child nodes, a user can interact hierarchically through the data store.

## Code Sample
