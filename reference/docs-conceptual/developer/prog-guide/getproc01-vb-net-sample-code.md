# GetProc01 (VB.NET) Sample Code

The following code shows the implementation of the GetProc01 sample cmdlet. Notice that the cmdlet is simplified by leaving the actual work of process retrieval to the [System.Diagnostics.Process.Getprocesses*](/dotnet/api/System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcesses) method.

> [!NOTE]
> You can download the C# source file (getproc01.cs) for this Get-Proc cmdlet using the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit for Windows Vista and .NET Framework 3.0 Runtime Components. For download instructions, see [How to Install Windows PowerShell and Download the Windows PowerShell SDK](/powershell/scripting/developer/installing-the-windows-powershell-sdk).
>
> The downloaded source files are available in the **\<PowerShell Samples>** directory.
