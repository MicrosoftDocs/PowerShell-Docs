# GetProc04 Code Samples

Here are the code samples for the GetProc04 sample cmdlet. This is the `Get-Process` cmdlet sample described in [Adding Nonterminating Error Reporting to Your Cmdlet](../cmdlet/adding-non-terminating-error-reporting-to-your-cmdlet.md). This `Get-Process` cmdlet calls the [System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.WriteError](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.WriteError) method whenever an invalid operation exception is thrown while retrieving process information.

> [!NOTE]
> You can download the C# source file (getprov04.cs) for this Get-Proc cmdlet using the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit for Windows Vista and .NET Framework 3.0 Runtime Components. For download instructions, see [How to Install Windows PowerShell and Download the Windows PowerShell SDK](/powershell/scripting/developer/installing-the-windows-powershell-sdk).
>
