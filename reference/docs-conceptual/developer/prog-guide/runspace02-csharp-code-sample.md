# Runspace02 (C#) Code Sample

Here is the C# source code for the Runspace02 sample. This sample uses the
[System.Management.Automation.Runspaceinvoke](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.RunspaceInvoke)
class to execute the `Get-Process` cmdlet synchronously. Windows Forms and data binding are then
used to display the results in a DataGridView control

## Code Sample
