# RunSpace06 Code Sample

Here is the source code for the Runspace06 sample described in
[Configuring a Runspace Using a Windows PowerShell Snap-in](https://msdn.microsoft.com/a7289ee8-9732-49ee-91c7-d533e9538b83).
This sample application creates a runspace based on a Windows PowerShell snap-in, which is then used
to run a pipeline with a single command. To do this, the application creates the runspace
configuration information, creates a runspace, creates a pipeline with a single command, and then
executes the pipeline.
