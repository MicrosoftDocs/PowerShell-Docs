# Runspace01 (C#) Code Sample

Here are the code samples for the runspace described in [Creating a Console Application That Runs a Specified Command](/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/hello-world-your-first-program). To do this, the application invokes a runspace, and then invokes a command. (Note that this application does not specify runspace configuration information, nor does it explicitly create a pipeline). The command that is invoked is the `Get-Process` cmdlet.

> [!NOTE]
> You can download the C# source file (runspace01.cs) for this runspace using the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit for Windows Vista and Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 Runtime Components. For download instructions, see [How to Install Windows PowerShell and Download the Windows PowerShell SDK](/powershell/developer/installing-the-windows-powershell-sdk).
>
> The downloaded source files are available in the **\<PowerShell Samples>** directory.
