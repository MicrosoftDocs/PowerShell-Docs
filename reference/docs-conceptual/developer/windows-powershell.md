# Windows PowerShell

Updated: July 8, 2013

Windows PowerShell&reg; is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language designed especially
for system administration. Built on the .NET Framework, Windows PowerShell&reg; helps IT professionals
and power users control and automate the administration of the Windows operating system and
applications that run on Windows.

The documents published here are written primarily for cmdlet, provider, and host application
developers who require reference information about the APIs provided by Windows PowerShell.
However, system administrators might also find the information provided by these documents useful.

For the basic information needed to start using Windows PowerShell, see Getting Started with
Windows PowerShell .
