This section provides a tutorial for creating the Select-Str cmdlet, which is very similar to the [Select-String](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/select-string) cmdlet provided by Windows PowerShell. This tutorial provides fragments of code that illustrate how cmdlets are implemented, and an explanation of the code.
