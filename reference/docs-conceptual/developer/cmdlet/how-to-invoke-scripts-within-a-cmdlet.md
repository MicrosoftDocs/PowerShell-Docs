# How to Invoke Scripts Within a Cmdlet

This example shows how to invoke a script that is supplied to a cmdlet. The script is executed by the cmdlet, and its results are returned to the cmdlet as a collection of [System.Management.Automation.PSObject](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.PSObject) objects.

## To invoke a script block

1. The command verifies that a script block was supplied to the cmdlet. If a script block was supplied, the command invokes the script block with its required parameters.

    ```csharp
    if (script != null)
    {
      WriteDebug("Executing script block.");

      // Invoke the script block with the required arguments.
      Collection<PSObject> PSObjects =
                     script.Invoke(
                                   line,
                                   simpleMatch,
                                   caseSensitive
                                  );
    ```

2. Then, the script iterates through the returned collection of [System.Management.Automation.PSObject](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.PSObject) objects and perform the necessary operations.

    ```csharp
    foreach (PSObject psObject in psObjects)
    {
      if (LanguagePrimitives.IsTrue(psObject))
      {
        result = new MatchInfo();
        result.Line = line;
        result.IgnoreCase = !caseSensitive;

        break;
      }
    }

    ```
