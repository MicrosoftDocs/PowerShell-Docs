# Approved Verbs for PowerShell Commands

PowerShell uses a verb-noun pair for the names of cmdlets and for their derived .NET classes.
The verb part of the name identifies the action that the cmdlet performs. The noun part of
the name identifies the entity on which the action is performed. For example, the `Get-Command`
cmdlet retrieves all the commands that are registered in PowerShell.

> [!NOTE]
> PowerShell uses the term _verb_ to describe a word that implies an action even if that word is not
> a standard verb in the English language. For example, the term _New_ is a valid PowerShell verb
> name because it implies an action even though it is not a verb in the English language.

<!--
01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789
-->

Each approved verb has a corresponding _alias prefix_ defined.
We use this alias prefix in aliases for commands using that verb.
For example, the alias prefix for `Import` is `ip` and, accordingly,
the alias for `Import-Module` is `ipmo`.  This is a recommendation but not a rule;
in particular, it need not be respected for command aliases
mimicking well known commands from other environments.

## Verb Naming Recommendations

The following recommendations help you choose an appropriate verb for your cmdlet, to ensure
consistency between the cmdlets that you create, the cmdlets that are provided by PowerShell,
and the cmdlets that are designed by others.

- Use one of the predefined verb names provided by PowerShell
- Use the verb to describe the general scope of the action, and use parameters to further refine the action of the cmdlet.
- Do not use a synonym of an approved verb. For example, always use `Remove`, never use `Delete` or `Eliminate`.
- Use only the form of each verb that is listed in this topic. For example, use `Get`, but do not use `Getting` or `Gets`.
- Do not use the following reserved verbs or aliases. The PowerShell language or a rare few of its cmdlet uses these verbs under exceptional circumstances.
    - ForEach (foreach)
    - [Format](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.VerbsCommon.Format) (f): Arranges objects in a specified form or layout
    - [Group](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.VerbsData.Group) (gp): Arranges or associates one or more resources
    - [Ping](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.VerbsDiagnostic.Ping) (pi)
    - Sort (sr)
    - Tee (te)
    - Where (wh)

You may get a complete list of verbs using the `Get-Verb` cmdlet.

## Similar Verbs for Different Actions

The following similar verbs represent different actions.

### New vs. Set

Use the `New` verb to create a new resource. Use the `Set` verb to modify an existing
resource, optionally creating it if it does not exist, such as the `Set-Variable` cmdlet.

### Find vs. Search

Use the `Find` verb to look for an object. Use the `Search` verb to create a reference to a
resource in a container.

### Get vs. Read

Use the `Get` verb to obtain information about a resource (such as a file) or to obtain an object with which you can access the resource in future. Use the `Read` verb to open a resource and either extract information contained within.

### Invoke vs. Start

Use the `Invoke` verb to perform synchronous operations, such as
running a command and waiting for it to end. Use the `Start` verb is used to begin asynchronous
operations, such as starting an autonomous process.

### Ping vs. Test

Use the `Test` verb.

## Common Verbs
