# How to Add the Cmdlet Name and Synopsis to a Cmdlet Help Topic

This section describes how to add content that is displayed in the NAME and SYNOPSIS sections of the cmdlet help. In the Help file, this content is added to the Command node for each cmdlet.

> [!NOTE]
> For a complete view of a Help file, open one of the dll-Help.xml files located in the Windows PowerShell installation directory. For example, the Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management.dll-Help.xml file contains content for several of the Windows PowerShell cmdlets.

### To Add the Cmdlet Name and a Synopsis

- The cmdlet Help can display two descriptions for the cmdlet. The first description is a short description that is referred to as the synopsis. The second description is a more detailed description that is discussed in [Adding the Detailed Description to a Cmdlet Help Topic](./how-to-add-a-cmdlet-description.md). Both these descriptions should be written as a single paragraph.

- In the synopsis do not repeat the cmdlet name. Informing the user that the Get-Server cmdlet gets a server is brief, but not informative. Instead, use synonyms and add details to the description.

  Example: "Gets an object that represents a local or remote computer."

- Use simple verbs like "get", "create", and "change" in the synopsis. Avoid using "set" because it is vague, and fancy words such as "modify."

  Example: "Gets information about the Authenticode signature in a file."

- Write in active voice. For example, "Use the TimeSpan object..." is much clearer than "the TimeSpan object can be used to..."

- Avoid the verb "display" when describing cmdlets that get objects. Although Windows PowerShell displays cmdlet data, it is important to introduce users to the concept that the cmdlet returns .NET Framework objects whose data may not be displayed. If you emphasize the display, the user might not realize that the cmdlet may have returned many other useful properties and methods that are not displayed.
