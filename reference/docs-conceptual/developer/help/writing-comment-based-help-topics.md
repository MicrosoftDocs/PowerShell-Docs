# Writing Comment-Based Help Topics

You can write comment-based Help topics for functions and scripts by using special Help comment keywords.

 The `Get-Help` cmdlet displays comment-based Help in the same format in which it displays the
 cmdlet Help topics that are generated from XML files. Users can use all of the parameters of
 `Get-Help`, such as Detailed, Full, Example, and Online, to display function and script Help.

 You can also write XML-based Help topics for scripts and functions and use the Help comment
 keywords to redirect users to the XML-based topics or other topics.
