# Writing Comment-Based Help Topics

You can write comment-based Help topics for functions and scripts using special Help comment
keywords.

The `Get-Help` cmdlet displays comment-based Help in the same format in which it displays the cmdlet
Help topics that are generated from XML files. Users can use all of the parameters of `Get-Help`,
such as Detailed, Full, Example, and Online, to display function and script Help.

You can also write XML-based Help topics for scripts and functions and use the Help comment keywords
to redirect users to the XML-based topics or other topics.
