# Comment-Based Help Keywords

This topic lists and describes the keywords in comment-based help.

## Keywords in Comment-Based Help

The following are valid comment-based Help keywords. They're listed in the order in which they
typically appear in a Help topic along with their intended use. These keywords can appear in any
order in the comment-based Help, and they're not case-sensitive.

Note that the `.EXTERNALHELP` keyword takes precedence over all other comment-based help keywords.
When `.EXTERNALHELP` is present, the [Get-Help][02] cmdlet doesn't display comment-based help, even
when it can't find a help file that matches the value of the keyword.

## `.SYNOPSIS`

A brief description of the function or script. This keyword can be used only
once in each topic.

## `.DESCRIPTION`

A detailed description of the function or script. This keyword can be used only
once in each topic.

## `.PARAMETER <Parameter-Name>`

The description of a parameter. You can include a `.PARAMETER` keyword for each
parameter in the function or script.

The `.PARAMETER` keywords can appear in any order in the comment block, but the
order in which the parameters appear in the `param` statement or function
declaration determines the order in which the parameters appear in Help topic.
To change the order of parameters in the Help topic, change the order of the
parameters in the `param` statement or function declaration.

You can also specify a parameter description by placing a comment in the
`param` statement immediately before the parameter variable name. If you use
both a `param` statement comment and a `.PARAMETER` keyword, the description
associated with the `.PARAMETER` keyword is used, and the `param` statement
comment is ignored.

## `.EXAMPLE`

A sample command that uses the function or script, optionally followed by
sample output and a description. Repeat this keyword for each example.

## `.INPUTS`

The .NET types of objects that can be piped to the function or script. You can
also include a description of the input objects. Repeat this keyword for each
input type.

## `.OUTPUTS`

The .NET type of the objects that the cmdlet returns. You can also include a
description of the returned objects. Repeat this keyword for each output type.

## `.NOTES`

Additional information about the function or script.

## `.LINK`

The name of a related topic. Repeat this keyword for each related topic. This
content appears in the Related Links section of the Help topic.

The `.LINK` keyword content can also include a Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI) to an online version of the same help topic. The online version opens
when you use the **Online** parameter of `Get-Help`. The URI must begin with
`http` or `https`.

## `.COMPONENT`

The name of the technology or feature that the function or script uses, or to
which it's related. The **Component** parameter of `Get-Help` uses this value
to filter the search results returned by `Get-Help`.

## `.ROLE`

The name of the user role for the help topic. The **Role** parameter of
`Get-Help` uses this value to filter the search results returned by `Get-Help`.

## `.FUNCTIONALITY`

The keywords that describe the intended use of the function. The
**Functionality** parameter of `Get-Help` uses this value to filter the search
results returned by `Get-Help`.

## `.FORWARDHELPTARGETNAME <Command-Name>`

Redirects to the help topic for the specified command. You can redirect users
to any help topic, including help content for a function, script, cmdlet, or
provider.

```powershell
# .FORWARDHELPTARGETNAME <Command-Name>
```

## `.FORWARDHELPCATEGORY`

Specifies the help category of the item in `.FORWARDHELPTARGETNAME`. Valid
values are `Alias`, `Cmdlet`, `HelpFile`, `Function`, `Provider`, `General`,
`FAQ`, `Glossary`, `ScriptCommand`, `ExternalScript`, `Filter`, or `All`. Use
this keyword to avoid conflicts when there are commands with the same name.

```powershell
# .FORWARDHELPCATEGORY <Category>
```

## `.REMOTEHELPRUNSPACE <PSSession-variable>`

Specifies a session that contains the help topic. Enter a variable that
contains a **PSSession** object. This keyword is used by the
[Export-PSSession][09] cmdlet to find the help content for the exported
commands.

```powershell
# .REMOTEHELPRUNSPACE <PSSession-variable>
```

## `.EXTERNALHELP`

Specifies an XML-based help file for the script or function.

```powershell
# .EXTERNALHELP <XML Help File>
```

The `.EXTERNALHELP` keyword is required when a function or script is documented
in XML files. Without this keyword, `Get-Help` can't find the XML-based help
file for the function or script.

The `.EXTERNALHELP` keyword takes precedence over other comment-based help
keywords. If `.EXTERNALHELP` is present, `Get-Help` doesn't display
comment-based help, even if it can't find a help topic that matches the value
of the `.EXTERNALHELP` keyword.

If the function is exported by a module, set the value of the `.EXTERNALHELP`
keyword to a filename without a path. `Get-Help` looks for the specified file
name in a language-specific subdirectory of the module directory. There are no
requirements for the name of the XML-based help file for a function, but a best
practice is to use the following format:

```Syntax
<ScriptModule.psm1>-help.xml
```

If the function isn't included in a module, include a path to the XML-based
help file. If the value includes a path and the path contains
UI-culture-specific subdirectories, `Get-Help` searches the subdirectories
recursively for an XML file with the name of the script or function in
accordance with the language fallback standards established for Windows, just
as it does in a module directory.
