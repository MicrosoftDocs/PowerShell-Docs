# File Types Permitted in an Updatable Help CAB File

This topics lists and describes the content requirements for Updatable Help CAB files.

## Updatable Help CAB File Requirements

Uncompressed CAB file content is limited to 1 GB by default. To bypass this limit, users have to use the **Force** parameter of the [Update-Help](/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/Update-Help) and [Save-Help](/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/Save-Help) cmdlets.

To assure the security of help files that are downloaded from the Internet, an Updatable Help CAB file can include only the file types listed below. The [Update-Help](/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/Update-Help) cmdlet validates all files against the help topic schemas. If the `Update-Help` cmdlet encounters a file that is invalid or is not a permitted type, it does not install the invalid file and stops installing files from the CAB on the user's computer.

- XML-based help topics for cmdlets.

- XML-based help topics for scripts and functions.

- XML-based help topics for Windows PowerShell providers.

- Text-based help topics, such as About topics.

The [Update-Help](/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/Update-Help) verifies the CAB contents when it unpacks the CAB. If `Update-Help` finds non-compliant file types in an Updatable Help CAB file, it generates a terminating error and stops the operation. It does not install any help files from the CAB, even those of compliant file types.
