## Text Value

Specify the name of the selection set.

## Remarks

Selection sets are typically used when you want to define a group of objects that are used in multiple views. For example, you might want to create a table view and a list view for the same set of objects. For more information about defining selection sets, see [Defining Sets of objects for a View](./defining-selection-sets.md).

If you specify a selection set for an entry, you cannot specify a type name. For more information about how to specify a .NET type, see [TypeName Element for EntrySelectedBy for TableRowEntry (Format)](./typename-element-for-entryselectedby-for-tablecontrol-format.md).

For more information about the components of a table view, see [Creating a Table View](./creating-a-table-view.md).
