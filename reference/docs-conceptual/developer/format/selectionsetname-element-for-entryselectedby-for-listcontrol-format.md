|-------------|-----------------|
|[EntrySelectedBy Element for ListEntry (Format)](./entryselectedby-element-for-listentry-for-listcontrol-format.md)|Defines the .NET types that use this list entry or the condition that must exist for this entry to be used.|

## Text Value

Specify the name of the selection set.

## Remarks

Each list entry must have at least one type name, selection set, or selection condition defined.

Selection sets are typically used when you want to define a group of objects that are used in multiple views. For example, you might want to create a table view and a list view for the same set of objects. For more information about defining selection sets, see [Defining Sets of objects for a View](./defining-selection-sets.md).

For more information about the components of a list view, see [Creating a List View](./creating-a-list-view.md).

## Example

The following example shows how to specify a selection set for an entry of a list view.

```xml
<ListEntry>
  <EntrySelectedBy>
    <SelectionSetName>NameofSelectionSet</SelectionSetName>
  </EntrySelectedBy>
  <ListItems>...</ListItems>
</ListEntry>
```
