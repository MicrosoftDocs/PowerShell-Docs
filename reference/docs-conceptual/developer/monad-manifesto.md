# The Monad Manifesto

Jeffrey Snover, the inventor of PowerShell, wrote the Monad Manifesto to explain his vision for
PowerShell and how it would change the way we manage systems. You can read more about why he wrote
it in his [Monad Manifesto](https://www.jsnover.com/blog/2011/10/01/monad-manifesto/) blog post.

In that post, he explained how hard it was to communicate the vision for PowerShell to
widely-distrubted development teams. The development teams didn't understand the vision. Writing the
Manifesto forced him to be clear about what problem being addressed, the core principles of the
design, how to address the problem, who would benefit from it, and why.

This is an important document for PowerShell and is provided for historical context. This is a
version of the original Monad Manifesto that articulated the long-term vision and started the
development effort that became PowerShell. PowerShell has delivered on many of the elements
described in this document.
