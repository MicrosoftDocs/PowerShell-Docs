# The Monad Manifesto

Jeffrey Snover, the inventor of PowerShell, wrote the Monad Manifesto to explain his vision for
PowerShell and how it would change the way we manage systems. You can read more about why he wrote
it in his [Monad Manifesto][02] blog post.

In that post, he explained how hard it was to communicate the vision for PowerShell to widely
distributed development teams. The development teams didn't understand the vision. Writing the
Manifesto forced him to be clear about what problem was being addressed, the core principles of the
design, how to address the issue, who would benefit from it, and why.

This document is historically significant to PowerShell. It's a version of the original Monad Manifesto, which articulated the long-term vision and initiated the development effort that became PowerShell. PowerShell has delivered on many of the elements
described in this document.
