# What is Windows PowerShell?

_**Windows PowerShell**_ and _**PowerShell**_ are two separate products.

- _**Windows PowerShell**_ is the version of PowerShell that ships in Windows. This version of
  PowerShell uses the full .NET Framework, which only runs on Windows. The latest version is Windows
  PowerShell 5.1. Microsoft is no longer updating Windows PowerShell with new features. Support for
  Windows PowerShell is tied to the version of Windows you are using.

- _**PowerShell**_ is built on the new versions of .NET instead of the .NET Framework and runs on
  Windows, Linux, and macOS. Support for PowerShell is based on the version of .NET that it was
  built on. For more information about the support lifecycle for PowerShell, see the
  [PowerShell support lifecycle][02] documentation.
