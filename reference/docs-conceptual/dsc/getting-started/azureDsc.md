# Using DSC on Microsoft Azure

Desired State Configuration (DSC) is supported in Microsoft Azure through the
[Azure Desired State Configuration extension handler](/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/dsc-overview)
and through [Azure Automation DSC](/azure/automation/automation-dsc-overview).

## Azure Desired State Configuration extension handler

The [Azure Automation service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/automation/) allows you to
manage DSC configurations, resources, and managed nodes from within Azure. For more information, see
