# Nesting DSC configurations

A nested configuration (also called composite configuration) is a configuration that's called
within another configuration as if it were a resource. Both configurations must be defined in the
same file.

Let's look at a simple example:

```powershell
Configuration FileConfig
{
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [String] $CopyFrom,

        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [String] $CopyTo
    )

    Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration

    File FileTest
    {
        SourcePath = $CopyFrom
        DestinationPath = $CopyTo
        Ensure = 'Present'
    }
}

Configuration NestedFileConfig
{
    Node localhost
    {
        FileConfig NestedConfig
        {
            CopyFrom = 'C:\Test\TestFile.txt'
            CopyTo = 'C:\Test2'
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `FileConfig` takes two mandatory parameters, **CopyFrom** and **CopyTo**, which are
used as the values for the **SourcePath** and **DestinationPath** properties in the `File` resource
block. The `NestedConfig` configuration calls `FileConfig` as if it were a resource. The properties
in the `NestedConfig` resource block (**CopyFrom** and **CopyTo**) are the parameters of the
`FileConfig` configuration.

DSC doesn't currently support nesting configurations within nested configurations. You can only
nest a configuration one layer deep.
