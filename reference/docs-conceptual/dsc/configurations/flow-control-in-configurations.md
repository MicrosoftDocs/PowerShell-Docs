# Conditional statements and loops in a Configuration

You can make your [Configuration](configurations.md) more dynamic by using PowerShell flow-control
keywords. This article shows you how you can use conditional statements and loops to make your
`Configuration` more dynamic. Combining conditional statements and loops with [parameters](add-parameters-to-a-configuration.md)
and [Configuration Data](configData.md) allows you more flexibility and control when compiling your
`Configuration`.

Just like a function or a script block, you can use any PowerShell language feature within a `Configuration`.
The statements you use will only be evaluated when you call your `Configuration` to compile a `.mof`
file. The examples below show scenarios to demonstrate concepts. Conditional statements and
loops are more often used with parameters and configuration Data.

In this  example, the **Service** resource block retrieves the current state of a service at
compile time to generate a `.mof` file that maintains its current state.

> [!NOTE]
> Using dynamic Resource blocks will preempt the effectiveness of Intellisense. The PowerShell parser
> cannot determine if the values specified are acceptable until the `Configuration` is compiled.

```powershell
Configuration ServiceState
{
    # It is best practice to explicitly import any resources used in your Configurations.
    Import-DSCResource -Name Service -Module PSDesiredStateConfiguration
    Node localhost
    {
        Service Spooler
        {
            Name = "Spooler"
            State = $(Get-Service -Name 'spooler').Status
            StartType = $(Get-Service -Name 'spooler').StartType
        }
    }
}
```

Additionally, you could create a **Service** resource block for every service on the current
machine using a `foreach` loop.

```powershell
Configuration ServiceState
{
    # It is best practice to explicitly import any resources used in your Configurations.
    Import-DSCResource -Name Service -Module PSDesiredStateConfiguration
    Node localhost
    {
        foreach ($service in $(Get-Service))
        {
            Service $service.Name
            {
                Name = $service.Name
                State = $service.Status
                StartType = $service.StartType
            }
        }
    }
}
```

You could also create a `Configuration` only for machines that are online by using an `if` statement.

```powershell
Configuration ServiceState
{
    # It is best practice to explicitly import any resources used in your Configurations.
    Import-DSCResource -Name Service -Module PSDesiredStateConfiguration

    foreach ($computer in @('Server01', 'Server02', 'Server03'))
    {
        if (Test-Connection -ComputerName $computer)
        {
            Node $computer
            {
                Service "Spooler"
                {
                    Name = "Spooler"
                    State = "Started"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The dynamic resource blocks in the above examples reference the current machine. In this instance,
> that would be the machine you are authoring the `Configuration` on, not the target Node.

## Summary

In summary, you can use any PowerShell language feature within a `Configuration`.

This includes things like:

- Custom Objects
- Hashtables
- String manipulation
- Remoting
- WMI and CIM
- ActiveDirectory objects
- and more...

Any PowerShell code defined in a `Configuration` is evaluated at compile time, but you can also
place code in the script containing your `Configuration`. Any code outside of the `Configuration` block
is executed when you import your `Configuration`.
