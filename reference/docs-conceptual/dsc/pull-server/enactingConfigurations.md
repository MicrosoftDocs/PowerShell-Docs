# Enacting configurations

> Applies To: Windows PowerShell 4.0, Windows PowerShell 5.0

There are two ways to enact PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) configurations: push mode
and pull mode.

## Push mode

![Push mode](media/enactingConfigurations/pushModel.png "How push mode works")

Push mode refers to a user actively applying a configuration to a target node by calling the
[Start-DscConfiguration](/powershell/module/psdesiredstateconfiguration/start-dscconfiguration)
cmdlet.

After creating and compiling a configuration, you can enact it in push mode by calling the
[Start-DscConfiguration](/powershell/module/psdesiredstateconfiguration/start-dscconfiguration)
cmdlet, setting the -Path parameter of the cmdlet to the path where the configuration MOF is
located. For example, if the configuration MOF is located at `C:\DSC\Configurations\localhost.mof`,
you would apply it to the local machine with the following command:
`Start-DscConfiguration -Path 'C:\DSC\Configurations'`

> [!NOTE]
> By default, DSC runs a configuration as a background job. To run the configuration interactively,
> call the [Start-DscConfiguration](/powershell/module/psdesiredstateconfiguration/start-dscconfiguration)
> with the **Wait** parameter.

## Pull mode

![Pull Mode](media/enactingConfigurations/pullModel.png "How pull mode works")

In pull mode, pull clients are configured to get their desired state configurations from a remote
pull service. Likewise, the pull service has been set up to host the DSC service, and has been
provisioned with the configurations and resources that are required by the pull clients. Each of the
pull clients has a scheduled event that performs a periodic compliance check on the configuration of
the node. When the event is triggered the first time, the Local Configuration Manager (LCM) on the
pull client makes a request to the pull service to get the configuration specified in the LCM. If
that configuration exists on the pull service, and it passes initial validation checks, the
configuration is downloaded to the pull client, where it is then executed by the LCM.

The LCM checks that the client is in compliance with the configuration at regular intervals
specified by the **ConfigurationModeFrequencyMins** property of the LCM. The LCM checks for updated
configurations on the pull service at regular intervals specified by the **RefreshModeFrequency**
property of the LCM. For information about configuring the LCM, see
[Configuring the Local Configuration Manager](../managing-nodes/metaConfig.md).

The recommended solution for hosting a Pull Service, is the DSC cloud service,
[Azure Automation](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/automation/). This is hosted solution
provides graphical management, reporting, and centralized administration.

For more information on setting up a Pull Service on Windows Server, see
[Setting up a DSC web pull server](pullServer.md). Understand however, that this implementation has
limited features and does require some "do it yourself" integration.
