# Securing the MOF File

> Applies To: Windows PowerShell 4.0, Windows PowerShell 5.0

DSC manages the configuration of server nodes by applying information stored in a MOF file, where
the Local Configuration Manager (LCM) implements the desired end state. Because this file contains
the details of the configuration, it's important to keep it secure. This topic describes how to
ensure the target node has encrypted the file.

Beginning with PowerShell version 5.0, the entire MOF file is encrypted by default when it is
applied to the node using the `Start-DSCConfiguration` cmdlet. The process described in this article
is required only when implementing a solution using the pull service protocol if certificates are
not managed, to ensure configurations downloaded by the target node can be decrypted and read by the
system before they are applied (for example, the pull service available in Windows Server). Nodes
registered to
[Azure Automation DSC](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-dsc-overview) will
automatically have certificates installed and managed by the service with no administrative overhead
required.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic discusses certificates used for encryption. For encryption, a self-signed certificate
> is sufficient, because the private key is always kept secret and encryption does not imply trust
> of the document. Self-signed certificates should *not* be used for authentication purposes. You
> should use a certificate from a trusted Certification Authority (CA) for any authentication
> purposes.

## Prerequisites

To successfully encrypt the credentials used to secure a DSC configuration, make sure you have the
following:

- **Some means of issuing and distributing certificates**. This topic and its examples assume you
  are using Active Directory Certification Authority. For more background information on Active
  Directory Certificate Services, see
  [Active Directory Certificate Services Overview](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831740.aspx)
  and
  [Active Directory Certificate Services in Windows Server 2008](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/dd448615.aspx).
- **Administrative access to the target node or nodes**.
- **Each target node has an encryption-capable certificate saved its Personal Store**. In Windows
  PowerShell, the path to the store is Cert:\LocalMachine\My. The examples in this topic use the
  "workstation authentication" template, which you can find (along with other certificate templates)
  at [Default Certificate Templates](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc740061(v=WS.10).aspx).
- If you will be running this configuration on a computer other than the target node, **export the
  public key of the certificate**, and then import it to the computer you will run the configuration
  from. Make sure that you export only the **public** key; keep the private key secure.

## Overall process

 1. Set up the certificates, keys, and thumbprints, making sure that each target node has copies of
    the certificate and the configuration computer has the public key and thumbprint.
 2. Create a configuration data block that contains the path and thumbprint of the public key.
 3. Create a configuration script that defines your desired configuration for the target node and
    sets up decryption on the target nodes by commanding the Local Configuration manager to decrypt
    the configuration data using the certificate and its thumbprint.
 4. Run the configuration, which will set the Local Configuration Manager settings and start the DSC
    configuration.

## Certificate Requirements

To enact credential encryption, a public key certificate must be available on the _Target Node_ that
is **trusted** by the computer being used to author the DSC configuration. This public key
certificate has specific requirements for it to be used for DSC credential encryption:

1. **Key Usage**:
   - Must contain: 'KeyEncipherment' and 'DataEncipherment'.
   - Should _not_ contain: 'Digital Signature'.
2. **Enhanced Key Usage**:
   - Must contain: Document Encryption (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.80.1).
   - Should _not_ contain: Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2) and Server Authentication
     (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1).
3. The Private Key for the certificate is available on the *Target Node_.
4. The **Provider** for the certificate must be "Microsoft RSA SChannel Cryptographic Provider".

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although you can use a certificate with containing a Key Usage of 'Digital Signature' or one of
> the Authentication EKU's, this will enable the encryption key to be more easily misused and
> vulnerable to attack. So it is best practice to use a certificate created specifically for the
> purpose of securing DSC credentials that omits these Key Usage and EKUs.

Any existing certificate on the _Target Node_ that meets these criteria can be used to secure DSC
credentials.

## Certificate creation

There are two approaches you can take to create and use the required Encryption Certificate
(public-private key pair).

1. Create it on the **Target Node** and export just the public key to the **Authoring Node**
2. Create it on the **Authoring Node** and export the entire key pair to the **Target Node**

Method 1 is recommended because the private key used to decrypt credentials in the MOF stays on the
Target Node at all times.

### Creating the Certificate on the Target Node

The private key must be kept secret, because is used to decrypt the MOF on the **Target Node** The
easiest way to do that is to create the private key certificate on the **Target Node**, and copy the
**public key certificate** to the computer being used to author the DSC configuration into a MOF
file. The following example:

1. creates a certificate on the **Target node**
2. exports the public key certificate on the **Target node**.
3. imports the public key certificate into the **my** certificate store on the **Authoring node**.

#### On the Target Node: create and export the certificate

> Target Node: Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10

```powershell
# note: These steps need to be performed in an Administrator PowerShell session
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type DocumentEncryptionCertLegacyCsp -DnsName 'DscEncryptionCert' -HashAlgorithm SHA256
# export the public key certificate
$cert | Export-Certificate -FilePath "$env:temp\DscPublicKey.cer" -Force
```

Once exported, the `DscPublicKey.cer` would need to be copied to the **Authoring Node**.

> Target Node: Windows Server 2012 R2/Windows 8.1 and earlier
> [!WARNING]
> Because the `New-SelfSignedCertificate` cmdlet on Windows Operating Systems prior to Windows 10
> and Windows Server 2016 do not support the **Type** parameter, an alternate method of creating
> this certificate is required on these operating systems. In this case you can use `makecert.exe`
> or `certutil.exe` to create the certificate. An alternate method is to
> [download the New-SelfSignedCertificateEx.ps1 script from Microsoft Script Center](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Self-signed-certificate-5920a7c6)
> and use it to create the certificate instead:

```powershell
# note: These steps need to be performed in an Administrator PowerShell session
# and in the folder that contains New-SelfSignedCertificateEx.ps1
. .\New-SelfSignedCertificateEx.ps1
New-SelfsignedCertificateEx `
    -Subject "CN=${ENV:ComputerName}" `
    -EKU 'Document Encryption' `
    -KeyUsage 'KeyEncipherment, DataEncipherment' `
    -SAN ${ENV:ComputerName} `
    -FriendlyName 'DSC Credential Encryption certificate' `
    -Exportable `
    -StoreLocation 'LocalMachine' `
    -KeyLength 2048 `
    -ProviderName 'Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0' `
    -AlgorithmName 'RSA' `
    -SignatureAlgorithm 'SHA256'
# Locate the newly created certificate
$Cert = Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My | Where-Object {
        ($_.FriendlyName -eq 'DSC Credential Encryption certificate') -and ($_.Subject -eq "CN=${ENV:ComputerName}")
    } | Select-Object -First 1
# export the public key certificate
$cert | Export-Certificate -FilePath "$env:temp\DscPublicKey.cer" -Force
```

Once exported, the ```DscPublicKey.cer``` would need to be copied to the **Authoring Node**.

#### On the Authoring Node: import the cert's public key

```powershell
# Import to the my store
Import-Certificate -FilePath "$env:temp\DscPublicKey.cer" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My
```

### Creating the Certificate on the Authoring Node

Alternately, the encryption certificate can be created on the **Authoring Node**, exported with the
**private key** as a PFX file and then imported on the **Target Node**. This is the current method
for implementing DSC credential encryption on _Nano Server_. Although the PFX is secured with a
password it should be kept secure during transit. The following example:

1. creates a certificate on the **Authoring node**.
2. exports the certificate including the private key on the **Authoring node**.
3. removes the private key from the **Authoring node**, but keeps the public key certificate in the **my** store.
4. imports the private key certificate into the My(Personal) certificate store on the **Target node**.
   - it must be added to the root store so that it will be trusted by the **Target node**.

#### On the Authoring Node: create and export the certificate

> Target Node: Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10

```powershell
# note: These steps need to be performed in an Administrator PowerShell session
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type DocumentEncryptionCertLegacyCsp -DnsName 'DscEncryptionCert' -HashAlgorithm SHA256
# export the private key certificate
$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "YOUR_PFX_PASSWD" -Force -AsPlainText
$cert | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath "$env:temp\DscPrivateKey.pfx" -Password $mypwd -Force
# remove the private key certificate from the node but keep the public key certificate
$cert | Export-Certificate -FilePath "$env:temp\DscPublicKey.cer" -Force
$cert | Remove-Item -Force
Import-Certificate -FilePath "$env:temp\DscPublicKey.cer" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My
```

Once exported, the `DscPrivateKey.pfx` would need to be copied to the **Target Node**.

    -SignatureAlgorithm 'SHA256'
# Locate the newly created certificate
$Cert = Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My | Where-Object {
        ($_.FriendlyName -eq 'DSC Credential Encryption certificate') -and ($_.Subject -eq "CN=${ENV:ComputerName}")
    } | Select-Object -First 1
# export the public key certificate
$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "YOUR_PFX_PASSWD" -Force -AsPlainText
$cert | Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath "$env:temp\DscPrivateKey.pfx" -Password $mypwd -Force
# remove the private key certificate from the node but keep the public key certificate
$cert | Export-Certificate -FilePath "$env:temp\DscPublicKey.cer" -Force
$cert | Remove-Item -Force
Import-Certificate -FilePath "$env:temp\DscPublicKey.cer" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My
```

#### On the Target Node: import the cert's private key as a trusted root

```powershell
# Import to the root store so that it is trusted
$mypwd = ConvertTo-SecureString -String "YOUR_PFX_PASSWD" -Force -AsPlainText
Import-PfxCertificate -FilePath "$env:temp\DscPrivateKey.pfx" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My -Password $mypwd > $null
```

## Configuration data

The configuration data block defines which target nodes to operate on, whether or not to encrypt the
credentials, the means of encryption, and other information. For more information on the
configuration data block, see
[Separating Configuration and Environment Data](../configurations/configData.md).

The elements that can be configured for each node that are related to credential encryption are:

- **NodeName** - the name of the target node that the credential encryption is being configured for.
- **PsDscAllowPlainTextPassword** - whether unencrypted credentials will be allowed to be passed to
  this node. This is **not recommended**.
- **Thumbprint** - the thumbprint of the certificate that will be used to decrypt the credentials in
  the DSC Configuration on the _Target Node_. **This certificate must exist in the Local Machine
  certificate store on the Target Node.**
- **CertificateFile** - the certificate file (containing the public key only) that should be used to
  encrypt the credentials for the _Target Node_. This must be either a DER encoded binary X.509 or
  Base-64 encoded X.509 format certificate file.

This example shows a configuration data block that specifies a target node to act on named
targetNode, the path to the public key certificate file (named targetNode.cer), and the thumbprint
for the public key.

```powershell
$ConfigData= @{
    AllNodes = @(
            @{
                # The name of the node we are describing
                NodeName = "targetNode"

                # The path to the .cer file containing the
                # public key of the Encryption Certificate
                # used to encrypt credentials for this node
                CertificateFile = "C:\publicKeys\targetNode.cer"


                # The thumbprint of the Encryption Certificate
                # used to decrypt the credentials on target node
                Thumbprint = "AC23EA3A9E291A75757A556D0B71CBBF8C4F6FD8"
            };
        );
    }
```

## Configuration script

In the configuration script itself, use the `PsCredential` parameter to ensure that credentials are
stored for the shortest possible time. When you run the supplied example, DSC will prompt you for
credentials and then encrypt the MOF file using the CertificateFile that is associated with the
target node in the configuration data block. This code example copies a file from a share that is
secured to a user.

```powershell
configuration CredentialEncryptionExample
{
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [ValidateNotNullorEmpty()]
        [PsCredential] $credential
        )


    Node $AllNodes.NodeName
    {
        File exampleFile
        {
            SourcePath = "\\Server\share\path\file.ext"
            DestinationPath = "C:\destinationPath"
            Credential = $credential
        }
    }
}
```

## Setting up decryption

Before [`Start-DscConfiguration`](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn521623.aspx) can work, you
have to tell the Local Configuration Manager on each target node which certificate to use to decrypt
the credentials, using the CertificateID resource to verify the certificate's thumbprint. This
example function will find the appropriate local certificate (you might have to customize it so it
will find the exact certificate you want to use):

```powershell
# Get the certificate that works for encryption
function Get-LocalEncryptionCertificateThumbprint
{
    (dir Cert:\LocalMachine\my) | %{
        # Verify the certificate is for Encryption and valid
        if ($_.PrivateKey.KeyExchangeAlgorithm -and $_.Verify())
        {
            return $_.Thumbprint
        }
    }
}
```

With the certificate identified by its thumbprint, the configuration script can be updated to use
the value:

```powershell
configuration CredentialEncryptionExample
{
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [ValidateNotNullorEmpty()]
        [PsCredential] $credential
        )


    Node $AllNodes.NodeName
    {
        File exampleFile
        {
            SourcePath = "\\Server\share\path\file.ext"
            DestinationPath = "C:\destinationPath"
            Credential = $credential
        }

        LocalConfigurationManager
        {
             CertificateId = $node.Thumbprint
        }
    }
}
```

## Running the configuration

At this point, you can run the configuration, which will output two files:

- A *.meta.mof file that configures the Local Configuration Manager to decrypt the credentials using
  the certificate that is stored on the local machine store and identified by its thumbprint.
  [`Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager`](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn521621.aspx) applies
  the *.meta.mof file.
- A MOF file that actually applies the configuration. Start-DscConfiguration applies the configuration.

These commands will accomplish those steps:

```powershell
Write-Host "Generate DSC Configuration..."
CredentialEncryptionExample -ConfigurationData $ConfigData -OutputPath .\CredentialEncryptionExample

Write-Host "Setting up LCM to decrypt credentials..."
Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager .\CredentialEncryptionExample -Verbose

Write-Host "Starting Configuration..."
Start-DscConfiguration .\CredentialEncryptionExample -wait -Verbose
```

This example would push the DSC configuration to the target node. The DSC configuration can also be
applied using a DSC Pull Server if one is available.

See [Setting up a DSC pull client](pullClient.md) for more information on applying DSC
configurations using a DSC Pull Server.

## Credential Encryption Module Example

Here is a full example that incorporates all of these steps, plus a helper cmdlet that exports and
copies the public keys:

```powershell
# A simple example of using credentials
configuration CredentialEncryptionExample
{
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [ValidateNotNullorEmpty()]
        [PsCredential] $credential
        )


    Node $AllNodes.NodeName
    {
        File exampleFile
        {
            SourcePath = "\\server\share\file.txt"
            DestinationPath = "C:\Users\user"
            Credential = $credential
        }

        LocalConfigurationManager
        {
            CertificateId = $node.Thumbprint
        }
    }
}

# To encrypt the configuration credentials

    [CmdletBinding()]
    param ($computerName)
