# Troubleshooting DSC

> Applies To: Windows PowerShell 4.0, Windows PowerShell 5.0

This article provides troubleshooting instruction for common errors.

## WinRM Dependency

Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) depends on WinRM. WinRM is not enabled by
default on Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7. Run `Set-WSManQuickConfig`, in a Windows
PowerShell elevated session, to enable WinRM.

## Using Get-DscConfigurationStatus

The [Get-DscConfigurationStatus](/powershell/module/PSDesiredStateConfiguration/Get-DscConfigurationStatus)
cmdlet gets information about configuration status from a target node. A rich object is returned
that includes high-level information about whether or not the configuration run was successful or
not. You can dig into the object to discover details about the configuration run such as:

- All of the resources that failed
- Any resource that requested a reboot
- Meta-Configuration settings at time of configuration run
- Etc.

The following parameter set returns the status information for the last configuration run:

```
Get-DscConfigurationStatus [-CimSession <CimSession[]>]
                           [-ThrottleLimit <int>]
                           [-AsJob]
                           [<CommonParameters>]
```

The following parameter set returns the status information for all previous configuration runs:

```
Get-DscConfigurationStatus -All
                           [-CimSession <CimSession[]>]
                           [-ThrottleLimit <int>]
                           [-AsJob]
                           [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Example

```powershell
PS C:\> $Status = Get-DscConfigurationStatus

PS C:\> $Status

Status         StartDate                Type            Mode    RebootRequested        NumberOfResources

## My script won't run: Using DSC logs to diagnose script errors

Like all Windows software, DSC records errors and events in
[logs](/windows/desktop/EventLog/about-event-logging) that can be viewed from the
[Event Viewer](https://support.microsoft.com/hub/4338813/windows-help). Examining these logs can
help you understand why a particular operation failed, and how to prevent failure in the future.
Writing configuration scripts can be tricky, so to make tracking errors easier as you author, use
the DSC Log resource to track the progress of your configuration in the DSC Analytic event log.

## Where are DSC event logs?

In Event Viewer, DSC events are in: **Applications and Services Logs/Microsoft/Windows/Desired State Configuration**

The corresponding PowerShell cmdlet,
[Get-WinEvent](/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Diagnostics/Get-WinEvent), can also be run to view the
event logs:

```
PS C:\> Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-Dsc/Operational"

   ProviderName: Microsoft-Windows-DSC

TimeCreated                     Id LevelDisplayName Message
-----------                     -- ---------------- -------
11/17/2014 10:27:23 PM        4102 Information      Job {02C38626-D95A-47F1-9DA2-C1D44A7128E7} :
```

As shown above, DSC's primary log name is **Microsoft->Windows->DSC** (other log names under Windows
are not shown here for brevity). The primary name is appended to the channel name to create the
complete log name. The DSC engine writes mainly into three types of logs:
[Operational, Analytic, and Debug logs](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc722404(v=ws.11)).
Since the analytic and debug logs are turned off by default, you should enable them in Event Viewer.
To do this, open Event Viewer by typing Show-EventLog in Windows PowerShell; or, click the **Start**
button, click **Control Panel**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Event Viewer**. On
the **View** menu in Event viewer, click **Show Analytic and Debug Logs**. The log name for the
analytic channel is **Microsoft-Windows-Dsc/Analytic**, and the debug channel is
**Microsoft-Windows-Dsc/Debug**. You could also use the
[wevtutil](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/cc732848(v=ws.11))
utility to enable the logs, as shown in the following example.

```powershell
wevtutil.exe set-log "Microsoft-Windows-Dsc/Analytic" /q:true /e:true
```

## What do DSC logs contain?

DSC logs are split over the three log channels based on the importance of the message. The
operational log in DSC contains all error messages, and can be used to identify a problem. The
analytic log has a higher volume of events, and can identify where error(s) occurred. This channel
also contains verbose messages (if any). The debug log contains logs that can help you understand
how the errors occurred. DSC event messages are structured such that every event message begins
with a job ID that uniquely represents a DSC operation. The example below attempts to obtain the
message from the first event logged into the operational DSC log.

```powershell
PS C:\> $AllDscOpEvents = Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-Dsc/Operational"
PS C:\> $FirstOperationalEvent = $AllDscOpEvents[0]
PS C:\> $FirstOperationalEvent.Message
Job {02C38626-D95A-47F1-9DA2-C1D44A7128E7} :
Consistency engine was run successfully.
```

DSC events are logged in a particular structure that enables the user to aggregate events from one
DSC job. The structure is as follows:

```
Job ID : <Guid>
<Event Message>
```

## Gathering events from a single DSC operation

DSC event logs contain events generated by various DSC operations. However, you'll usually be
concerned with the detail about just one particular operation. All DSC logs can be grouped by the
job ID property that is unique for every DSC operation. The job ID is displayed as the first
property value in all DSC events. The following steps explain how to accumulate all events in a
grouped array structure.

```powershell
<##########################################################################
 Step 1 : Enable analytic and debug DSC channels (Operational channel is enabled by default)
###########################################################################>

wevtutil.exe set-log "Microsoft-Windows-Dsc/Analytic" /q:true /e:true
wevtutil.exe set-log "Microsoft-Windows-Dsc/Debug" /q:True /e:true

<##########################################################################
 Step 2 : Perform the required DSC operation (Below is an example, you could run any DSC operation instead)
###########################################################################>

Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager

<##########################################################################
Step 3 : Collect all DSC Logs, from the Analytic, Debug and Operational channels
###########################################################################>

$DscEvents=[System.Array](Get-WinEvent "Microsoft-Windows-Dsc/Operational") `
         + [System.Array](Get-WinEvent "Microsoft-Windows-Dsc/Analytic" -Oldest) `
         + [System.Array](Get-WinEvent "Microsoft-Windows-Dsc/Debug" -Oldest)


<##########################################################################
 Step 4 : Group all logs based on the job ID
###########################################################################>
$SeparateDscOperations = $DscEvents | Group {$_.Properties[0].value}
```

Here, the variable `$SeparateDscOperations` contains logs grouped by the job IDs. Each array element
of this variable represents a group of events logged by a different DSC operation, allowing access
to more information about the logs.

```

```

You can extract the data in the variable `$SeparateDscOperations` using
[Where-Object](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/where-object). Following are five
scenarios in which you might want to extract data for troubleshooting DSC:

### 1: Operations failures

All events have [severity levels](/windows/desktop/WES/defining-severity-levels). This information
can be used to identify the error events:

```
PS C:\> $SeparateDscOperations | Where-Object {$_.Group.LevelDisplayName -contains "Error"}

Count Name                      Group
----- ----                      -----
   38 {5BCA8BE7-5BB6-11E3-BF... {System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.EventLogRecord, System.Diagnostics....
```

### 2: Details of operations run in the last half hour

`TimeCreated`, a property of every Windows event, states the time the event was created. Comparing
this property with a particular date/time object can be used to filter all events:

```powershell
PS C:\> $DateLatest = (Get-Date).AddMinutes(-30)
PS C:\> $SeparateDscOperations | Where-Object {$_.Group.TimeCreated -gt $DateLatest}

Count Name                      Group
----- ----                      -----
    1 {6CEC5B09-5BB0-11E3-BF... {System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.EventLogRecord}
```

### 3: Messages from the latest operation

The latest operation is stored in the first index of the array group `$SeparateDscOperations`.
Querying the group's messages for index 0 returns all messages for the latest operation:

```powershell
PS C:\> $SeparateDscOperations[0].Group.Message
Job {5BCA8BE7-5BB6-11E3-BF41-00155D553612} :
Running consistency engine.
Job {1A776B6A-5BAC-11E3-BF41-00155D553612} :
Configuration is sent from computer NULL by user sid S-1-5-18.
Job {1A776B6A-5BAC-11E3-BF41-00155D553612} :
Displaying messages from built-in DSC resources:
 WMI channel 1
 ResourceID:
 Message : [INCH-VM]:                            [] Starting consistency engine.
Job {1A776B6A-5BAC-11E3-BF41-00155D553612} :
Displaying messages from built-in DSC resources:
 WMI channel 1
 ResourceID:
 Message : [INCH-VM]:                            [] Consistency check completed.
```

### 4: Error messages logged for recent failed operations

`$SeparateDscOperations[0].Group` contains a set of events for the latest operation. Run the
`Where-Object` cmdlet to filter the events based on their level display name. Results are stored in
the `$myFailedEvent` variable, which can be further dissected to get the event message:

```powershell
PS C:\> $myFailedEvent = ($SeparateDscOperations[0].Group | Where-Object {$_.LevelDisplayName -eq "Error"})

PS C:\> $myFailedEvent.Message

Job {5BCA8BE7-5BB6-11E3-BF41-00155D553612} :
DSC Engine Error :
 Error Message Current configuration does not exist. Execute Start-DscConfiguration command with
 -Path parameter to specify a configuration file and create a current configuration first.
Error Code : 1
```

### 5: All events generated for a particular job ID.

`$SeparateDscOperations` is an array of groups, each of which has the name as the unique job ID. By
running the `Where-Object` cmdlet, you can extract those groups of events that have a particular job
ID:

```powershell
PS C:\> ($SeparateDscOperations | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq $jobX} ).Group

   ProviderName: Microsoft-Windows-DSC

TimeCreated                     Id LevelDisplayName Message
-----------                     -- ---------------- -------

12/2/2013 4:33:24 PM          4146 Information      Job {847A5619-5BB2-11E3-BF41-00155D553612} : ...
12/2/2013 4:33:24 PM          4120 Information      Job {847A5619-5BB2-11E3-BF41-00155D553612} : ...
```

## Using xDscDiagnostics to analyze DSC logs

**xDscDiagnostics** is a PowerShell module that consists of several functions that can help analyze
DSC failures on your machine. These functions can help you identify all local events from past DSC
operations, or DSC events on remote computers (with valid credentials). Here, the term DSC
operation is used to define a single unique DSC execution from its start to its end. For example,
`Test-DscConfiguration` would be a separate DSC operation. Similarly, every other cmdlet in DSC
(such as `Get-DscConfiguration`, `Start-DscConfiguration`, etc.) could each be identified as
separate DSC operations. The functions are explained at
[xDscDiagnostics](https://github.com/PowerShell/xDscDiagnostics). Help is available by running
`Get-Help <cmdlet name>`.

### Getting details of DSC operations

The `Get-xDscOperation` function lets you find the results of the DSC operations that run on one or
multiple computers, and returns an object that contains the collection of events produced by each
DSC operation. For example, in the following output, three commands were run. The first one passed,
and the other two failed. These results are summarized in the output of `Get-xDscOperation`.

```powershell
PS C:\DiagnosticsTest> Get-xDscOperation

ComputerName   SequenceId TimeCreated           Result   JobID                                 AllEvents
------------   ---------- -----------           ------   -----                                 ---------
SRV1   1          6/23/2016 9:37:52 AM  Failure  9701aadf-395e-11e6-9165-00155d390509  {@{Message=; TimeC...
SRV1   2          6/23/2016 9:36:54 AM  Failure  7e8e2d6e-395c-11e6-9165-00155d390509  {@{Message=; TimeC...

```

You can also specify that you want only results for the most recent operations by using the
`Newest` parameter:

```powershell
PS C:\DiagnosticsTest> Get-xDscOperation -Newest 5
ComputerName   SequenceId TimeCreated           Result   JobID                                 AllEvents
------------   ---------- -----------           ------   -----                                 ---------
SRV1   1          6/23/2016 4:36:54 PM  Success                                        {@{Message=; TimeC...

```

### Getting details of DSC events

The `Trace-xDscOperation` cmdlet returns an object containing a collection of events, their event
types, and the message output generated from a particular DSC operation. Typically, when you find a
failure in any of the operations using `Get-xDscOperation`, you would trace that operation to find
out which of the events caused a failure.

Use the `SequenceID` parameter to get the events for a specific operation for a specific computer.
For example, if you specify a `SequenceID` of 9, `Trace-xDscOperaion` get the trace for the DSC
operation that was 9th from the last operation:

```powershell
PS C:\DiagnosticsTest> Trace-xDscOperation -SequenceID 9

ComputerName   EventType    TimeCreated           Message
------------   ---------    -----------           -------
SRV1   OPERATIONAL  6/24/2016 10:51:52 AM Operation Consistency Check or Pull started by user sid S-1-5-20 from computer NULL.
SRV1   OPERATIONAL  6/24/2016 10:51:52 AM Running consistency engine.
SRV1   OPERATIONAL  6/24/2016 10:51:52 AM The local configuration manager is updating the PSModulePath to WindowsPowerShell\Modules;C:\Prog...
SRV1   OPERATIONAL  6/24/2016 10:51:53 AM  Resource execution sequence :: [WindowsFeature]DSCServiceFeature, [xDSCWebService]PSDSCPullServer.
SRV1   OPERATIONAL  6/24/2016 10:51:54 AM Consistency engine was run successfully.
SRV1   OPERATIONAL  6/24/2016 10:51:54 AM Job runs under the following LCM setting. ...
SRV1   OPERATIONAL  6/24/2016 10:51:54 AM Operation Consistency Check or Pull completed successfully.
```

Pass the **GUID** assigned to a specific DSC operation (as returned by the `Get-xDscOperation`
cmdlet) to get the event details for that DSC operation:

```powershell
PS C:\DiagnosticsTest> Trace-xDscOperation -JobID 9e0bfb6b-3a3a-11e6-9165-00155d390509

Note that, since `Trace-xDscOperation` aggregates events from the Analytic, Debug, and Operational
logs, it will prompt you to enable these logs as described above.

Alternately, you can gather information on the events by saving the output of `Trace-xDscOperation`
into a variable. You can use the following commands to display all the events for a particular DSC
operation.

```powershell
PS C:\DiagnosticsTest> $Trace = Trace-xDscOperation -SequenceID 4

PS C:\DiagnosticsTest> $Trace.Event
```

This will display the same results as the `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet, such as in the output below:

```

Ideally, you would first use `Get-xDscOperation` to list out the last few DSC configuration runs on
your machines. Following this, you can examine any single operation (using its SequenceID or JobID)
with `Trace-xDscOperation` to discover what it did behind the scenes.

### Getting events for a remote computer

Use the `ComputerName` parameter of the `Trace-xDscOperation` cmdlet to get the event details on a
remote computer. Before you can do this, you have to create a firewall rule to allow remote
administration on the remote computer:

```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -Name "Service RemoteAdmin" -DisplayName "Remote" -Action Allow
```

Now you can specify that computer in your call to `Trace-xDscOperation`:

```powershell
PS C:\DiagnosticsTest> Trace-xDscOperation -ComputerName SRV2 -Credential Get-Credential -SequenceID 5

## My resources won't update: How to reset the cache

The DSC engine caches resources implemented as a PowerShell module for efficiency purposes.
However, this can cause problems when you are authoring a resource and testing it simultaneously
because DSC will load the cached version until the process is restarted. The only way to make DSC
load the newer version is to explicitly kill the process hosting the DSC engine.

Similarly, when you run `Start-DscConfiguration`, after adding and modifying a custom resource, the
modification may not execute unless, or until, the computer is rebooted. This is because DSC runs
in the WMI Provider Host Process (WmiPrvSE), and usually, there are many instances of WmiPrvSE
running at once. When you reboot, the host process is restarted and the cache is cleared.

To successfully recycle the configuration and clear the cache without rebooting, you must stop and
then restart the host process. This can be done on a per instance basis, whereby you identify the
process, stop it, and restart it. Or, you can use `DebugMode`, as demonstrated below, to reload the
PowerShell DSC resource.

To identify which process is hosting the DSC engine and stop it on a per instance basis, you can
list the process ID of the WmiPrvSE which is hosting the DSC engine. Then, to update the provider,
stop the WmiPrvSE process using the commands below, and then run **Start-DscConfiguration** again.

```powershell
###
### find the process that is hosting the DSC engine
###
$dscProcessID = Get-WmiObject msft_providers |
Where-Object {$_.provider -like 'dsccore'} |
Select-Object -ExpandProperty HostProcessIdentifier

###
### Stop the process
###
Get-Process -Id $dscProcessID | Stop-Process
```

## Using DebugMode

You can configure the DSC Local Configuration Manager (LCM) to use `DebugMode` to always clear the
cache when the host process is restarted. When set to **TRUE**, it causes the engine to always
reload the PowerShell DSC resource. Once you are done writing your resource, you can set it back to
**FALSE** and the engine will revert to its behavior of caching the modules.

Following is a demonstration to show how `DebugMode` can automatically refresh the cache. First,
let's look at the default configuration:

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager
```

```output
AllowModuleOverwrite           : False
CertificateID                  :
ConfigurationID                :
ConfigurationMode              : ApplyAndMonitor
ConfigurationModeFrequencyMins : 30
Credential                     :
DebugMode                      : {None}
DownloadManagerCustomData      :
DownloadManagerName            :
LocalConfigurationManagerState : Ready
RebootNodeIfNeeded             : False
RefreshFrequencyMins           : 15
RefreshMode                    : PUSH
PSComputerName                 :
```

You can see that `DebugMode` is set to **"None"**.

To set up the `DebugMode` demonstration, use the following PowerShell resource:

```powershell
function Get-TargetResource
{
    param
    (
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        $onlyProperty
    )
    return @{onlyProperty = Get-Content -Path "$env:SystemDrive\OutputFromTestProviderDebugMode.txt"}
}
function Set-TargetResource
{
    param
    (
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        $onlyProperty
    )
    "1" | Out-File -PSPath "$env:SystemDrive\OutputFromTestProviderDebugMode.txt"
}
function Test-TargetResource
{
    param
    (
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        $onlyProperty
    )
    return $false
}
```

Now, author a configuration using the above resource called `TestProviderDebugMode`:

```powershell
Configuration ConfigTestDebugMode
{
    Import-DscResource -Name TestProviderDebugMode
    Node localhost
    {
        TestProviderDebugMode test
        {
            onlyProperty = "blah"
        }
    }
}
ConfigTestDebugMode
```

You will see that the contents of file: `$env:SystemDrive\OutputFromTestProviderDebugMode.txt` is
**1**.

Now, update the provider code using the following script:

```powershell
$newResourceOutput = Get-Random -Minimum 5 -Maximum 30
$content = @"
function Get-TargetResource
{
    param
    (
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        `$onlyProperty
    )
    return @{onlyProperty = Get-Content -Path "$env:SystemDrive\OutputFromTestProviderDebugMode.txt"}
}
function Set-TargetResource
{
    param
    (
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        `$onlyProperty
    )
    "$newResourceOutput" | Out-File -PSPath C:\OutputFromTestProviderDebugMode.txt
}
function Test-TargetResource
{
    param
    (
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        `$onlyProperty
    )
    return `$false
}
"@ | Out-File -FilePath "C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\MyPowerShellModules\DSCResources\TestProviderDebugMode\TestProviderDebugMode.psm1
```

This script generates a random number and updates the provider code accordingly. With `DebugMode`
set to false, the contents of the file `$env:SystemDrive\OutputFromTestProviderDebugMode.txt`
are never changed.

Now, set `DebugMode` to **"ForceModuleImport"** in your configuration script:

```powershell
LocalConfigurationManager
{
    DebugMode = "ForceModuleImport"
}
```

When you run the above script again, you will see that the content of the file is different every
time. (You can run `Get-DscConfiguration` to check it). Below is the result of two additional runs
(your results may be different when you run the script):

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-DscConfiguration -CimSession (New-CimSession localhost)

onlyProperty                            PSComputerName
------------                            --------------
20                                      localhost

PS C:\> Get-DscConfiguration -CimSession (New-CimSession localhost)

onlyProperty                            PSComputerName
------------                            --------------
14                                      localhost
```

## DSC returns "unexpected response code InternalServerError" when registering with Windows Pull Server

When applying a metaconfiguration to a server to register it with an instance of Windows Pull Server,
you might encounter the following error.

```
Registration of the Dsc Agent with the server https://<serverfqdn>:8080/PSDSCPullServer.svc failed. The underlying error is: The attempt to register Dsc Agent with AgentId <ID> with the server
https://<serverfqdn>:8080/PSDSCPullServer.svc/Nodes(AgentId='<ID>') returned unexpected response code InternalServerError. .
    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidResult: (root/Microsoft/...gurationManager:String) [], CimException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : RegisterDscAgentUnsuccessful,Microsoft.PowerShell.DesiredStateConfiguration.Commands.RegisterDscAgentCommand
    + PSComputerName        : <computername>
```

This can occur when the certificate used on the server to encrypt traffic has a common name (CN)
that is different than the DNS name used by the node to resolve the URL. Update the Windows Pull
Server instance to use a certificate with a corrected name.

## Error when running Sysprep after applying a DSC Configuration

When attempting to run Sysprep to generalize a Windows Server after applying a DSC configuration,
you might encounter the following error.

```
SYSPRP LaunchDll:Failure occurred while executing 'DscCore.dll,SysPrep_Cleanup', returned error code 0x2
```

Generalizing a server after it has been configured using Windows PowerShell Desired State
Configuration is not a supported scenario. Instead, apply configurations to Windows after the
Specialize phase of Windows Setup has completed.
