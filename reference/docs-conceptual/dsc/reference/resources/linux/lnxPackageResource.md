# DSC for Linux nxPackage Resource

The **nxPackage** resource in PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) provides a mechanism to
manage packages on a Linux node.

## Syntax

```Syntax
nxPackage <string> #ResourceName
{
    Name = <string>
    [ PackageManager = <string> { Yum | Apt | Zypper } ]
    [ PackageGroup = <bool>]
    [ Arguments = <string> ]
    [ ReturnCode = <uint32> ]
    [ FilePath = <string> ]
    [ DependsOn = <string[]> ]
    [ Ensure = <string> { Absent | Present }  ]
}
```

## Properties

|Property |Description |
|---|---|
|Name |The name of the package for which you want to ensure a specific state. |
|PackageManager |Supported values are **yum**, **apt**, and **zypper**. Specifies the package manager to use when installing packages. If **FilePath** is specified, the provided path will be used to install the package. Otherwise, a Package Manager will be used to install the package from a pre-configured repository. If neither **PackageManager** nor **FilePath** are provided, the default package manager for the system will be used. |
|PackageGroup |If `$true`, the **Name** is expected to be the name of a package group for use with a **PackageManager**. **PackageGroup** is not valid when providing a **FilePath**. |
|Arguments |A string of arguments that will be passed to the package exactly as provided. |
|ReturnCode |The expected return code. If the actual return code does not match the expected value provided here, the configuration will return an error. |
|FilePath |The file path where the package resides. |

## Common properties

|Property |Description |
|---|---|
|DependsOn |Indicates that the configuration of another resource must run before this resource is configured. For example, if the ID of the resource configuration script block that you want to run first is ResourceName and its type is ResourceType, the syntax for using this property is `DependsOn = "[ResourceType]ResourceName"`. |
|Ensure |Determines whether to check if the package exists. Set this property to **Present** to ensure the package exists. Set it to **Absent** to ensure the package does not exist. The default value is **Present**. |

## Example

The following example ensures that the package named "httpd" is installed on a Linux computer, using
the "Yum" package manager.

```powershell
Import-DSCResource -Module nx

Node $node
{
    nxPackage httpd
    {
        Name = "httpd"
        Ensure = "Present"
        PackageManager = "Yum"
    }
}
```
