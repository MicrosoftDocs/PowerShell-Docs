# The PowerShell Style Guide

## Introduction

In the Python community, developers have a great programming style reference provided as part of the
language enhancement process specifications ([PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)),
but in the PowerShell world there has been no official documentation of community preferences.

This document is an attempt to come to an agreement on a style-guide because we know that the more
people follow the same set of code-style habits, the more readable the community's code will be. In
other words, although the recommendations of this guide are _just recommendations_, if you follow
them, you will write PowerShell code that is more easily read, understood, and maintained.
