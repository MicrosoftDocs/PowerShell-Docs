# How to create a feedback provider

PowerShell 7.4-preview.2 introduces the concept of feedback providers. A feedback provider is a
PowerShell module that utilizes the `IFeedbackProvider` interface that will trigger on a user action
and give feedback to the user.

Feedback providers are PowerShell modules that can give suggestions to the user based on what they
are trying to execute in the shell. They currently trigger when there is a success or failure of
execution. Feedback providers can take the specific information from successes and failures and
based on that information, trigger and provide feedback to the user.

## System requirements

To create and use a feedback provider, you must be using the following software versions:

- PowerShell 7.4-preview.2 or higher - includes the feedback provider interface
- .NET 8 SDK 

## Overview of a feedback provider

A feedback provider is a PowerShell binary module. The module must implement the
`using System.Management.Automation.Subsystem.Feedback` interface. This interface
declares the methods used to get feedback based on the command line input. Currently it can trigger on success and errors of execution and provide the necessary information for

## Creating the code

You must have .NET 8 SDK installed to create a feedback provider. For more information on the SDK
see [Download .NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0). In this example we
will be creating a simple feedback provider and will also register with the command predictor
interface to give the feedback to the predictive experience. You can read more about predictors in
[Using predictors in PSReadLine](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/learn/shell/using-predictors),
and [How to create a command line predictor](./create-command-line-predictor.md).

First, you will need to create a new .NET class library project. You can do this by running the
following in the project directory:

```powershell

dotnet new classlib --name MyFeedbackProvider
```

You will need to add an `ItemGroup`` to include the `System.Management.Automation` package to your
.csproj file. Your .csproj file should look like the following:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="System.Management.Automation" Version="7.4.0-preview.3">
        <ExcludeAssets>contentFiles</ExcludeAssets>
        <PrivateAssets>All</PrivateAssets>
    </PackageReference>
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

> [!NOTE] 
> Since we are still in preview you may need to change the version of the
> System.Management.Automation to a greater package version. The minimum verison is 7.4.0-preview.3.


You can delete the default `Class.cs` file that is created with the project. You will need to add a
new class file to the project. You can name this file whatever you want. For this example we will
name it `MyFeedbackProvider.cs`.

```csharp
TODO ADD CODE 
```

### Breaking down the code

There is a lot going on in the code above, lets break it down and explain what each part is doing.

You are going to first need and `Init` class that inherits from the `IModuleAssemblyInitializer` and
`IModuleAssemblyCleanup` interfaces. This will allow you to register and unregister your feedback
provider with the subsystem manager. `OnImport` runs when the binary module is registered with the
subsystem and `OnRemove` runs when the binary module is unregistered from the subsystem.

```csharp
public class Init : IModuleAssemblyInitializer, IModuleAssemblyCleanup
{
    private const string Id = "<ADD YOUR GUID HERE>";

    public void OnImport()
    {
        var feedback = new myFeedbackProvider(Id);
        SubsystemManager.RegisterSubsystem(SubsystemKind.FeedbackProvider, feedback);
        SubsystemManager.RegisterSubsystem(SubsystemKind.CommandPredictor, feedback);
    }

    public void OnRemove(PSModuleInfo psModuleInfo)
    {
        SubsystemManager.UnregisterSubsystem<ICommandPredictor>(new Guid(Id));
        SubsystemManager.UnregisterSubsystem<IFeedbackProvider>(new Guid(Id));
    }
}
```

You will need to replace `<ADD YOUR GUID HERE>` with a unique GUID. You can generate a GUID by
running the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Guid
```

This is required to maintain a unique identifier for your feedback provider. It is passed to the
constructor of the `myFeedbackProvider` class. Above the init code, add your main feedback provider class. This inherits from the `IFeedbackProvider` and `ICommandPredictor` interface. 

```csharp
namespace myFeedbackProvider;

public sealed class myFeedbackProvider : IFeedbackProvider, ICommandPredictor{
    // more code to go here.
}
```

That constructor will only need to assign the passed GUID to a private variable that can be seen
here:

```csharp 
private readonly Guid _guid;
public Guid Id => _guid;

// Constructor
internal myFeedbackProvider(string guid)
{
    _guid = new Guid(guid);
}
```

You will need to implement a number of required methods and variables in your feedback provider
class. Most of these are self explanatory, `_candidates` is a list of strings that will be passed to
the predictor interface later in this tutorial to enhance the feedback provider experience.Ã¥

```csharp
public FeedbackTrigger Trigger => FeedbackTrigger.All;

Dictionary<string, string>? ISubsystem.FunctionsToDefine => null;

// Descriptive values of the feedback provider
public string Name => "myFeedbackProvider"; // is the display name when triggered
public string Description => "This is very simple feedback provider";

// List of candidates from the feedback provider to be passed as predictor results
private List<string>? _candidates;
```

Now you are ready to implement the main `GetFeedback` method that will be the main trigger for
feedback.

```csharp
 public FeedbackItem? GetFeedback(FeedbackContext context, CancellationToken token)
    {

        var target = context.Trigger;
        var commandLine = context.CommandLine;

        // defining the header and footer variables
        string header;
        string footer;

        List<string>? actions = new List<string>();

        
        // TRIGGERS WILL GO HERE

        return null;
    }
```


## Using a feedback provider

Feedback providers will trigger after the defined action has taken place. So if you have designed
your feedback provider to trigger on a success and after a certain command, you will have to have
the module imported and then run the command to verify it is working.

We suggest importing feedback providers in your `$PROFILE` so that they are always available. You
can edit your `$PROFILE` by opening it in any text editor or if you have Visual Studio Code
installed you can run the following command:

```powershell
code $PROFILE
```

You can get a list of installed feedback providers, using the following command:

```powershell
Get-PSSubsystem -Kind FeedbackProvider
```

```Output
Kind              SubsystemType      IsRegistered Implementations
----              -------------      ------------ ---------------
FeedbackProvider  IFeedbackProvider          True {general}
```

> [!NOTE]
> `Get-PSSubsystem` is an experimental cmdlet that was introduced in PowerShell 7.1 You must enable
> the `PSSubsystemPluginModel` experimental feature to use this cmdlet. For more information, see
> [Using Experimental Features](../learn/experimental-features.md#pssubsystempluginmodel).

## Enhancing feedback provider experience

Another way to enhance users experience with your feedback provider is to make it utilize the
ICommandPredictor interface so the feedback can be given to the users predictor experience. You can
read more about creating a command line predictor in the
[How to create a command line predictor](./create-command-line-predictor.md) article. 

You can add this functionality to your feedback provider by adding the following code to your class
to get predictor behavior for your feedback provider.

```csharp
#region ICommandPredictor


// Gets a value indicating whether the predictor accepts a specific kind of feedback.
// client - Represents the client that initiates the call.
// feedback - the specific kind of feedback 
public bool CanAcceptFeedback(PredictionClient client, PredictorFeedbackKind feedback)
{
    return feedback switch
    {
        PredictorFeedbackKind.CommandLineAccepted => true,
        _ => false,
    };
}

// Get the predictive suggestions. It indicates the start of a suggestion rendering session.
// client - Represents the client that initiates the call. 
// context - The PredictionContext object to be used for prediction.
// cancellationToken - The cancellation token to cancel the prediction.
public SuggestionPackage GetSuggestion(PredictionClient client, PredictionContext context, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    if (_candidates is not null)
    {
        string input = context.InputAst.Extent.Text;
        List<PredictiveSuggestion>? result = null;

        foreach (string c in _candidates)
        {
            if (c.StartsWith(input, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
            {
                result ??= new List<PredictiveSuggestion>(_candidates.Count);
                result.Add(new PredictiveSuggestion(c));
            }
        }

        if (result is not null)
        {
            return new SuggestionPackage(result);
        }
    }

    return default;
}

// A command line was accepted to execute. The predictor can start processing early as needed with the latest history.
public void OnCommandLineAccepted(PredictionClient client, IReadOnlyList<string> history)
{
    // Reset the candidate state once the command is accepted.
    _candidates = null;
}

public void OnSuggestionDisplayed(PredictionClient client, uint session, int countOrIndex) { }

public void OnSuggestionAccepted(PredictionClient client, uint session, string acceptedSuggestion) { }

public void OnCommandLineExecuted(PredictionClient client, string commandLine, bool success) { }

#endregion;
