examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Copy a file to the specified directory'
  code: |-
    Copy-Item "C:\Wabash\Logfiles\mar1604.log.txt" -Destination "C:\Presentation"
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example copies the `mar1604.log.txt` file to the `C:\Presentation` directory. The original file
    isn't deleted.

- title: 'Example 2: Copy directory contents to an existing directory'
  code: |-
    Copy-Item -Path "C:\Logfiles\*" -Destination "C:\Drawings" -Recurse
  description: |-
    > [!NOTE]
    > If the path `C:\Drawings` doesn't exist the cmdlet copies all the files from the `Logfiles`
    > folder into a single file `C:\Drawings`.
  summary: |+
    This example copies the contents of the `C:\Logfiles` directory into the existing `C:\Drawings`
    directory. The `Logfiles` directory isn't copied.

    If the `Logfiles` directory has files in subdirectories, those subdirectories are copied with their
    file trees intact. By default, the **Container** parameter is set to **True**, which preserves the
    directory structure.

- title: 'Example 3: Copy directory and contents to a new directory'
  code: |-
    Copy-Item -Path "C:\Logfiles" -Destination "C:\Drawings\Logs" -Recurse
  description: |-
    > [!NOTE]
    > If the **Path** includes `\*`, all the directory's file contents, including the subdirectory
    > trees, are copied to the new destination directory. For example:
    >
    > `Copy-Item -Path "C:\Logfiles\*" -Destination "C:\Drawings\Logs" -Recurse`
  summary: |+
    This example copies the contents of the `C:\Logfiles` source directory and creates a new destination
    directory. The new destination directory, `\Logs` is created in `C:\Drawings`.

    To include the source directory's name, copy to an existing destination directory as shown in
    **Example 2**. Or, name the new destination directory with the same as the source directory.

- title: 'Example 4: Copy a file to the specified directory and rename the file'
  code: |-
    Copy-Item "\\Server01\Share\Get-Widget.ps1" -Destination "\\Server12\ScriptArchive\Get-Widget.ps1.txt"
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example uses the `Copy-Item` cmdlet to copy the `Get-Widget.ps1` script from the
    `\\Server01\Share` directory to the `\\Server12\ScriptArchive` directory. As part of the copy
    operation, the command changes the item name from `Get-Widget.ps1` to `Get-Widget.ps1.txt`, so it
    can be safely attached to email messages.

- title: 'Example 5: Copy a file to a remote computer'
  code: |-
    $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Server01" -Credential "Contoso\User01"
    Copy-Item "D:\Folder001\test.log" -Destination "C:\Folder001_Copy\" -ToSession $Session
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    A session is created to the remote computer named **Server01** with the credential of
    `Contoso\User01` and stores the results in the variable named `$Session`.

    The `Copy-Item` cmdlet copies `test.log` from the `D:\Folder001` folder to the `C:\Folder001_Copy`
    folder on the remote computer using the session information stored in the `$Session` variable. The
    original file isn't deleted.

- title: 'Example 6: Copy a folder to a remote computer'
  code: |-
    $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Server02" -Credential "Contoso\User01"
    Copy-Item "D:\Folder002\" -Destination "C:\Folder002_Copy\" -ToSession $Session
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    A session is created to the remote computer named **Server01** with the credential of
    `Contoso\User01` and stores the results in the variable named `$Session`.

    The `Copy-Item` cmdlet copies the `D:\Folder002` folder to the `C:\Folder002_Copy` directory on the
    remote computer using the session information stored in the `$Session` variable. Any subfolders or
    files aren't copied without using the **Recurse** switch. The operation creates the `Folder002_Copy`
    folder if it doesn't already exist.

- title: 'Example 7: Recursively copy the entire contents of a folder to a remote computer'
  code: |-
    $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Server04" -Credential "Contoso\User01"
    Copy-Item "D:\Folder003\" -Destination "C:\Folder003_Copy\" -ToSession $Session -Recurse
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    A session is created to the remote computer named **Server01** with the credential of
    `Contoso\User01` and stores the results in the variable named `$Session`.

    The `Copy-Item` cmdlet copies the entire contents from the `D:\Folder003` folder to the
    `C:\Folder003_Copy` directory on the remote computer using the session information stored in the
    `$Session` variable. The subfolders are copied with their file trees intact. The operation creates
    the `Folder003_Copy` folder if it doesn't already exist.

- title: 'Example 8: Copy a file to a remote computer and then rename the file'
  code: |-
    $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Server04" -Credential "Contoso\User01"
    Copy-Item "D:\Folder004\scriptingexample.ps1" -Destination "C:\Folder004_Copy\scriptingexample_copy.ps1" -ToSession $Session
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    A session is created to the remote computer named **Server01** with the credential of
    `Contoso\User01` and stores the results in the variable named `$Session`.

    The `Copy-Item` cmdlet copies `scriptingexample.ps1` from the `D:\Folder004` folder to the
    `C:\Folder004_Copy` folder on the remote computer using the session information stored in the
    `$Session` variable. The original file isn't deleted.

- title: 'Example 9: Copy a remote file to the local computer'
  code: |-
    $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Server01" -Credential "Contoso\User01"
    Copy-Item "C:\MyRemoteData\test.log" -Destination "D:\MyLocalData\" -FromSession $Session
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    A session is created to the remote computer named **Server01** with the credential of
    `Contoso\User01` and stores the results in the variable named `$Session`.

    The `Copy-Item` cmdlet copies `test.log` from the remote `C:\MyRemoteData\` to the local
    `D:\MyLocalData` folder using the session information stored in the `$Session` variable. The
    original file isn't deleted.

- title: 'Example 10: Copy the entire contents of a remote folder to the local computer'
  code: |-
    $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Server01" -Credential "Contoso\User01"
    Copy-Item "C:\MyRemoteData\scripts" -Destination "D:\MyLocalData\" -FromSession $Session
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    A session is created to the remote computer named **Server01** with the credential of
    `Contoso\User01` and stores the results in the variable named `$Session`.

    The `Copy-Item` cmdlet copies the entire contents from the remote `C:\MyRemoteData\scripts` folder
    to the local `D:\MyLocalData` folder using the session information stored in the `$Session`
    variable. If the scripts folder has files in subfolders, those subfolders are copied with their
    file trees intact.

- title: 'Example 11: Recursively copy the entire contents of a remote folder to the local computer'
  code: |-
    $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Server01" -Credential "Contoso\User01"
    Copy-Item "C:\MyRemoteData\scripts" -Destination "D:\MyLocalData\scripts" -FromSession $Session -Recurse
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    A session is created to the remote computer named **Server01** with the credential of
    `Contoso\User01` and stores the results in the variable named `$Session`.

    The `Copy-Item` cmdlet copies the entire contents from the remote `C:\MyRemoteData\scripts` folder
    to the local `D:\MyLocalData\scripts` folder using the session information stored in the `$Session`
    variable. Because the **Recurse** parameter is used, the operation creates the scripts folder if it
    doesn't already exist. If the scripts folder has files in subfolders, those subfolders are
    copied with their file trees intact.

- title: 'Example 12: Recursively copy files from a folder tree into the current folder'
  code: |-
    PS C:\temp\test> (Get-ChildItem C:\temp\tree -Recurse).FullName
    C:\temp\tree\subfolder
    C:\temp\tree\file1.txt
    C:\temp\tree\file2.txt
    C:\temp\tree\file3.txt
    C:\temp\tree\subfolder\file3.txt
    C:\temp\tree\subfolder\file4.txt
    C:\temp\tree\subfolder\file5.txt

    PS C:\temp\test> Get-Content C:\temp\tree\file3.txt
    This is file3.txt in the root folder

    PS C:\temp\test> Get-Content C:\temp\tree\subfolder\file3.txt
    This is file3.txt in the subfolder

    PS C:\temp\test> Copy-Item -Path C:\temp\tree -Filter *.txt -Recurse -Container:$false
    PS C:\temp\test> (Get-ChildItem . -Recurse).FullName
    C:\temp\test\subfolder
    C:\temp\test\file1.txt
    C:\temp\test\file2.txt
    C:\temp\test\file3.txt
    C:\temp\test\file4.txt
    C:\temp\test\file5.txt

    PS C:\temp\test> Get-Content .\file3.txt
    This is file3.txt in the subfolder
  description: |-
    The `Copy-Item` cmdlet has the **Container** parameter set to `$false`. This causes the contents of
    the source folder to be copied but doesn't preserve the folder structure. Notice that files with
    the same name are overwritten in the destination folder.
  summary: |+
    This example shows how to copy files from a multilevel folder structure into a single flat folder.
    The first three commands show the existing folder structure and the contents of two files, both
    names `file3.txt`.

- title: 'Example 13: Using filters to copy items without recursion'
  code: |-
    PS D:\temp\test\out> Copy-Item -Path D:\temp\tree\* -Include ex*
    PS D:\temp\test\out> (Get-ChildItem -Recurse).FullName
    D:\temp\out\examples
    D:\temp\out\example.ps1
    D:\temp\out\example.txt
  description: |-
    The **Include** parameter is applied to the contents of `D:\temp\tree` folder to copy all items that
    match `ex*`. Notice that, without recursion, the `D:\temp\out\examples` folder is copied, but none
    of its contents are copied.
  summary: |+
    This example shows the results using the **Include** parameter to select the items to be copied.

    This example uses the following folder structure containing the files to be copied:

    - `D:\temp\tree\example.ps1`
    - `D:\temp\tree\example.txt`
    - `D:\temp\tree\examples\`
    - `D:\temp\tree\examples\example_1.txt`
    - `D:\temp\tree\examples\example_2.txt`
    - `D:\temp\tree\examples\subfolder\`
    - `D:\temp\tree\examples\subfolder\test.txt`

    In this example, `Copy-Item` is called with a wildcard for both the **Path** and **Include**
    parameters. Specifying a wildcard for the **Path** parameter ensures that it processes all files and
    folders that match `D:\temp\tree\*`. The **Include** parameter filters the list of items to process,
    limiting the operation to only those paths that begin with `ex`.

- title: 'Example 14: Using filters to copy items with recursion'
  code: |-
    D:\temp\out> Copy-Item -Path D:\temp\tree\* -Include ex* -Recurse
    D:\temp\out> (Get-ChildItem -Recurse).FullName
    D:\temp\out\examples
    D:\temp\out\example.ps1
    D:\temp\out\example.txt
    D:\temp\out\examples\subfolder
    D:\temp\out\examples\example_1.txt
    D:\temp\out\examples\example_2.txt
    D:\temp\out\examples\subfolder\test.txt
  description: |-
    The **Include** parameter is applied to the contents of `D:\temp\tree` folder to copy all items that
    match `ex*`. Notice that, with recursion, the `D:\temp\out\examples` folder is copied along with all
    the files and subfolders. The copy includes files that _do not_ match the include filter. When using
    `Copy-Item`, the filters only apply to the top-level specified by the **Path** parameter. Then
    recursion is applied to those matching items.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The behavior of the **Exclude** parameter is the same as described in this example, except that
    > it limits the operation to only those paths that don't match the pattern.
  summary: |+
    This example shows the results using the **Include** parameter to select the items to be copied.

    This example uses the following folder structure containing the files to be copied:

    - `D:\temp\tree\example.ps1`
    - `D:\temp\tree\example.txt`
    - `D:\temp\tree\examples\`
    - `D:\temp\tree\examples\example_1.txt`
    - `D:\temp\tree\examples\example_2.txt`
    - `D:\temp\tree\examples\subfolder\`
    - `D:\temp\tree\examples\subfolder\test.txt`

    In this example, `Copy-Item` is called with a wildcard for both the **Path** and **Include**
    parameters. Specifying a wildcard for the **Path** parameter ensures that it processes all the files
    and folders that match `D:\temp\tree\*`. The **Include** parameter filters the list of items to
    process, limiting the operation to only those paths that begin with `ex`.

- title: 'Example 15: Limit the files to recursively copy from a wildcard-specified path'
  code: |-
    D:\temp\out> Get-ChildItem -Path D:\temp\tree -Recurse -Filter ex* | Copy-Item
    D:\temp\out> (Get-ChildItem -Recurse).FullName
    D:\temp\out\examples
    D:\temp\out\example_1.txt
    D:\temp\out\example_2.txt
    D:\temp\out\example.ps1
    D:\temp\out\example.txt
  description: |-
    Unlike the `Copy-Item`, the **Filter** parameter for `Get-ChildItem` applies to the items discovered
    during recursion. This enables you to find, filter, and then copy items recursively.
  summary: |+
    This example shows how to limit the files recursively copied from a wildcard-matching path into
    another folder. Example 13 shows that, because the **Include** parameter only filters on the paths
    resolved for a wildcard-specifying **Path**, the **Include** parameter can't be used to limit the
    files recursively copied from a folder. Instead, you can use `Get-ChildItem` to find the items you
    want to copy and pass those items to `Copy-Item`.

    This example uses the following folder structure containing the files to be copied:

    - `D:\temp\tree\example.ps1`
    - `D:\temp\tree\example.txt`
    - `D:\temp\tree\examples\`
    - `D:\temp\tree\examples\example_1.txt`
    - `D:\temp\tree\examples\example_2.txt`
    - `D:\temp\tree\examples\subfolder\`
    - `D:\temp\tree\examples\subfolder\test.txt`

    To copy all items that begin with `ex*`, use `Get-ChildItem` with the **Recurse** and **Filter**
    parameters and pipe the results to `Copy-Item`.

    parameter, not the final results. This parameter is only effective when the **Path** is specified
    with one or more wildcards. Since this parameter only filters on the paths resolved for the **Path**
    parameter, it doesn't filter any items discovered when recursing through child folders with the

    Specifies a filter to qualify the **Path** parameter. The
    [FileSystem](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_FileSystem_Provider.md) provider is the only
    installed PowerShell provider that supports the use of filters. You can find the syntax for the
    **FileSystem** filter language in
    [about_Wildcards](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Wildcards.md). Filters are more efficient
    than other parameters, because the provider applies them when the cmdlet gets the objects rather
    than having PowerShell filter the objects after they're retrieved.

description: |-
  The `Copy-Item` cmdlet copies an item from one location to another location in the same namespace.
  For instance, it can copy a file to a folder, but it can't copy a file to a certificate drive.

  This cmdlet doesn't cut or delete the items being copied. The particular items that the cmdlet can
  copy depend on the PowerShell provider that exposes the item. For instance, it can copy files and
  directories in a file system drive and registry keys and entries in the registry drive.

  This cmdlet can copy and rename items in the same command. To rename an item, enter the new name in
  the value of the **Destination** parameter. To rename an item and not copy it, use the `Rename-Item`
  cmdlet.
