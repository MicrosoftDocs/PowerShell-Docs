# about_Arithmetic_Operators

## Short description
Describes the operators that perform arithmetic in PowerShell.

## Long description

Arithmetic operators calculate numeric values. You can use one or more
arithmetic operators to add, subtract, multiply, and divide values, and to
calculate the remainder (modulus) of a division operation.

The addition operator (`+`) and multiplication operator (`*`) also operate on
strings, arrays, and hashtables. The addition operator concatenates the input.
The multiplication operator returns multiple copies of the input. You can even
mix object types in an arithmetic statement. The method that's used to evaluate
the statement is determined by the type of the leftmost object in the
expression.

Beginning in PowerShell 2.0, all arithmetic operators work on 64-bit numbers.

Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, the `-shr` (shift-right) and `-shl` (shift-left)
are added to support bitwise arithmetic in PowerShell. The bitwise operators
only work on integer types.

PowerShell supports the following arithmetic operators:

- Addition (`+`) - Adds numbers, concatenates strings, arrays, and hash tables

  ```powershell
  6 + 2                        # result = 8
  "file" + "name"              # result = "filename"
  @(1, "one") + @(2.0, "two")  # result = @(1, "one", 2.0, "two")
  @{"one" = 1} + @{"two" = 2}  # result = @{"one" = 1; "two" = 2}
  ```

- Subtraction (`-`) - Subtracts or negates numbers

  ```powershell
  6 - 2   # result = 4
  - -6    # result = 6
  (Get-Date).AddDays(-1) # Yesterday's date
  ```

- Multiplication (`*`) - Multiply numbers or copy strings and arrays the
  specified number of times

  ```powershell
  6 * 2       # result = 12
  @("!") * 4  # result = @("!","!","!","!")
  "!" * 3     # result = "!!!"
  ```

- Division (`/`) - Divides numbers

  ```powershell
  6 / 2  # result = 3
  ```

- Modulus (`%`) - returns the remainder of a division operation.

  ```powershell
  7 % 2  # result = 1
  ```

- Bitwise AND (`-band`)

  ```powershell
  5 -band 3  # result = 1
  ```

- Bitwise NOT (`-bnot`)

  ```powershell
  -bnot 5  # result = -6
  ```

- Bitwise OR (`-bor`)

  ```powershell
  5 -bor 0x03  # result = 7
  ```

- Bitwise XOR (`-bxor`)

  ```powershell
  5 -bxor 3   # result = 6
  ```

- Shifts bits to the left (`-shl`)

  ```powershell
  102 -shl 2  # result = 408
  ```

- Shifts bits to the right (`-shr`)

  ```powershell
  102 -shr 2  # result = 25
  ```

## Operator precedence

PowerShell processes arithmetic operators in the following order:

| Precedence |     Operator     |               Description               |
| ---------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1          | `()`             | Parentheses                             |
| 2          | `-`              | For a negative number or unary operator |
| 3          | `*`, `/`, `%`    | For multiplication and division         |
| 4          | `+`, `-`         | For addition and subtraction            |
| 5          | `-band`, `-bnot` | For bitwise operations                  |
| 5          | `-bor`, `-bxor`  | For bitwise operations                  |
| 5          | `-shr`, `-shl`   | For bitwise operations                  |

PowerShell processes the expressions from left to right according to the
precedence rules. The following examples show the effect of the precedence
rules:

```powershell
3+6/3*4    # result = 11
3+6/(3*4)  # result = 3.5
(3+6)/3*4  # result = 12
```

The order in which PowerShell evaluates expressions might differ from other
programming and scripting languages that you have used. The following example
shows a complicated assignment statement.

```powershell
$a = 0
$b = @(1,2)
$c = @(-1,-2)

$b[$a] = $c[$a++]
```

In this example, the expression `$a++` is evaluated before `$b[$a]`. Evaluating
`$a++` changes the value of `$a` after it's used in the statement `$c[$a++]`,
but before it's used in `$b[$a]`. The variable `$a` in `$b[$a]` equals `1`, not
`0`. Therefore, the statement assigns a value to `$b[1]`, not `$b[0]`.

The code above is equivalent to:

```powershell
$a = 0
$b = @(1,2)
$c = @(-1,-2)

$tmp = $c[$a]
$a = $a + 1
$b[$a] = $tmp
```

## Division and rounding

When the quotient of a division operation is an integer, PowerShell rounds the
value to the nearest integer. When the value is `.5`, it rounds to the nearest
even integer.

The following example shows the effect of rounding to the nearest even integer.

```powershell
PS> [int]( 5 / 2 )  # Result is rounded down
2

PS> [int]( 7 / 2 )  # Result is rounded up
4
```

You can use the `[Math]` class to get different rounding behavior.

```powershell
PS> [int][Math]::Round(5 / 2,[MidpointRounding]::AwayFromZero)
3

PS> [int][Math]::Ceiling(5 / 2)
3

PS> [int][Math]::Floor(5 / 2)
2
```

For more information, see the [Math.Round](/dotnet/api/system.math.round)
method.

## Type conversion to accommodate result

PowerShell automatically selects the .NET numeric type that best expresses the
result without losing precision. For example:

```powershell
2 + 3.1
(2).GetType().FullName
(2 + 3.1).GetType().FullName
```

```output
5.1
System.Int32
System.Double
```

If the result of an operation is too large for the type, the type of the result
is widened to accommodate the result, as in the following example:

```powershell
(512MB).GetType().FullName
(512MB * 512MB).GetType().FullName
```

```output
System.Int32
System.Double
```

The type of the result isn't always the same as one of the operands. In the
following example, the negative value can't be cast to an unsigned integer, and
the unsigned integer is too large to be cast to `Int32`:

```powershell
([int32]::minvalue + [uint32]::maxvalue).gettype().fullname
```

```output
System.Int64
```

In this example, `Int64` can accommodate both types.

The `System.Decimal` type is an exception. If either operand has the
**Decimal** type, the result is **Decimal** type. Any result too large for the
**Decimal** value is an error.

```powershell
PS> [Decimal]::maxvalue
79228162514264337593543950335

PS> [Decimal]::maxvalue + 1
RuntimeException: Value was either too large or too small for a Decimal.
```

### Potential loss of precision

Anytime you have a result that exceeds the range of the type, you risk losing
precision due to type conversion. For example, adding a sufficiently large
`[long]` and `[int]` results in the operands being converted to `[double]`. In
this example, `9223372036854775807` is the maximum value of a `[long]` integer.
Adding to value overflows the range of `[long]`.

```powershell
PS> (9223372036854775807 + 2).GetType().FullName
System.Double
```

Casting the result to `[ulong]` yields an inaccurate result, because the
operands were coerced to `[double]` first.

```powershell
PS> [ulong](9223372036854775807 + 2)
9223372036854775808
```

Defining the larger value as `[ulong]` first avoids the problem and produces the
correct result.

```powershell
PS> 9223372036854775807ul + 2
9223372036854775809
```

However, exceeding the range of `[ulong]` results in a `[double]`.

```powershell
PS> ([ulong]::MaxValue + 1).GetType().FullName
System.Double
```

### Bigint arithmetic

When you perform arithmetic operations on `[bigint]` numbers, PowerShell uses
converts all operands to `[bigint]`, which results in truncation of non-integer
values. For example, the `[double]` value `1.9` is truncated to `1` when
converted to `[bigint]`.

```powershell
PS> [bigint]1 / 1.9
1
PS> 1 / [bigint]1.9
1
```

This behavior is different from the behavior of other numeric types. In this
example, an `[int]` divided by a `[double]` results in a `[double]`. Casting
`1.9` to an `[int]` rounds the value up to `2`.

```powershell
PS> 1 / 1.9
0.526315789473684
PS> 1 / [int]1.9
0.5
```

## Adding and multiplying non numeric types

You can add numbers, strings, arrays, and hash tables. And, you can multiply
numbers, strings, and arrays. However, you can't multiply hash tables.

When you add strings, arrays, or hash tables, the elements are concatenated.
When you concatenate collections, such as arrays or hash tables, a new object
is created that contains the objects from both collections. If you try to
concatenate hash tables that have the same key, the operation fails.

For example, the following commands create two arrays and then add them:

```powershell
$a = 1,2,3
$b = "A","B","C"
$a + $b
```

```output
1
2
3
A
B
C
```

You can also perform arithmetic operations on objects of different types. The
operation that PowerShell performs is determined by the Microsoft .NET type of
the leftmost object in the operation. PowerShell tries to convert all the
objects in the operation to the .NET type of the first object. If it succeeds
in converting the objects, it performs the operation appropriate to the .NET
type of the first object. If it fails to convert any of the objects, the
operation fails.

The following examples demonstrate the use of the addition and multiplication
operators in operations that include different object types.

```powershell
$array = 1,2,3
$red = [ConsoleColor]::Red
$blue = [ConsoleColor]::Blue

"file" + 16      # result = "file16"
$array + 16      # result = 1,2,3,16
$array + "file"  # result = 1,2,3,"file"
$array * 2       # result = 1,2,3,1,2,3
"file" * 3       # result = "filefilefile"
$blue + 3        # result = Red
$red - 3         # result = Blue
$blue - $red     # result = -3
+ '123'          # result = 123
```

Because the method that's used to evaluate statements is determined by the
leftmost object, addition and multiplication in PowerShell aren't strictly
commutative. For example, `(a + b)` doesn't always equal `(b + a)`, and `(ab)`
doesn't always equal `(ba)`.

The following examples demonstrate this principle:

```powershell
PS> "file" + 16
file16

PS> 16 + "file"
InvalidArgument: can't convert value "file" to type "System.Int32". Error:
"Input string wasn't in a correct format."
```

Hash tables are a slightly different case. You can add hash tables to another
hash table, as long as, the added hash tables don't have duplicate keys.

The following example show how to add hash tables to each other.

```powershell
$hash1 = @{a=1; b=2; c=3}
$hash2 = @{c1="Server01"; c2="Server02"}
$hash1 + $hash2
```

```output
Name                           Value
----                           -----
c2                             Server02
a                              1
b                              2
c1                             Server01
c                              3
```

The following example throws an error because one of the keys is duplicated in
both hash tables.

```powershell
$hash1 = @{a=1; b=2; c=3}
$hash2 = @{c1="Server01"; c="Server02"}
$hash1 + $hash2
```

```output
OperationStopped:
Line |
   3 |  $hash1 + $hash2
     |  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     | Item has already been added. Key in dictionary: 'c'  Key being added: 'c'
```

Also, you can add a hash table to an array; and, the entire hash table becomes
an item in the array.

```powershell
$array1 = @(0, "Hello World", [datetime]::Now)
$hash1 = @{a=1; b=2}
$array2 = $array1 + $hash1
$array2
```

```output
0
Hello World

Monday, June 12, 2017 3:05:46 PM

Key   : a
Value : 1
Name  : a

Key   : b
Value : 2
Name  : b
```

However, you can't add any other type to a hash table.

```powershell
$hash1 + 2
```

```output
InvalidOperation: A hash table can only be added to another hash table.
```

Although the addition operators are very useful, use the assignment operators
to add elements to hash tables and arrays. For more information see
[about_assignment_operators](about_Assignment_Operators.md). The following
examples use the `+=` assignment operator to add items to an array:

```powershell
$array = @()
(0..2).foreach{ $array += $_ }
$array
```

```output
0
1
2
```

## Arithmetic operators and variables

You can also use arithmetic operators with variables. The operators act on the
values of the variables. The following examples demonstrate the use of
arithmetic operators with variables:

```powershell
PS> $intA = 6
PS> $intB = 4
PS> $intA + $intB
10

PS> $a = "Power"
PS> $b = "Shell"
PS> $a + $b
PowerShell
```

## Arithmetic operators and commands

Typically, you use the arithmetic operators in expressions with numbers,
strings, and arrays. However, you can also use arithmetic operators with the
objects that commands return and with the properties of those objects.

The following examples show how to use the arithmetic operators in expressions
with PowerShell commands:

```powershell
(Get-Date) + (New-TimeSpan -day 1)
```

The parenthesis operator forces the evaluation of the `Get-Date` cmdlet and the
evaluation of the `New-TimeSpan -Day 1` cmdlet expression, in that order. Both
results are then added using the `+` operator.

```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object { ($_.ws * 2) -gt 50mb }
```

```output
Handles  NPM(K)    PM(K)      WS(K) VM(M)   CPU(s)     Id ProcessName
-------  ------    -----      ----- -----   ------     -- -----------
   1896      39    50968      30620   264 1,572.55   1104 explorer
  12802      78   188468      81032   753 3,676.39   5676 OUTLOOK
    660       9    36168      26956   143    12.20    988 PowerShell
    561      14     6592      28144   110 1,010.09    496 services
   3476      80    34664      26092   234 ...45.69    876 svchost
    967      30    58804      59496   416   930.97   2508 WINWORD
```

In the above expression, each process working space (`$_.ws`) is multiplied by
`2`; and, the result, compared against `50mb` to see if it's greater than that.

## Bitwise operators

PowerShell supports the standard bitwise operators, including bitwise-AND
(`-band`), the inclusive and exclusive bitwise-OR operators (`-bor` and
`-bxor`), and bitwise-NOT (`-bnot`).

Beginning in PowerShell 2.0, all bitwise operators work with 64-bit integers.

Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, the `-shr` (shift-right) and `-shl` (shift-left)
are introduced to support bitwise arithmetic in PowerShell.

PowerShell supports the following bitwise operators.

| Operator | Description            | Expression   | Result |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| `-band`  | Bitwise AND            | `10 -band 3` | 2      |
| `-bor`   | Bitwise OR (inclusive) | `10 -bor 3`  | 11     |
| `-bxor`  | Bitwise OR (exclusive) | `10 -bxor 3` | 9      |
| `-bnot`  | Bitwise NOT            | `-bNot 10`   | -11    |
| `-shl`   | Shift-left             | `102 -shl 2` | 408    |
| `-shr`   | Shift-right            | `102 -shr 1` | 51     |

Bitwise operators act on the binary format of a value. For example, the bit
structure for the number 10 is 00001010 (based on 1 byte), and the bit
structure for the number 3 is 00000011. When you use a bitwise operator to
compare 10 to 3, the individual bits in each byte are compared.

In a bitwise AND operation, the resulting bit's set to 1 only when both input
bits are 1.

```
1010      (10)
0011      ( 3)
--------------  bAND
0010      ( 2)
```

In a bitwise OR (inclusive) operation, the resulting bit's set to 1 when either
or both input bits are 1. The resulting bit's set to 0 only when both input
bits are set to 0.

```
1010      (10)
0011      ( 3)
--------------  bOR (inclusive)
1011      (11)
```

In a bitwise OR (exclusive) operation, the resulting bit's set to 1 only when
one input bit's 1.

```
1010      (10)
0011      ( 3)
--------------  bXOR (exclusive)
1001      ( 9)
```

The bitwise NOT operator is a unary operator that produces the binary
complement of the value. A bit of 1 is set to 0 and a bit of 0 is set to 1.

For example, the binary complement of 0 is -1, the maximum unsigned integer
(0xFFFFFFFF), and the binary complement of -1 is 0.

```powershell
-bNot 10
```

```Output
-11
```

```
0000 0000 0000 1010  (10)
------------------------- bNOT
1111 1111 1111 0101  (-11, 0xFFFFFFF5)
```

In a bitwise shift-left operation, all bits are moved "n" places to the left,
where "n" is the value of the right operand. A zero is inserted in the ones
place.

| Expression  | Result | Binary Result |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------- |
| `21 -shl 0` | 21     | 0001 0101     |
| `21 -shl 1` | 42     | 0010 1010     |
| `21 -shl 2` | 84     | 0101 0100     |

In a bitwise shift-right operation, all bits are moved "n" places to the right,
where "n" is specified by the right operand. The shift-right operator (`-shr`)
copies the sign bit to the left-most place when shifting a signed value. For
unsigned values, a zero is inserted in the left-most position.

|        Expression        |   Result    |              Binary              |    Hex     |
| :----------------------: | ----------: | -------------------------------: | ---------: |
|       `21 -shr 0`        |          21 |                         00010101 |       0x15 |
|       `21 -shr 1`        |          10 |                         00001010 |       0x0A |
