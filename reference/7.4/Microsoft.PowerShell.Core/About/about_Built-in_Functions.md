## Short description

Describes the built-in functions in PowerShell.

## Long description

PowerShell includes a set of functions that are loaded into every PowerShell
session. These functions are similar to cmdlets but they are not included in
any module. They are defined in the PowerShell engine itself.

These functions are provided as shorthand helpers for common tasks. In many
cases, these functions call an existing cmdlet with an additional parameter.

## `cd..`

In the Windows CMD shell it is common to run the `cd` command without any spaces
between the command and the destination path. This function runs
`Set-Location ..` to change to the parent folder.

## `cd\`

In the Windows CMD shell it is common to run the `cd` command without any spaces
between the command and the destination path. This function runs
`Set-Location \` to change to the root folder.

## `Pause`

This function replicates the behavior of CMD's `pause` command. The script
pauses execution and prompts the user to hit a key to continue.

## `help`

This function invokes `Get-Help` with your parameters and passes the output to
the systems pager command. On Windows systems, the pager is `more.com`. On
non-Windows systems the pager could be `more` or `less`.

## `prompt`

This is the function that creates the default prompt for the PowerShell command
line. You can customize your prompt by overriding this function with your own.
For more information see [about_Prompts](about_Prompts.md).

## `Clear-Host`

This function clears the screen. For more information, see
[Clear-Host](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Core.Clear-Host).

## `TabExpansion2`

This is the default function to use for tab expansion.

## `oss`

This function provides a short hand way to run `Out-String -Stream` in a
pipeline.

## `mkdir`

This function provides a short hand way to run `New-Item -Type Directory` with
your parameters. This function is only defined for Windows systems. Linux and
macOS system use the native `mkdir` command.

## Windows drive letter functions

In Windows, drive mount points are associated with a drive letter like `C:`.
You can switch to the current location on another drive just by entering that
drive letter on the command line.

PowerShell create a function for every possible drive letter, `A:` through `Z:`.

These functions are not defined for non-Windows systems.
