## Short description
PowerShell logs internal operations from the engine, providers, and cmdlets.

## Long description

PowerShell logs details of PowerShell operations, such as starting and stopping
the engine and starting and stopping providers. It also logs details about
PowerShell commands.

The location of PowerShell logs is dependent on the target platform.

- On Linux, PowerShell logs to the **systemd journal** that can forward to a
  **syslog** server. For more information, see the `man` pages for your Linux
  distribution.
- On macOS, the **os_log** logging system is used. For more information, see
  [os_log developer documentation][03].

## Configuring logging on Linux or macOS

The configuration for logging on Linux and macOS is stored in the
`powershell.config.json` file. The `powershell.config.json` file is a **JSON**
formatted file residing in the PowerShell `$PSHOME` directory. If this
configuration file doesn't exist, you'll need to create it to change the
default settings. Each installation of PowerShell uses its own copy of this
file.

By default, PowerShell enables `Informational` logging to the `Operational`
channel. You can change the configuration if you require additional log output,
such as verbose or enabling analytic log output.

The following code is an example configuration:

```json
{
  "ScriptBlockLogging": {
    "EnableScriptBlockInvocationLogging": true,
    "EnableScriptBlockLogging": true
  },
  "ModuleLogging": {
    "EnableModuleLogging": false,
    "ModuleNames": [
      "PSReadLine",
      "PowerShellGet"
    ]
  },
  "LogLevel": "verbose"
}
```

The following is a list of properties for configuring PowerShell logging. If
the property isn't listed in the configuration, PowerShell uses the default
value.

- **LogIdentity**
  - Values: `<string name>`, `powershell`
  - Description: The name to use when logging. The default identity is
    `powershell`. This value can be used to tell the difference between two
    instances of a PowerShell installation, such as a release and beta version.
    This value is also used to redirect log output to a separate file.
- **LogChannels**
  - Values: `Operational`, `Analytic`
  - Description: The channels to enable. Separate the values with a comma when
    specifying more than one. The default value is `Operational`.
- **LogLevel**
  - Values: `Always`, `Critical`, `Error`, `Warning`, `Informational`,
    `Verbose`, `Debug`
  - Description: Specify a single value. The values are listed in increasing
    order of verbosity. The value you choose enables itself and all the values
    before it. The default value is `Informational`.
- **LogKeywords**
  - Values: `Runspace`, `Pipeline`, `Protocol`, `Transport`, `Host`, `Cmdlets`,
    `Serializer`, `Session`, `ManagedPlugin`
  - Description: Keywords provide the ability to limit logging to specific
    components within PowerShell. By default, all keywords are enabled and
    change this value is only useful for specialized troubleshooting.

## Viewing PowerShell log data in journald on Linux

PowerShell logs to the **systemd journal** using the **journald** daemon on
Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

The **journald** daemon stores log messages in a binary format. Use the
`journalctl` utility to query the journal log for PowerShell entries.

```bash
journalctl --grep powershell
```

The **journald** daemon can forward log messages to a System Logging Protocol
(syslog) server. Enable the `ForwardToSysLog` option in the
`/etc/systemd/journald.conf` **journald** configuration file if you want to
use **syslog** logging on your Linux system. This is the default configuration
for many Linux distributions.

## Viewing PowerShell log data in syslog on Linux

Use the package manager for your Linux distribution to install a **syslog**
server such as **rsyslog** if you want to use syslog logging on your Linux
system. Some Linux distributions such as Ubuntu preinstall **rsyslog**.

The syslog protocol stores log messages in a standardized text format. You
can use any text processing utility to query or view **syslog** content.

By default, **syslog** writes log entries to the following location:

- On Debian-based distributions, including Ubuntu: `/var/log/syslog`
- On RHEL-based distributions: `/var/log/messages`

The following example uses the `cat` command to query for PowerShell **syslog**
entries on Ubuntu.

```bash
cat /var/log/syslog | grep -i powershell
```

### Syslog message format

Syslog messages have the following format:

```Syntax
TIMESTAMP MACHINENAME powershell[PID]: (COMMITID:TID:CID)
  [EVENTID:TASK.OPCODE.LEVEL] MESSAGE
```

- **TIMESTAMP** - A date/time when the log entry was produced.
- **MACHINENAME** - The name of the system where the log was produced.
- **PID** - The process ID of the process that wrote the log entry.
- **COMMITID** - The **git commit** ID or tag used to produce the build.
- **TID** - The thread ID of the thread that wrote the log entry.
- **CID** - The hex channel identifier of the log entry.
  - 0x10 = Operational
  - 0x11 = Analytic
- **EVENTID** - The event identifier of the log entry.
- **TASK** - The task identifier for the event entry
- **OPCODE** - The opcode for the event entry
- **LEVEL** - The log level for the event entry
- **MESSAGE** - The message associated with the event entry

**EVENTID**, **TASK**, **OPCODE**, and **LEVEL** are the same values as used
when logging to the Windows event log.

### Write PowerShell log message to a separate file

It's also possible to redirect the PowerShell log entries to a separate file.
When the PowerShell log entries are redirected to a separate file, they're no
longer logged to the default syslog file.

The following steps configure PowerShell log entries on Ubuntu to write to a
log file named `powershell.log`.

1. Create a config (`conf`) file for the PowerShell log configuration in the
   `/etc/rsyslog.d` directory using a text file editor such as `nano`. Prefix
   the filename with a number that's less than the default. For example,
   `40-powershell.conf` where the default is `50-default.conf`.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.d/40-powershell.conf
   ```

1. Add the following information to the `40-powershell.conf` file:

   ```text
   :syslogtag, contains, "powershell[" /var/log/powershell.log
   & stop
   ```

1. Verify that `/etc/rsyslog.conf` has an include statement for the new file.
   It may have a generic statement that includes it, such as:

   ```text
   $IncludeConfig /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf
   ```

   If it doesn't, you'll need to add an include statement manually.

1. Verify the attributes and permissions are set appropriately.

   ```bash
   ls -l /etc/rsyslog.d/40-powershell.conf
   ```

   ```Output
   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root   67 Nov 28 12:51 40-powershell.conf
   ```

   If your `40-powershell.conf` file has different ownership or permissions,
   complete the following steps:

   1. Set ownership to **root**.

      ```bash
      sudo chown root:root /etc/rsyslog.d/40-powershell.conf
      ```

   1. Set access permissions: **root** has read/write, **users** have read.

      ```bash
      sudo chmod 644 /etc/rsyslog.d/40-powershell.conf
      ```

1. Restart the **rsyslog** service.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart rsyslog.service
   ```

1. Run `pwsh` to generate PowerShell information to log.

   ```bash
   pwsh
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > The `/var/log/powershell.log` file isn't created until the **rsyslog**
   > service is restarted and PowerShell generates information to log.

1. Query the `powershell.log` file to verify PowerShell information is being
   logged to the new file.

   ```powershell
   cat /var/log/powershell.log
   ```

## Viewing PowerShell log output on macOS

The easiest method for viewing PowerShell log output on macOS is using the
**Console** application.

1. Search for the **Console** application and launch it.
1. Select the Machine name under **Devices**.
1. In the **Search** field, enter `pwsh` for the PowerShell main binary.
1. Change the search filter from `Any` to `Process`.
1. Perform the operations.
1. Optionally, save the search for future use.

The process ID for a running instance of PowerShell is stored in the `$PID`.
variable. Use the following steps to filter on a specific process instance of
PowerShell in the **Console**.

1. Enter the process ID for `pwsh` in the **Search** field.
1. Change the search filter to `PID`.
1. Perform the operations.

To view PowerShell log output from a command line, use the `log` command.

```powershell
sudo log stream --predicate 'process == "pwsh"' --info
```

### Persisting PowerShell log output

By default, PowerShell uses the default memory-only logging on macOS. This
behavior can be changed to enable persistence using the `log config` command.

The following script enables info level logging and persistence:

```powershell
log config --subsystem com.microsoft.powershell --mode=persist:info,level:info
```

The following command reverts PowerShell logging to the default state:

```powershell
log config --subsystem com.microsoft.powershell --mode=persist:default,level:default
```

After persistence is enabled, the `log show` command can be used to export log
items. The command provides options for exporting the last N items, items since
a given time, or items within a given time span.

For example, the following command exports items since
`9am on April 5 of 2018`:

```powershell
log show --info --start "2018-04-05 09:00:00" --predicate "process = 'pwsh'"
```

You can get help for `log` by running `log show --help` for additional details.

> [!TIP]
> When executing any of the log commands from a PowerShell prompt or script,
> use double quotes around the entire predicate string and single quotes
> within. This avoids the need to escape double quote characters within the
> predicate string.

You may also want to consider saving the event logs to a more secure location
such as [Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)][04] aggregator.
Using Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, you can set up SIEM in Azure. For more
information, see [Generic SIEM integration][01].
