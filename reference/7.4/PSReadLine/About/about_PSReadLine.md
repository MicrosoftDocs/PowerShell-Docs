## Short Description

PSReadLine provides an improved command-line editing experience in the
PowerShell console.

There have been many updates to PSReadLine since the version that ships in
Windows PowerShell 5.1.

- v2.3.5 first shipped in PowerShell 7.4.2 and 7.5.0-preview.3
- v2.3.4 first shipped in PowerShell 7.4.0-rc.1
- v2.2.6 first shipped in PowerShell 7.3.0
- v2.1.0 first shipped in PowerShell 7.2.5
- v2.0.4 first shipped in PowerShell 7.0.11
- v2.0.0 ships in Windows PowerShell 5.1

For more information about version differences, see
[about_PSReadLine_Release_Notes](about_PSReadLine_Release_Notes.md).

## Long Description

The current version of PSReadLine can be installed and used on Windows
PowerShell 5.1 and newer. For some features, you need to be running PowerShell
7.2 or higher.

PSReadLine provides a powerful command-line editing experience for the
PowerShell console. It provides:

- Syntax coloring of the command line
- A visual indication of syntax errors
- A better multi-line experience (both editing and history)
- Customizable key bindings
- Cmd and Emacs modes
- Many configuration options
- Bash style completion (optional in Cmd mode, default in Emacs mode)
- Emacs yank/kill-ring
- PowerShell token based "word" movement and deletion
- Predictive IntelliSense
- Dynamic display of Help in the console without losing your place on the
  command line

PSReadLine requires PowerShell 5.1, or newer. PSReadLine works with the default
Windows console host, Windows Terminal, and Visual Studio Code. It doesn't work
in the Windows PowerShell ISE.

PSReadLine can be installed from the PowerShell Gallery. To install PSReadLine
in a supported version of PowerShell run the following command.

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PSReadLine -AllowClobber -Force
```

> [!NOTE]
> Beginning with PowerShell 7.0, PowerShell skips autoloading PSReadLine on
> Windows if a screen reader program is detected. Currently, PSReadLine doesn't
> work well with the screen readers. The default rendering and formatting of
> PowerShell 7.0 on Windows works properly. You can manually load the module if
> necessary.

## Predictive IntelliSense

Predictive IntelliSense is an addition to the concept of tab completion that
assists the user in successfully completing commands. It enables users to
discover, edit, and execute full commands based on matching predictions from the
user's history and additional domain specific plugins.

### Enable Predictive IntelliSense

Predictive IntelliSense is disabled by default. To enable predictions, just run
the following command:

```powershell
Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionSource History
```

The **PredictionSource** parameter can also accept plugins for domain specific
and custom requirements.

To disable Predictive IntelliSense, just run:

```powershell
Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionSource None
```

## Custom Key Bindings

PSReadLine supports custom key bindings using the `Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler`
cmdlet. Most custom key bindings call one of the [bindable functions][02], for
example

```powershell
Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Key UpArrow -Function HistorySearchBackward
```

You can bind a ScriptBlock to a key. The ScriptBlock can do pretty much
anything you want. Some useful examples include

- edit the command line
- opening a new window (for example, help)
- change directories without changing the command line

The ScriptBlock receives two arguments:

- `$key` - A **[ConsoleKeyInfo]** object that is the key that triggered the
  custom binding. If you bind the same ScriptBlock to multiple keys and need to
  perform different actions depending on the key, you can check `$key`. Many
  custom bindings ignore this argument.

- `$arg` - An arbitrary argument. Most often, this would be an integer
  argument that the user passes from the key bindings DigitArgument. If your
  binding doesn't accept arguments, it's reasonable to ignore this argument.

Let's take a look at an example that adds a command line to history without
executing it. This is useful when you realize you forgot to do something, but
don't want to re-enter the command line you've already entered.

```powershell
$parameters = @{
    Key = 'Alt+w'
    BriefDescription = 'SaveInHistory'
    LongDescription = 'Save current line in history but do not execute'
    ScriptBlock = {
      param($key, $arg)   # The arguments are ignored in this example

      # GetBufferState gives us the command line (with the cursor position)
      $line = $null
      $cursor = $null
      [Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]::GetBufferState([ref]$line,
        [ref]$cursor)

      # AddToHistory saves the line in history, but does not execute it.
      [Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]::AddToHistory($line)

      # RevertLine is like pressing Escape.
      [Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]::RevertLine()
  }
}
Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler @parameters
```

You can see many more examples in the file `SamplePSReadLineProfile.ps1`, which
is installed in the **PSReadLine** module folder.

Most key bindings use some helper functions for editing the command line. Those
APIs are documented in [about_PSReadLine_Functions][02].

## Notes

### Command History

PSReadLine maintains a history file containing all the commands and data you've
entered from the command line. The history files are a file named
`$($host.Name)_history.txt`. On Windows systems the history file is stored at
`$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine`. On non-Windows systems,
the history files are stored at `$env:XDG_DATA_HOME/powershell/PSReadLine` or
`$env:HOME/.local/share/powershell/PSReadLine`.

The history can contain sensitive data including passwords. PSReadLine attempts
to filter out sensitive information. Any command lines containing the following
strings aren't written to the history file.

- `password`
- `asplaintext`
- `token`
- `apikey`
- `secret`

#### PSReadLine 2.2.0 improves the filtering of sensitive data

- Uses the PowerShell Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the parsed command line to
  look for sensitive data.
- Uses an allowlist of safe cmdlets from the **SecretManagement** module to
  allow those commands to be added to the history. The allowlist contains:
  - `Get-Secret`
  - `Get-SecretInfo`
  - `Get-SecretVault`
  - `Register-SecretVault`
  - `Remove-Secret`
  - `Set-SecretInfo`
  - `Set-SecretVaultDefault`
  - `Test-SecretVault`
  - `Unlock-SecretVault`
  - `Unregister-SecretVault`

For example, the following commands are allowed to be written to the history
file:

```powershell
Get-Secret PSGalleryApiKey -AsPlainText # Get-Secret is in the allowlist
$token = Get-Secret -Name github-token -Vault MySecret
[MyType]::CallRestAPI($token, $url, $args)
$template -f $token
```

The following commands aren't being written to the history file:

```powershell
$token = 'abcd' # Assign expr-value to sensitive variable name.
Set-Secret abc $mySecret # Set-Secret is not in the allowlist.
ConvertTo-SecureString stringValue -AsPlainText # '-AsPlainText' is an alert.
Invoke-WebRequest -Token xxx # Expr-value as argument to '-Token'.
Get-ResultFromTwo -Secret1 (Get-Secret -Name blah -AsPlainText) -Secret2 sdv87ysdfayf798hfasd8f7ha # '-Secret2' has expr-value argument.
```

If there are other commands you don't want written to the history files, you
can use the **AddToHistoryHandler** parameter of the `Set-PSReadLineOption`
cmdlet. For an example of how to use **AddToHistoryHandler**, see Example 7 of
[Set-PSReadLineOption][01].

#### PSReadLine 2.3.4 improves the filtering of sensitive data

Improved the default sensitive history scrubbing to allow the history to
contain safe property access.

When the sensitive string is part of a property access:

- If this member access operation isn't part of an assignment, then we
  consider it safe
- Otherwise, if the right-hand side is a pipeline or a variable, we also
  consider it safe

For example, the following use cases are considered safe and can be saved to
the history.

```powershell
$a.Secret = Get-Secret -Name github-token -Vault MySecret
$a.Secret = $secret
$a.Password.Secret | Set-Value
$token = (Get-AzAccessToken -ResourceUrl 'https://app.contoso.com').Token
```

The release also improved the sensitive history scrubbing to allow retrieving
token using the `az`, `gcloud`, and `kubectl` command-line tools.

For example, the following use cases are considered safe and can be saved to
the history.

```powershell
kubectl get secrets
kubectl get secret db-user-pass -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode
kubectl describe secret db-user-pass
az account get-access-token --resource=https://app.contoso.com --query accessToken --output tsv
$env:PGPASS = gcloud auth print-access-token
```
