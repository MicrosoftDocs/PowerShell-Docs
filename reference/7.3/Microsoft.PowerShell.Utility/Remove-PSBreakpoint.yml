examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Remove all breakpoints'
  code: |-
    Get-PSBreakpoint | Remove-PSBreakpoint
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This command deletes all of the breakpoints in the current console.

- title: 'Example 2: Remove a specified breakpoint'
  code: |-
    $B = Set-PSBreakpoint -Script "sample.ps1" -Variable "Name"
    $B | Remove-PSBreakpoint
  description: |-
    The `Set-PSBreakpoint` cmdlet creates a breakpoint on the `$Name` variable in the `Sample.ps1`
    script and saves the breakpoint object in the `$B` variable. The `Remove-PSBreakpoint` cmdlet
    deletes the new breakpoint. It uses a pipeline operator (`|`) to send the breakpoint object in the
    `$B` variable to the `Remove-PSBreakpoint` cmdlet.

    As a result of this command, if you run the script, it runs to completion without stopping. Also,
    the `Get-PSBreakpoint` cmdlet does not return this breakpoint.
  summary: |+
    This command deletes a breakpoint.

- title: 'Example 3: Remove a breakpoint by ID'
  code: |-
    Remove-PSBreakpoint -Id 2
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This command deletes the breakpoint with breakpoint ID 2.

- title: 'Example 4: Use a function to remove all breakpoints'
  code: |-
    function del-psb { Get-PSBreakpoint | Remove-PSBreakpoint }
  description: |-
    It uses the `Get-PSBreakpoint` cmdlet to get the breakpoints. Then, it uses a pipeline operator
    (`|`) to send the breakpoints to the `Remove-PSBreakpoint` cmdlet, which deletes them.
  summary: |+
    This simple function deletes all the breakpoints in the current session.

- title: 'Example 5: Remove a breakpoint in a runspace'
  code: |-
    Start-Job -ScriptBlock {
        Set-PSBreakpoint -Command Start-Sleep
        Start-Sleep -Seconds 10
    }

    $runspace = Get-Runspace -Id 1

    Get-PSBreakPoint -Runspace $runspace | Remove-Breakpoint -Runspace $runspace
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    In this example, a job is started and a breakpoint is set to break when the `Set-PSBreakPoint` is
    run. The runspace is stored in a variable and passed to the `Get-PSBreakPoint` command with the
    **Runspace** parameter. The output of `Get-PSBreakPoint` is piped to `Remove-PSBreakpoint` to
    remove the breakpoint in the runspace.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.Breakpoint" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Breakpoint
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the breakpoints to delete. Enter a variable that contains breakpoint objects or a command
    that gets breakpoint objects, such as a `Get-PSBreakpoint` command. You can also pipe breakpoint
    objects to `Remove-PSBreakpoint`.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Id
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies breakpoint IDs for which this cmdlet deletes breakpoints.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Runspace" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Runspace
  description: |+
    Specifies the Id of a **Runspace** object so you can interact with breakpoints in the specified
    runspace.

    This parameter was added in PowerShell 7.2.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: RunspaceId
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
    The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.Remove-PSBreakpoint
name: Remove-PSBreakpoint
description: |-
  The `Remove-PSBreakpoint` cmdlet deletes a breakpoint. Enter a breakpoint object or a breakpoint ID.

  When you remove a breakpoint, the breakpoint object is no longer available or functional. If you
  have saved a breakpoint object in a variable, the reference still exists, but the breakpoint does
  not function.

  `Remove-PSBreakpoint` is one of several cmdlets designed for debugging PowerShell scripts. For more
  information about the PowerShell debugger, see
  [about_Debuggers](../microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_debuggers.md).
