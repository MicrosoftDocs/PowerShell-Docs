description: |-
  The `Get-TraceSource` cmdlet gets the trace sources for PowerShell components that are currently in
  use. You can use the data to determine which PowerShell components you can trace. When tracing, the
  component generates detailed messages about each step in its internal processing. Developers use the
  trace data to monitor data flow, program execution, and errors.

  The tracing cmdlets were designed for PowerShell developers, but they are available to all users.
