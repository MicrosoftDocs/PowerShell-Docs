  > **This cmdlet is only available on the Windows platform.**

  The `Get-WSManCredSSP` cmdlet gets the Credential Security Support Provider-related configuration of
  the client and the server. The output indicates whether Credential Security Support Provider
  (CredSSP) authentication is enabled or disabled. This cmdlet also displays configuration information
  for the **AllowFreshCredentials** policy of CredSSP.

  When you use CredSSP authentication, the user credentials are passed to a remote computer to be
  authenticated. This type of authentication is designed for commands that create a remote session
  from another remote session. For example, if you want to run a background job on a remote computer,
  use this kind of authentication.

  The cmdlet performs the following actions:

  - Gets the WS-Management CredSSP setting on the client
    (`<localhost|computername>\Client\Auth\CredSSP`).
  - Gets the Windows CredSSP policy setting **AllowFreshCredentials**.
  - Gets the WS-Management CredSSP setting on the server
    (`<localhost|computername>\Service\Auth\CredSSP`).

  > [!CAUTION]
  > CredSSP authentication delegates the user credentials from the local computer to a remote
  > computer. This practice increases the security risk of the remote operation. If the remote
  > computer is compromised, when credentials are passed to it, the credentials can be used to control
  > the network session.
