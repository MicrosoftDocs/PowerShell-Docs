# Copy-Item

## SYNOPSIS

Copies an item from one location to another.

## SYNTAX

### Path (Default)

```
Copy-Item [-Path] <String[]> [[-Destination] <String>] [-Container] [-Force] [-Filter <String>]
 [-Include <String[]>] [-Exclude <String[]>] [-Recurse] [-PassThru] [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm] [-UseTransaction] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### LiteralPath

```
Copy-Item -LiteralPath <String[]> [[-Destination] <String>] [-Container] [-Force] [-Filter <String>]
 [-Include <String[]>] [-Exclude <String[]>] [-Recurse] [-PassThru] [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm] [-UseTransaction] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Copy-Item` cmdlet copies an item from one location to another location in the same namespace.
For instance, it can copy a file to a folder, but it cannot copy a file to a certificate drive.

This cmdlet does not cut or delete the items being copied.
The particular items that the cmdlet can copy depend on the PowerShell provider that exposes the item.
For instance, it can copy files and directories in a file system drive and registry keys and entries in the registry drive.

This cmdlet can copy and rename items in the same command.
To rename an item, enter the new name in the value of the **Destination** parameter.
To rename an item and not copy it, use the `Rename-Item` cmdlet.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Copy a file to the specified directory

This command copies the "mar1604.log.txt" file to the "C:\Presentation" directory.
The command does not delete the original file.

```powershell
Copy-Item "C:\Wabash\Logfiles\mar1604.log.txt" -Destination "C:\Presentation"
```

### Example 2: Copy the contents of a directory to another directory

This command copies the entire contents of the "Logfiles" directory into the "Drawings" directory.
If the "LogFiles" directory contains files in subdirectories, those subdirectories are copied with their file trees intact.
The **Container** parameter is set to "true" by default.
This preserves the directory structure.

```powershell
Copy-Item "C:\Logfiles\*" -Destination "C:\Drawings" -Recurse
```

### Example 3: Copy the contents of a directory to another directory and create the destination directory if it does not exist

This command copies the contents of the "C:\Logfiles" directory to the "C:\Drawings\Logs" directory.
It creates the "\Logs" subdirectory if it does not already exist.

```powershell
Copy-Item C:\Logfiles -Destination C:\Drawings\Logs -Recurse
```

### Example 4: Copy a file to the specified directory and rename the file

This command uses the `Copy-Item` cmdlet to copy the "Get-Widget.ps1" script from the "\\\\Server01\Share" directory to the "\\\\Server12\ScriptArchive" directory.
As part of the copy operation, the command also changes the item name from "Get-Widget.ps1" to "Get-Widget.ps1.txt", so it can be attached to email messages.

```powershell
Copy-Item "\\Server01\Share\Get-Widget.ps1" -Destination "\\Server12\ScriptArchive\Get-Widget.ps1.txt"
```

### -Credential

Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
The default is the current user.

Type a user name, such as "User01" or "Domain01\User01", or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one generated by the `Get-Credential` cmdlet.
If you type a user name, you are prompted for a password.

> [!WARNING]
> This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with Windows PowerShell.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Current user
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Destination

Specifies the path to the new location.
To rename a copied item, include the new name in the value.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Exclude

Specifies, as a string array, an item or items that this cmdlet excludes from the operation.
The value of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter.
Enter a path element or pattern, such as "*.txt".
Wildcard characters are permitted.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -Filter

Specifies a filter in the format or language of the provider.
The value of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter.

The syntax of the filter, including the use of wildcard characters, depends on the provider.
Filters are more efficient than other parameters, because the provider applies them when the cmdlet gets the objects rather than having PowerShell filter the objects after they are retrieved.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -Force

Indicates that this cmdlet copies items that cannot otherwise be changed, such as copying over a read-only file or alias.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Include

Specifies, as a string array, an item or items that this cmdlet includes in the operation.
The value of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter.
Enter a path element or pattern, such as "*.txt".
Wildcard characters are permitted.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LiteralPath

Specifies a path to the item.
Unlike the **Path** parameter, the value of **LiteralPath** is used exactly as it is typed.
No characters are interpreted as wildcards.
If the path includes escape characters, enclose it in single quotation marks.
Single quotation marks tell PowerShell not to interpret any characters as escape sequences.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: LiteralPath
Aliases: PSPath

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PassThru

Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Path

Specifies, as a string array, the path to the items to copy.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: Path
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Recurse

Indicates that this cmdlet performs a recursive copy.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UseTransaction

Includes the command in the active transaction.
This parameter is valid only when a transaction is in progress.
For more information, see about_Transactions.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: usetx

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
