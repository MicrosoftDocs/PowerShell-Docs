# New-Service

## SYNOPSIS
Creates a new Windows service.

## SYNTAX

```
New-Service [-Name] <String> [-BinaryPathName] <String> [-DisplayName <String>] [-Description <String>]
 [-StartupType <ServiceStartMode>] [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-DependsOn <String[]>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The New-Service cmdlet creates a new entry for a Windows service in the registry and in the service database.
A new service requires an executable file that executes during the service.

The parameters of this cmdlet let you set the display name, description, startup type, and dependencies of the service.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------
```
PS C:\> new-service -name TestService -binaryPathName "C:\WINDOWS\System32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs"
```

This command creates a new service named "TestService".

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------
```
PS C:\> new-service -name TestService -binaryPathName "C:\WINDOWS\System32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs" -dependson NetLogon -displayName "Test Service" -StartupType Manual -Description "This is a test service."
```

This command creates a new service named "TestService".
It uses the parameters of the New-Service cmdlet to specify a description, startup type, and display name for the new service.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 --------------------------
```
PS C:\> get-wmiobject win32_service -filter "name='testservice'"

ExitCode  : 0
Name      : testservice
ProcessId : 0
StartMode : Auto
State     : Stopped
Status    : OK
```

This command uses the Get-WmiObject cmdlet to get the Win32_Service object for the new service.
This object includes the start mode and the service description.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 --------------------------
```
PS C:\> sc.exe delete TestService
- or -
PS C:\> (get-wmiobject win32_service -filter "name='TestService'").delete()
```

This example shows two ways to delete the TestService service.
The first command uses the delete option of Sc.exe.
The second command uses the Delete method of the Win32_Service objects that the Get-WmiObject cmdlet returns.

## PARAMETERS

### -BinaryPathName
Specifies the path to the executable file for the service.
This parameter is required.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: True
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False

Or, enter a PSCredential object, such as one from the Get-Credential cmdlet.
If you type a user name, you will be prompted for a password.

```yaml

Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

-  Automatic:  The service is to be started (or was started) by the operating system, at system start-up. If an automatically started service depends on a manually started service, the manually started service is also started automatically at system startup.
- Disabled: The service is disabled and cannot be started by a user or application.

```yaml

Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

## OUTPUTS

### System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController
New-Service returns an object that represents the new service.

## NOTES
* To run this cmdlet on Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, start Windows PowerShell with the "Run as administrator" option.

  To delete a service, use Sc.exe, or use the Get-WmiObject cmdlet to get the Win32_Service object that represents the service and then use the Delete method to delete the service.
(The object that Get-Service returns does not have a delete method.) For an example, see the Examples section.
