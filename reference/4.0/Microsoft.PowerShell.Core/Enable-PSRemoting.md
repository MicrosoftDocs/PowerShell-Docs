# Enable-PSRemoting

## SYNOPSIS
Configures the computer to receive remote commands.

## SYNTAX

```
Enable-PSRemoting [-Force] [-SkipNetworkProfileCheck] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Enable-PSRemoting** cmdlet configures the computer to receive Windows PowerShell remote commands that are sent by using the WS-Management technology.

On Windows ServerÂ® 2012, Windows PowerShell remoting is enabled by default.
You can use Enable-PSRemoting to enable Windows PowerShell remoting on other supported versions of Windows and to re-enable remoting on Windows Server 2012 if it becomes disabled.

You need to run this command only once on each computer that will receive commands.
You do not need to run it on computers that only send commands.
Because the configuration activates listeners, it is prudent to run it only where it is needed.

Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, the **Enable-PSRemoting** cmdlet can enable Windows PowerShell remoting on client versions of Windows when the computer is on a public network.
For more information, see the description of the **SkipNetworkProfileCheck** parameter.

The **Enable-PSRemoting** cmdlet performs the following operations:

- Runs the [Set-WSManQuickConfig](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=141463) cmdlet, which performs the following tasks:
 - Starts the WinRM service.
 - Sets the startup type on the WinRM service to Automatic.
 - Creates a listener to accept requests on any IP address.
 - Enables a firewall exception for WS-Management communications.
 - Registers the Microsoft.PowerShell and Microsoft.PowerShell.Workflow session configurations, if it they are not already registered.
 - Registers the Microsoft.PowerShell32 session configuration on 64-bit computers, if it is not already registered.
 - Enables all session configurations.
 - Changes the security descriptor of all session configurations to allow remote access.
- Restarts the WinRM service to make the preceding changes effective.

To run this cmdlet, start Windows PowerShell with the "Run as administrator" option.

CAUTION: On systems that have both Windows PowerShell 3.0 and the Windows PowerShell 2.0 engine, do not use Windows PowerShell 2.0 to run the **Enable-PSRemoting** and Disable-PSRemoting cmdlets.
The commands might appear to succeed, but the remoting is not configured correctly.
Remote commands, and later attempts to enable and disable remoting, are likely to fail.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```
PS C:\> Enable-PSRemoting
```

This command configures the computer to receive remote commands.

### Example 2
```
PS C:\> Enable-PSRemoting -Force
```

This command configures the computer to receive remote commands.
It uses the Force parameter to suppress the user prompts.

### Example 3
```
PS C:\> Enable-PSRemoting -SkipNetworkProfileCheck -Force

PS C:\> Set-NetFirewallRule -Name "WINRM-HTTP-In-TCP-PUBLIC" -RemoteAddress Any
```

This example shows how to allow remote access from public networks on client versions of Windows.
Before using these commands, analyze the security setting and verify that the computer network will be safe from harm.

The first command enables remoting in Windows PowerShell.
By default, this creates network rules that allow remote access from private and domain networks.
The command uses the **SkipNetworkProfileCheck** parameter to allow remote access from public networks in the same local subnet.
The command uses the Force parameter to suppress confirmation messages.

The **SkipNetworkProfileCheck** parameter has no effect on server version of Windows, which allow remote access from public networks in the same local subnet by default.

The second command eliminates the subnet restriction.
The command uses the **Set-NetFirewallRule** cmdlet in the **NetSecurity** module to add a firewall rule that allows remote access from public networks from any remote location, including locations in different subnets.

## PARAMETERS

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
Suppresses all user prompts.
By default, you are prompted to confirm each operation.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SkipNetworkProfileCheck
Enables remoting on client versions of Windows when the computer is on a public network.
This parameter enables a firewall rule for public networks that allows remote access only from computers in the same local subnet.

This parameter has no effect on server versions of Windows, which, by default, have a local subnet firewall rule for public networks.
If the local subnet firewall rule is disabled on a server version of Windows, **Enable-PSRemoting** re-enables it, regardless of the value of this parameter.

To remove the local subnet restriction and enable remote access from all locations on public networks, use the **Set-NetFirewallRule** cmdlet in the **NetSecurity** module.
For more information, see Notes and Examples.

This parameter is introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### None
You cannot pipe input to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### System.String
Enable-PSRemoting returns strings that describe its results.

## NOTES
* In Windows PowerShell 3.0, **Enable-PSRemoting** creates the following firewall exceptions for WS-Management communications.

  On server versions of Windows, **Enable-PSRemoting** creates firewall rules  for private and domain networks that allow remote access, and creates a firewall rule for public networks that allows remote access only from computers in the same local subnet.

   On client versions of Windows, **Enable-PSRemoting** in Windows PowerShell 3.0 creates firewall rules for private and domain networks that allow unrestricted remote access.
To create a firewall rule for public networks that allows remote access from the same local subnet, use the **SkipNetworkProfileCheck** parameter.

  On client or server versions of Windows, to create a firewall rule for public networks that removes the local subnet restriction and allows remote access , use the **Set-NetFirewallRule** cmdlet in the NetSecurity module to run the following command: `Set-NetFirewallRule -Name "WINRM-HTTP-In-TCP-PUBLIC" -RemoteAddress Any`

* In Windows PowerShell 2.0, **Enable-PSRemoting** creates the following firewall exceptions for WS-Management communications.

  On server versions of Windows, it creates firewall rules for all networks that allow remote access.

   On client versions of Windows, Enable-PSRemoting in Windows PowerShell 2.0 creates a firewall exception only for domain and private network locations.
To minimize security risks, **Enable-PSRemoting** does not create a firewall rule for public networks on client versions of Windows.
When the current network location is public, **Enable-PSRemoting** returns the following message: "Unable to check the status of the firewall."

* Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, **Enable-PSRemoting** enables all session configurations by setting the value of the **Enabled** property of all session configurations (WSMan:\\\<ComputerName\>\Plugin\\\<SessionConfigurationName\>\Enabled) to True ($true).
* In Windows PowerShell 2.0, **Enable-PSRemoting** removes the Deny_All setting from the security descriptor of session configurations. In Windows PowerShell 3.0, **Enable-PSRemoting** removes the Deny_All and Network_Deny_All settings, thereby providing remote access to session configurations that were reserved for local use.
