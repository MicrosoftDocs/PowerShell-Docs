# FileSystem Provider
## PROVIDER NAME  
 FileSystem  
  
## DRIVES  
 C, D  
  
## SHORT DESCRIPTION  
 Provides access to files and directories.  
  
## DETAILED DESCRIPTION  
 The Windows PowerShell FileSystem provider lets you get, add, change, clear, and delete files and directories in Windows PowerShell.  
  
 The FileSystem provider exposes Windows PowerShell drives that correspond to the logical drives on your computer, including drives that are mapped to network shares. This lets you reference these drives from within Windows PowerShell.  
  
 The FileSystem provider lets you refer to files and folders in Windows PowerShell in the same way that you refer to them in Windows.  
  
 To refer to a drive, specify the drive name followed by a colon. Like most of Windows PowerShell, the FileSystem provider is not case-sensitive. For example, to get the files and folders on the C drive, you refer to the "C:" drive or the "c:" drive.  
  
 A fully qualified name includes the drive name, followed by a colon, any directory and subdirectory names, and the file name (when applicable). Each element of the fully qualified name must be separated either by a backslash (\\) or a forward slash (/).  
  
 The following example shows the fully qualified name for the Shell.dll file in the System32 subdirectory of the Windows directory on the C drive:  
  
 C:\\Windows\\System32\\shell.dll  
  
 If any element in the fully qualified name includes spaces, you must enclose the name in quotation marks.  
  
 For example,  
  
 "C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\iexplore.exe"  
  
 The current location in the file system is represented by a dot or period character (.)  
  
 For example, the current location is the C:\\Windows\\System32 directory, then you can refer to the Shell.dll file in that directory as the following:  
  
 .\\Shell.dll  
  
 To use the FileSystem provider to view and manage files and folders, use the provider cmdlets, such as [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md) ("dir", "ls") and [Set-Location](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Set-Location.md) ("cd"). Windows PowerShell also includes a "mkdir" function (alias = "md") that uses the [New-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/New-Item.md) cmdlet to create a new directory.  
  
 Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, you can get customized help topics for provider cmdlets that explain how those cmdlets behave in a file system drive.  
  
 To get the help topics that are customized for the file system drive, run a [Get-Help](../Get-Help.md) command in a file system drive or use the Path parameter of [Get-Help](../Get-Help.md) to specify a file system drive.  
  
 For example,  
  
 PS C:\\> [Get-Help](../Get-Help.md) get-childitem  
  
 PS HKLM:\\> [Get-Help](../Get-Help.md)[Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md) -path c:  
  
 Also, beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, the FileSystem provider supports credentials for the [New-PSDrive](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/New-PSDrive.md) cmdlet. For more information, see the help topic for the [New-PSDrive](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/New-PSDrive.md) cmdlet.  
  
## CAPABILITIES  
 Filter, ShouldProcess  
  
## EXAMPLES  
  
### Splitting a Large File  
  
#### Example 1  
 By default, the Get-Content cmdlet uses the end-of-line character as its delimiter, so it gets a file as a collection of strings, with each line as one string in the file.  
  
 You can use the Delimiter parameter to specify an alternate delimiter. If you set it to the characters that denote the end of a section or the beginning of the next section, you can split the file into logical parts.  
  
 The first command gets the Employees.txt file and splits it into sections, each of which ends with the words "End of Employee Record" and it saves it in the $e variable.  
  
 The second command uses array notation to get the first item in the collection in $e. It uses an index of 0, because Windows PowerShell arrays are zero-based.  
  
 For more information about arrays, see about_Arrays.  
  
```  
$e = get-content c:\test\employees.txt -delimited "End Of Employee Record"  
  
$e[0]  
  
```  
  
### Navigating the File System  
  
#### Example 1  
 This command gets the current location:  
  
```  
get-location  
  
```  
  
 The Get-Location cmdlet includes the functionality of commands like the cd command in the Windows Command Prompt and the pwd command in UNIX. For more information, type:  
    get-help get-location  
  
#### Example 2  
 This command sets the current location:  
  
```  
set-location C:  
  
```  
  
### Getting File and Directory Information  
  
#### Example 1  
 This command gets all the files and directories in the current directory:  
  
```  
get-childitem  
  
```  
  
 By default, the Get-ChildItem cmdlet does not recurse. If files and folders are present in the current directory when you run this command, a System.IO.FileInfo object and a System.IO.DirectoryInfo object are returned.  
  
#### Example 2  
 This command gets all the files in the current directory:  
  
```  
get-childitem | where-object {!$_.psiscontainer}  
  
```  
  
 The command uses the Get-ChildItem cmdlet to get all files and directories. It pipes the results to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only the objects that are not (!) containers.  
  
#### Example 3  
 The command uses the Get-ChildItem cmdlet to get all files and directories. It pipes the results to Where-Object, which select only the objects that are containers.  
  
```  
get-childitem | where-object {$_.psiscontainer}  
  
```  
  
#### Example 4  
 This command displays the properties of a directory:  
  
```  
get-item -path c:\ps-test | format-list -property *  
  
```  
  
 The command uses the Path parameter of the Get-Item cmdlet to get the C:\ps-test directory. It pipes the directory object to the Format-List cmdlet, which displays all (*) the properties and values of the directory in a list.  
  
#### Example 5  
 This command displays the properties of a file:  
  
```  
get-item -path test.txt | format-list -property *  
  
```  
  
 The command uses the Path parameter of the Get-Item cmdlet to get the test.txt file. It pipes the file object to the Format-List cmdlet, which displays all (*) the properties and values of the file in a list.  
  
### Copying Files and Directories  
  
#### Example 1  
 This command copies the A.txt file from the C:\A directory to the C:\A\Bb directory:  
  
```  
copy-item -path C:\a\a.txt -destination C:\a\bb\a.txt  
  
```  
  
 It overwrites files in the destination directory without prompting for confirmation.  
  
#### Example 2  
 This command copies all the files in the C:\A\Bb directory that have the .txt file name extension to the C:\A\Cc\Ccc\ directory:  
  
```  
copy-item -path C:\a\bb\*.txt -destination C:\a\cc\ccc\  
  
```  
  
 It uses the original names of the files. The command overwrites the existing files in the destination directory without prompting for confirmation.  
  
#### Example 3  
 Copies all the directories and files in the C:\a directory to the C:\c directory. If any of the directories to copy already exist in the destination directory, the command will fail unless you specify the Force parameter.  
  
```  
copy-item -path C:\a\* -destination C:\c -recurse  
  
```  
  
### Moving Files and Directories  
  
#### Example 1  
 This command moves the C.txt file in the C:\A directory to the C:\A\Aa directory:  
  
```  
move-item -path C:\a\c.txt -destination C:\a\aa  
  
```  
  
 The command will not automatically overwrite an existing file that has the same name. To force the cmdlet to overwrite an existing file, specify the Force parameter.  
  
#### Example 2  
 This command moves the C:\A directory and all its contents to the C:\B directory:  
  
```  
move-item -path C:\a -destination C:\b  
  
```  
  
 You cannot move a directory when that directory is the current location.  
  
### Managing File Content  
  
#### Example 1  
 This command appends the "test content" string to the Test.txt file:  
  
```  
add-content -path test.txt -value "test content"  
  
```  
  
 The existing content in the Test.txt file is not deleted.  
  
#### Example 2  
 This command gets the contents of the Test.txt file and displays them in the console:  
  
```  
get-content -path test.txt  
  
```  
  
 You can pipe the contents of the file to another cmdlet. For example, the following command reads the contents of the Test.txt file and then supplies them as input to the ConvertTo-HTML cmdlet:  
get-content -path test.txt &#124; convertto-html  
  
#### Example 3  
 This command replaces the contents of the Test.txt file with the "test content" string:  
  
```  
set-content -path test.txt -value "test content"  
  
```  
  
 It overwrites the contents of Test.txt. You can use the Value parameter of the New-Item cmdlet to add content to a file when you create it.  
  
### Managing Security Descriptors  
  
#### Example 1  
 This command returns a System.Security.AccessControl.FileSecurity object:  
  
```  
get-acl -path test.txt | format-list -property *  
  
```  
  
 For more information about this object, pipe the command to the Get-Member cmdlet. Or, see "FileSecurity Class" in the MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network) library at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=145718.  
  
#### Example 2  
 This command returns a System.Security.AccessControl.DirectorySecurity object:  
  
```  
get-acl -path test_directory | format-list -property *  
  
```  
  
 For more information about this object, pipe the command to the Get-Member cmdlet. Or, see "DirectorySecurity Class" in the MSDN library at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=145736.  
  
### Creating Files and Directories  
  
#### Example 1  
 This command creates the Logfiles directory on the C drive:  
  
```  
new-item -path c:\ -name logfiles -type directory  
  
```  
  
#### Example 2  
 This command creates the Log2.txt file in the C:\Logfiles directory and then adds the "test log" string to the file:  
  
```  
new-item -path c:\logfiles -name log.txt -type file  
  
```  
  
#### Example 3  
 Creates a file called Log2.txt in the C:\logfiles directory and adds the string "test log" to the file.  
  
```  
new-item -path c:\logfiles -name log2.txt -type file -value "test log"  
  
```  
  
### Renaming Files and Directories  
  
#### Example 1  
 This command renames the A.txt file in the C:\A directory to B.txt:  
  
```  
rename-item -path c:\a\a.txt -newname b.txt  
  
```  
  
#### Example 2  
 This command renames the C:\A\Cc directory to C:\A\Dd:  
  
```  
rename-item -path c:\a\cc -newname dd  
  
```  
  
### Deleting Files and Directories  
  
#### Example 1  
 This command deletes the Test.txt file in the current directory:  
  
```  
remove-item -path test.txt  
  
```  
  
#### Example 2  
 This command deletes all the files in the current directory that have the .xml file name extension:  
  
```  
remove-item -path *.xml  
  
```  
  
### Starting a Program by Invoking an Associated File  
  
#### Example 1  
 The first command uses the Get-Service cmdlet to get information about local services.  
  
 It pipes the information to the Export-Csv cmdlet and then stores that information in the Services.csv file.  
  
 The second command uses Invoke-Item to open the Services.csv file in the program associated with the .csv extension:  
  
```  
get-service | export-csv -path services.csv  
  
invoke-item -path services.csv  
  
```  
  
### Getting Files and Folders with Specified Attributes  
  
#### Example 1  
 This command gets system files in the current directory and its subdirectories.  
  
 It uses the File parameter to get only files (not directories) and the System parameter to get only items with the System attribute.  
  
 It uses the Recurse parameter to get the items in the current directory and all subdirectories.  
  
```  
get-childitem -file -system  -recurse  
  
```  
  
#### Example 2  
 This command gets all files, including hidden files, in the current directory.  
  
 It uses the Attributes parameter with two values, !Directory+Hidden, which gets hidden files, and !Directory, which gets all other files.  
  
```  
Get-ChildItem -attributes !Directory,!Directory+Hidden  
  
```  
  
 "dir -att !d,!d+h" is the equivalent of this command.  
  
#### Example 3  
 This command gets files in the current directory that are either compressed or encrypted.  
  
 It uses the Attributes parameter with two values, Compressed and Encrypted. The values are separated by a comma (,) which represents the OR operator.  
  
```  
Get-ChildItem -attributes Compressed,Encrypted  
  
```  
  
## DYNAMIC PARAMETERS  
 Dynamic parameters are cmdlet parameters that are added by a Windows PowerShell provider and are available only when the cmdlet is being used in the provider-enabled drive.  
  
### Encoding <Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.FileSystemCmdletProviderEncoding>  
 Specifies the file encoding. The default is ASCII.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|Unknown|The encoding type is unknown or invalid. The data can be treated as binary.|  
|String|Uses the encoding type for a string.|  
|Unicode|Encodes in UTF-16 format using the little-endian byte order.|  
|Byte|Encodes a set of characters into a sequence of bytes.|  
|BigEndianUnicode|Encodes in UTF-16 format using the big-endian byte order.|  
|UTF8|Encodes in UTF-8 format.|  
|UTF7|Encodes in UTF-7 format.|  
|ASCII|Uses the encoding for the ASCII (7-bit) character set.|  
  
#### Cmdlets supported:  
  
-   [Add-Content](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Add-Content.md)  
  
-   [Get-Content](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Content.md)  
  
-   [Set-Content](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Set-Content.md)  
  
### Delimiter <System.String>  
 Specifies the delimiter that [Get-Content](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Content.md) uses to divide the file into objects while it reads.  
  
 The default is "\n", the end-of-line character.  
  
 Therefore, by default, when reading a text file, [Get-Content](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Content.md) returns a collection of string objects, each of which ends with an end-of-line character.  
  
 When you enter a delimiter that does not exist in the file, [Get-Content](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Content.md) returns the entire file as a single, undelimited object.  
  
 You can use this parameter to split a large file into smaller files by specifying a file separator, such as "End of Example", as the delimiter. The delimiter is preserved (not discarded) and becomes the last item in each file section.  
  
 Troubleshooting Note: Currently, when the value of the Delimiter parameter is an empty string, [Get-Content](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Content.md) does not return anything. This is a known issue. To force [Get-Content](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Content.md) to return the entire file as a single, undelimited string, enter a value that does not exist in the file.  
  
#### Cmdlets supported:  
  
-   [Get-Content](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Content.md)  
  
### Wait <System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter>  
 Waits for content to be appended to the file. If content is appended, it returns the appended content. If the content has changed, it returns the entire file.  
  
 When waiting, [Get-Content](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Content.md) checks the file once each second until you interrupt it, such as by pressing CTRL+C.  
  
#### Cmdlets supported:  
  
-   [Get-Content](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Content.md)  
  
### Attributes <FlagsExpression[System.IO.FileAttributes]>  
 Gets files and folders with the specified attributes.  This parameter supports all attributes and lets you specify complex combinations of attributes.  
  
 The Attributes parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.  
  
 The Attributes parameter supports the following attributes: Archive, Compressed, Device, Directory, Encrypted, Hidden, Normal, NotContentIndexed, Offline, ReadOnly, ReparsePoint, SparseFile, System, and Temporary. For a description of these attributes, see the FileAttributes enumeration at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=201508.  
  
 Use the following operators to combine attributes.  
  
 ! NOT  
  
 \+ AND  
  
 , OR  
  
 No spaces are permitted between an operator and its attribute. However, spaces are permitted before commas.  
  
#### Cmdlets supported:  
  
-   [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md)  
  
### Directory <System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter>  
 Gets directories (folders).  
  
 The Directory parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.  
  
 To get only directories, use the Directory parameter and omit the File parameter. To exclude directories, use the File parameter and omit the Directory parameter, or use the Attributes parameter.  
  
#### Cmdlets supported:  
  
-   [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md)  
  
### File <System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter>

#### Cmdlets supported:  
  
-   [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md)  
  
### Hidden <System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter>  
 Gets only hidden files and directories (folders). By default, [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md) gets only non-hidden items.  
  
 The Hidden parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.  
  
 To get only hidden items, use the Hidden parameter, its "h" or "ah" aliases, or the Hidden value of the Attributes parameter. To exclude hidden items, omit the Hidden parameter or use the Attributes parameter.  
  
#### Cmdlets supported:  
  
-   [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md)  
  
### ReadOnly <System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter>  
 Gets only read-only files and directories (folders).  
  
 The ReadOnly parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.  
  
 To get only read-only items, use the ReadOnly parameter, its "ar" alias, or the ReadOnly value of the Attributes parameter. To exclude read-only items, use the Attributes parameter.  
  
#### Cmdlets supported:  
  
-   [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md)  
  
### System <System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter>
