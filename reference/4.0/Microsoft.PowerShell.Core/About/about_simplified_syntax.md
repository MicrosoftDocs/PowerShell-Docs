# about_Simplified_Syntax

## SHORT DESCRIPTION

Describes easier, more natural-language ways of scripting filters for
collections of objects.

## LONG DESCRIPTION

Simplified syntax, introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0, lets you build some
filter commands without using script blocks. The simplified syntax more
closely resembles natural language, and is primarily useful with collections
of objects that are piped into Where-Object and ForEach-Object commands, and
with the Where and ForEach language keywords.

You can use a method on the members of a collection (most commonly, an array)
without either containing it in a script block, or adding the automatic
variable "\$_."

Compare the following two examples.

### Standard Syntax

```powershell
dir Cert:\LocalMachine\Root | where {$_.FriendlyName -eq 'Verisign'}
dir Cert:\ -Recurse | foreach {$_.GetKeyAlgorithm()}
```

### Simplified syntax

With simplified syntax, comparison operators that work on the members of a
collection are treated as parameters. You can use a method on the members of a
collection without containing it in a script block or adding the automatic
variable \$_. Compare the following to the previous example:

```powershell
dir Cert:\LocalMachine\Root | where FriendlyName -eq 'Verisign'
dir Cert:\ -Recurse | foreach GetKeyAlgorithm
```

Although both commands work, the second returns results without using a script
block or the \$_. automatic variable. The method GetKeyAlgorithm is treated as
a parameter of ForEach. The second command returns the same results, but
without errors, because the simplified syntax does not attempt to return
results for items for which the specified argument did not apply.

In this example, the Get-Process property Description is passed as a parameter
argument of the ForEach statement. The results are the descriptions of active
processes.

```powershell
Get-Process | ForEach Description
```

#### The Foreach statement outside a command pipeline

The part of the Foreach statement enclosed in parenthesis represents a
variable and a collection to iterate. Windows PowerShell creates the variable
`$<item>` automatically when the Foreach loop runs. Prior to each iteration
through the loop, the variable is set to a value in the collection. The block
following a Foreach statement `{<statement list>}` contains a set of commands
to execute against each item in a collection.

##### Examples

For example, the Foreach loop in the following example displays the values in
the $letterArray array.

```powershell
$letterArray = "a","b","c","d"
foreach ($letter in $letterArray)
{
    Write-Host $letter
}
```

In this example, the $letterArray array is created and initialized with the
string values "a", "b", "c", and "d". The first time the Foreach statement
runs, it sets the $letter variable equal to the first item in $letterArray
("a"). Then, it uses the Write-Host cmdlet to display the letter a. The next
time through the loop, $letter is set to "b", and so on. After the Foreach
loop displays the letter d, Windows PowerShell exits the loop.

The entire Foreach statement must appear on a single line to run it as a
command at the Windows PowerShell command prompt. The entire Foreach
statement does not have to appear on a single line if you place the command
in a .ps1 script file instead.

Foreach statements can also be used together with cmdlets that return a
collection of items. In the following example, the Foreach statement steps
through the list of items that is returned by the Get-ChildItem cmdlet.

```powershell
foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem)
{
    Write-Host $file
}
```

You can refine the example by using an If statement to limit the results that
are returned. In the following example, the Foreach statement performs the
same looping operation as the previous example, but it adds an If statement to
limit the results to files that are greater than 100 kilobytes (KB):

```powershell
foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem)
{
   if ($file.length -gt 100KB)
   {
       Write-Host $file
   }
}
```

In this example, the Foreach loop uses a property of the $file variable to
perform a comparison operation ($file.length -gt 100KB). The $file variable
contains all the properties in the object that is returned by the
Get-ChildItem cmdlet. Therefore, you can return more than just a file name. In
the next example, Windows PowerShell returns the length and the last access
time inside the statement list:

```powershell
foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem)
{
    if ($file.length -gt 100KB)
    {
        Write-Host $file
        Write-Host $file.length
        Write-Host $file.lastaccesstime
    }
}
```

In this example, you are not limited to running a single command in a
statement list.

You can also use a variable outside a Foreach loop and increment the variable
inside the loop. The following example counts files over 100 KB in size:

```powershell
$i = 0
foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem) {
  if ($file.length -gt 100KB) {
    Write-Host $file "file size:" ($file.length / 1024).ToString("F0") KB
    $i = $i + 1
  }
}

if ($i -ne 0) {
  Write-Host
  Write-Host $i " file(s) over 100 KB in the current directory."
}
else {
  Write-Host "No files greater than 100 KB in the current directory."
}
```

In the preceding example, the \$i variable is set to 0 outside the loop, and
the variable is incremented inside the loop for each file that is found that
is larger than 100 KB. When the loop exits, an If statement evaluates the
value of $i to display a count of all the files over 100 KB. Or, it displays a
message stating that no files over 100 KB were found.

The previous example also demonstrates how to format the file length results:

```powershell
($file.length / 1024).ToString("F0")
```

The value is divided by 1,024 to show the results in kilobytes rather than
bytes, and the resulting value is then formatted using the fixed-point format
specifier to remove any decimal values from the result. The 0 makes the format
specifier show no decimal places.

#### The Foreach Statement Inside a Command Pipeline

When Foreach appears in a command pipeline, Windows PowerShell uses the
foreach alias, which calls the ForEach-Object command. When you use the
foreach alias in a command pipeline, you do not include the `($<item> in
$<collection>)` syntax as you do with the Foreach statement. This is because
the prior command in the pipeline provides this information. The syntax of the
foreach alias when used in a command pipeline is as follows:

```powershell
<command> | foreach {<command_block>}
```

For example, the Foreach loop in the following command displays processes
whose working set (memory usage) is greater than 20 megabytes (MB).

The Get-Process command gets all of the processes on the computer. The Foreach
alias performs the commands in the script block on each process in sequence.

The IF statement selects processes with a working set (WS) greater than 20
megabytes. The Write-Host cmdlet writes the name of the process followed by a
colon. It divides the working set value, which is stored in bytes by 1
megabyte to get the working set value in megabytes. Then it converts the
result from a double to a string. It displays the value as a fixed point
number with zero decimals (F0), a space separator (" "), and then "MB".

```powershell
Write-Host "Processes with working sets greater than 20 MB."
Get-Process | foreach {
   if ($_.WS -gt 20MB)
   { Write-Host $_.name ": " ($_.WS/1MB).ToString("F0") MB -Separator ""}
}
```

The foreach alias also supports beginning command blocks, middle command
blocks, and end command blocks. The beginning and end command blocks run once,
and the middle command block runs every time the Foreach loop steps through a
collection or array.

The syntax of the foreach alias when used in a command pipeline with a
beginning, middle, and ending set of command blocks is as follows:

```powershell
<command> | foreach {
    <beginning command_block>
} {
    <middle command_block>
} {
    <ending command_block>
}
```

The following example demonstrates the use of the beginning, middle, and end
command blocks.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem | foreach {
    $fileCount = $directoryCount = 0
} {
    if ($_.PsIsContainer) {$directoryCount++} else {$fileCount++}
} {
    "$directoryCount directories and $fileCount files"
}
```

The beginning block creates and initializes two variables to 0:

```powershell
{$fileCount = $directoryCount = 0}
```

The middle block evaluates whether each item returned by Get-ChildItem is a
directory or a file:

```powershell
{if ($_.PsIsContainer) {$directoryCount++} else {$fileCount++}}
```

If the item that is returned is a directory, the $directoryCount variable is
incremented by 1. If the item is not a directory, the $fileCount variable is
incremented by 1. The ending block runs after the middle block completes its
looping operation and then returns the results of the operation:

```powershell
{"$directoryCount directories and $fileCount files"}
```

By using the beginning, middle, and ending command block structure and the
pipeline operator, you can rewrite the earlier example to find any files that
are greater than 100 KB, as follows:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem | foreach {
  $i = 0} {
  if ($_.length -gt 100KB) {
    Write-Host $_.name "file size:" ($_.length / 1024).ToString("F0") KB
    $i++
  }
} {
  if ($i -ne 0) {
    Write-Host
    Write-Host "$i file(s) over 100 KB in the current directory."
  }
  else {
    Write-Host "No files greater than 100 KB in the current directory."
  }
}
```

The following example, a function which returns the functions that are used in
scripts and script modules, demonstrates how to use the MoveNext method (which
works similarly to "skip X" on a For loop) and the Current property of the
$foreach variable inside of a foreach script block, even if there are
unusually- or inconsistently-spaced function definitions that span multiple
lines to declare the function name. The example also works if there are
comments in the functions used in a script or script module.

```powershell
function Get-FunctionPosition {
  [CmdletBinding()]
  [OutputType('FunctionPosition')]
  param(
    [Parameter(Position = 0, Mandatory, ValueFromPipeline,
      ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName)]
    [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
    [Alias('PSPath')]
    [System.String[]]
    $Path
  )

  BEGIN {
    $psExtensions = @('.ps1', '.psm1')
    $prsErrorMsg = "File '{0}' has {1} parser errors."
  }

  PROCESS {
    try {
      $filesToProcess = if ($_ -is [System.IO.FileSystemInfo]) { $_ }
                        else { Get-Item -Path $Path }

      foreach ($item in $filesToProcess) {
        if ($item.PSIsContainer -or
          $item.Extension -notin $psExtensions) {
          continue
        }

        $tokens = $errors = $null
        $ast = [Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile(
            $item.FullName,
            ([REF]$tokens),
            ([REF]$errors))

        if ($errors) {
          $msg = $prsErrorMsg -f $item.FullName,$errors.Count
          Write-Warning $msg
        }

        :tokenLoop  foreach ($token in $tokens) {
          if ($token.Kind -ne 'Function') {
            continue
          }

          $position = $token.Extent.StartLineNumber
          do {
            if (-not $foreach.MoveNext()) {
              break tokenLoop
            }

            $token = $foreach.Current
          } until ($token.Kind -in @('Generic', 'Identifier'))

          $functionPosition = [pscustomobject]@{
            Name     = $token.Text
            LineNumber = $position
            Path     = $item.FullName
          }

          $params = @{
            'InputObject' = $functionPosition
            'TypeName' = 'FunctionPosition'
            'PassThru' = $true
          }

          Add-Member @params
        }
      }
    }
    catch {
      throw
    }
  }
}
```
