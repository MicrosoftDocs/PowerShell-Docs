# Remove-PSSnapin

## SYNOPSIS
Removes Windows PowerShell snap-ins from the current session.

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-PSSnapin [-Name] <String[]> [-PassThru] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Remove-PSSnapin cmdlet removes a Windows PowerShell snap-in from the current session.
You can use it to remove snap-ins that you have added to Windows PowerShell, but you cannot use it to remove the snap-ins that are installed with Windows PowerShell.

After a snap-in is removed from the current session, it is still loaded, but the cmdlets and providers in the snap-in are no longer available in the session.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```
PS C:\> remove-pssnapin -name Microsoft.Exchange
```

This command removes the Microsoft.Exchange snap-in from the current session.
When the command is complete, the cmdlets and providers that the snap-in supported are not available in the session.

### Example 2
```
PS C:\> get-PSSnapIn smp* | remove-PSSnapIn
```

This command removes the Windows PowerShell snap-ins that have names beginning with "smp" from the current session.

The command uses the Get-PSSnapin cmdlet to get objects representing the snap-ins.
The pipeline operator (|) sends the results to the Remove-PSSnapin cmdlet, which removes them from the session.
The providers and cmdlets that this snap-in supports are no longer available in the session.

When you pipe objects to Remove-PSSnapin, the names of the objects are associated with the Name parameter, which accepts objects from the pipeline that have a Name property.

### Example 3
```
PS C:\> remove-pssnapin -name *event*
```

This command removes all Windows PowerShell snap-ins that have names that include "event".
This command specifies the "Name" parameter name, but the parameter name can be omitted because it is optional.

## INPUTS

## OUTPUTS

However, if you use the PassThru parameter, it generates a System.Management.Automation.PSSnapInInfo object representing the snap-in.

## NOTES
* You can also refer to Remove-PSSnapin by its built-in alias, "rsnp". For more information, see about_Aliases.

  Remove-PSSnapin does not check the version of Windows PowerShell before removing a snap-in from the session.
If a snap-in cannot be removed, a warning appears and the command fails.

  Remove-PSSnapin affects only the current session.
If you have added an Add-PSSnapin command to your Windows PowerShell profile, you should delete the command to remove the snap-in from future sessions.
For instructions, see about_Profiles.
