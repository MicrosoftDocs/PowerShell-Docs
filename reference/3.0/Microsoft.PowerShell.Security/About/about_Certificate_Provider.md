# Certificate Provider

## Provider name

Certificate

## Drives

`Cert:`

## Capabilities

**ShouldProcess**

## Short description

Provides access to X.509 certificate stores and certificates in PowerShell.

## Detailed description

The PowerShell **Certificate** provider lets you get, add, change, clear, and delete
certificates and certificate stores in PowerShell.

Certificates are {{Fill in description}}

The **Certificate** drive is a hierarchical namespace containing the cerificate stores and certificates on your computer.

The **Certificate** provider supports the following cmdlets, which are covered
in this article.

- [Get-Location](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Location.md)
- [Set-Location](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Set-Location.md)
- [Get-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Item.md)
- [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md)
- [Invoke-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Invoke-Item.md)
- [Move-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Move-Item.md)
- [New-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/New-Item.md)
- [Remove-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Remove-Item.md)
- [Get-ItemProperty](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ItemProperty.md)
- [Set-ItemProperty](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Set-ItemProperty.md)
- [Clear-ItemProperty](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Set-ItemProperty.md)
- [Get-AuthenticodeSignature](../Get-AuthenticodeSignature.md)
- [Set-AuthenticodeSignature](../Set-AuthenticodeSignature.md)

## Types exposed by this provider

The Certificate drive exposes the following types.

- Store locations (Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.X509StoreLocation), which are
  high-level containers that group the certificates for the current user and
  for all users. Each system has a CurrentUser and LocalMachine (all users)
  store location.

- Certificates stores (System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Store), which are physical stores in which certificates are saved and managed.

- X.509 **System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2**
  certificates, each of which represent an X.509 certificate on the computer.
  Certificates are identified by their thumbprints.

## Navigating the Certificate drive

The **Certificate** provider exposes the certificate namespace as the `Cert:`
drive in PowerShell. This command uses the `Set-Location` command to change the
current location to the Root certificate store in the LocalMachine store
location. Use a backslash (\\) or a forward slash (/) to indicate a level of
the `Cert:` drive.

```powershell
Set-Location Cert:
```

You can also work with the certificate provider from any other PowerShell
drive. To reference an alias from another location, use the `Cert:` drive name
in the path.

```powershell
PS Cert:\> Set-Location -Path LocalMachine\Root
```

To return to a file system drive, type the drive name. For example, type:

```powershell
Set-Location C:
```

> [!NOTE]
> PowerShell uses aliases to allow you a familiar way to work with provider
> paths. Commands such as `dir` and `ls` are now aliases for
> [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md),
> `cd` is an alias for [Set-Location](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Set-Location.md). and `pwd` is
> an alias for [Get-Location](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Location.md).

## Displaying the Contents of the Cert: drive

New dynamic parameters, `DnsName`, `EKU`, `SSLServerAuthentication`, and
`ExpiringInDays` have been added to the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet in the `Cert:`
drive. The new dynamic parameters are available in the Windows PowerShell 3.0
and newer PowerShell releases. The provider parameters work with IIS 8.0
on Windows Server 2012 and later.

This command uses the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet to display the certificate stores
in the CurrentUser certificate store location.

If you are not in the `Cert:` drive, use an absolute path.

```powershell
PS Cert:\CurrentUser\> Get-ChildItem
```

### Displaying certificate properties within the Cert: drive

This example gets a certificate with `Get-Item` and stores it in a variable.
The example shows the new certificate script properties (**DnsNameList**,
**EnhancedKeyUsageList**, **SendAsTrustedIssuer**) using `Select-Object`.

```powershell
$c = Get-Item cert:\LocalMachine\My\52A149D0393CE8A8D4AF0B172ED667A9E3A1F44E
$c | Format-List DnsNameList, EnhancedKeyUsageList, SendAsTrustedIssuer
```

```output
DnsNameList          : {SERVER01.contoso.com}
EnhancedKeyUsageList : {WiFi-Machine (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.42.2.6),
                       Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2)}
SendAsTrustedIssuer  : False
```

### Find all CodeSigning certificates

This command uses the **CodeSigningCert** and **Recurse** parameters of the
`Get-ChildItem` cmdlet to get all of the certificates on the computer that have
code-signing authority.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path cert: -CodeSigningCert -Recurse
```

### Find expired certificates

This command uses the **ExpiringInDays** parameter of the `Get-ChildItem`
cmdlet to get certificates that will expire within the next 30 days.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\WebHosting -ExpiringInDays 30
```

### Find Server SSL Certificates

This command uses the **SSLServerAuthentication** parameter of the
`Get-ChildItem` cmdlet to get all Server SSL Certificates in the My and
WebHosting stores.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My, cert:\LocalMachine\WebHosting `
  -SSLServerAuthentication
```

### Find expired certificates on remote computers

This command uses the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet to run a `Get-ChildItem` command
on the Srv01 and Srv02 computers. A value of zero (0) in the **ExpiringInDays**
parameter gets certificates on the Srv01 and Srv02 computers that have expired.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName Srv01, Srv02 {Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\* `
  -Recurse -ExpiringInDays 0}
```

### Combining filters to find a specific set of certificates

This command gets all certificates in the LocalMachine store location that have
the following attributes:

- "fabrikam" in their DNS name
- "Client Authentication" in their EKU
- a value of `$true` for the **SendAsTrustedIssuer** property
- do not expire within the next 30 days.

The **NotAfter** property stores the certificate expiration date.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\* -Recurse -DNSName "*fabrikam*" `
  -EKU "*Client Authentication*" | Where-Object {
                                     $_.SendAsTrustedIssuer -and `
                                     $_.NotAfter -gt (get-date).AddDays.(30)
                                   }
```

## Opening the Certificates MMC Snap-in

The `Invoke-Item` cmdlet will use the default application to open a path
you specify. For certificates, the default application is the Certificates MMC
snap-in.

This command opens the Certificates MMC snap-in to manage the specified
certificate.

```powershell
Invoke-Item cert:\CurrentUser\my\6B8223358119BB08840DEE50FD8AF9EA776CE66B
```

## Copying Certificates

Copying certificates is not supported by the **Certificate** provider. When
you attempt to copy a certificate, you see this error.

```
$path = "Cert:\LocalMachine\Root\E2C0F6662D3C569705B4B31FE2CBF3434094B254"
PS Cert:\LocalMachine\> Copy-Item -Path $path -Destination .\CA\
Copy-Item : Provider operation stopped because the provider does not support
this operation.
At line:1 char:1
+ Copy-Item -Path $path -Destination .\CA\
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotImplemented: (:) [Copy-Item],
                              PSNotSupportedException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NotSupported,
                              Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.CopyItemCommand
```

## Moving Certificates

### Move all SSL Server authentication certs to the WebHosting store

This command uses the `Move-Item` cmdlet to move a certificate from the My
store to the WebHosting store.

`Move-Item` will not move certificate stores and it will not move certificates
to a different store location, such as moving a certificate from LocalMachine
to CurrentUser. The `Move-Item` cmdlet moves certificates, but it does not move
private keys.

This command uses the **SSLServerAuthentication** parameter of the
`Get-ChildItem` cmdlet to get SSL server authentication certificates in the MY
certificate store.

The returned certificates are piped to the `Move-Item` cmdlet, which moves
the certificates to the WebHosting store.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem cert:\LocalMachine\My -SSLServerAuthentication | Move-Item `
  -Destination cert:\LocalMachine\WebHosting
```

## Deleting Certificates and Private Keys

The `Remove-Item` cmdlet will remove certificates that you specify. The
`-DeleteKey` dynamic parameter deletes the private key.

### Delete a Certificate from the CA store

This command deletes a certificate from the CA certificate store, but leaves
the associated private key intact.

In the `Cert:` drive, the `Remove-Item` cmdlet supports only the **DeleteKey**,
**Path**, **WhatIf**, and **Confirm** parameters. All other parameters are
ignored.

```powershell
Remove-Item cert:\LocalMachine\CA\5DDC44652E62BF9AA1116DC41DE44AB47C87BDD0
```

### Delete a Certificate using a wildcards in the DNS name

This command deletes all certificates that have a DNS name that contains
"Fabrikam". It uses the **DNSName** parameter of the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet to
get the certificates and the `Remove-Item` cmdlet to delete them.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine -DnsName *Fabrikam* | Remove-Item
```

### Delete private keys from a remote computer

This series of commands enables delegation and then deletes the certificate and
associated private key on a remote computer. To delete a private key on a
remote computer, you must use delegated credentials.

Use the `Enable-WSManCredSSP` cmdlet to enable Credential Security Service
Provider (CredSSP) authentication on a client on the S1 remote computer.
CredSSP permits delegated authentication.

```powershell
Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role Client -DelegateComputer S1
```

Use the `Connect-WSMan` cmdlet to connect the S1 computer to the WinRM service on
the local computer. When this command completes, the S1 computer appears in the
local `WSMan:` drive in PowerShell.

```powershell
Connect-WSMan -ComputerName S1 -Credential Domain01\Admin01
```

Now, you can use the Set-Item cmdlet in the WSMan: drive to enable the CredSSP
attribute for the WinRM service.

```powershell
Set-Item -Path WSMan:\S1\Service\Auth\CredSSP -Value $true
```

Start a remote session on the s1 computer using the `New-PSSession` cmdlet, and
specify CredSSP authentication. Saves the session in the `$s` variable.

```powershell
$s  = New-PSSession S1 -Authentication CredSSP -Credential Domain01\Admin01
```

Finally, use the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet to run a `Remove-Item` command in the
session in the `$s` variable. The `Remove-Item` command uses the **DeleteKey**
parameter to remove the private key along with the specified certificate.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -Session $s { Remove-Item `
  -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My\D2D38EBA60CAA1C12055A2E1C83B15AD450110C2 `
  -DeleteKey
  }
```

### Delete expired Certificates

This command uses the **ExpiringInDays** parameter of the `Get-ChildItem`
cmdlet with a value of 0 to get certificates in the WebHosting store that have
expired.

The variable containing the returned certificates is piped to the
`Remove-Item` cmdlet, which deletes them. The command uses the **DeleteKey**
parameter to delete the private key along with the certificate.

```powershell
$expired = Get-ChildItem cert:\LocalMachine\WebHosting -ExpiringInDays 0
$expired | Remove-Item -DeleteKey
```

## Creating Certificates

The `New-Item` cmdlet does not create new certificates in the **Certificate**
provider. Use the [New-SelfSignedCertificate](/powershell/module/pkiclient/new-selfsignedcertificate) cmdlet to create a certificate
for testing purposes.  

## Creating Certificate Stores

In the Cert: drive, the `New-Item` cmdlet creates certificate stores in the
LocalMachine store location. It supports the **Name**, **Path**, **WhatIf**,
and **Confirm** parameters. All other parameters are ignored. The command
returns a **System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Store**
that represents the new certificate store.

This command creates a new certificate store named "CustomStore" in the
LocalMachine store location.

```powershell
New-Item -Path cert:\LocalMachine\CustomStore
```

### Create a new certificate store on a remote computer

This command creates a new certificate store named "HostingStore" in the
LocalMachine store location on the Server01 computer.

The command uses the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet to run a `New-Item` command on the
Server01 computer. The command returns a
**System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Store** that represents
the new certificate store.

```powershell
Invoke-Command { New-Item -Path cert:\LocalMachine\CustomStore } `
  -ComputerName Server01
```

## Creating Client Certificates for WS-Man

This command creates **ClientCertificate** entry that can be used by the
**WS-Management** client. The new **ClientCertificate** will show up under the
**ClientCertificate** directory as "ClientCertificate_1234567890". All of the
parameters are mandatory. The **Issuer** needs to be thumbprint of the issuers
certificate.

```powershell
$cred = Get-Credential
New-Item -Path WSMan:\localhost\ClientCertificate `
         -Issuer 1b3fd224d66c6413fe20d21e38b304226d192dfe `
         -URI wmicimv2/* -Credential $cred
```

## Deleting Certificate Stores

### Delete a certificate store from a remote computer

This command uses the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet to run a `Remove-Item` command on
the S1 and S2 computers. The `Remove-Item` command includes the **Recurse**
parameter, which deletes the certificates in the store before it deletes the
store.

```powershell
Invoke-Command { Remove-Item -Path cert:\LocalMachine\TestStore -Recurse } `
  -ComputerName S1, S2
```

## Dynamic parameters

Dynamic parameters are cmdlet parameters that are added by a PowerShell
provider and are available only when the cmdlet is being used in the
provider-enabled drive. These parameters are valid in all subdirectories of the
Certificate provider, but are effective only on certificates.

> [!NOTE]
> Parameters that perform filtering against the `EnhancedKeyUsageList` property
> also return items with an empty `EnhancedKeyUsageList` property value.
> Certificates that have an empty **EnhancedKeyUsageList** can be used for
> all purposes.

### CodeSigningCert <System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter>

#### Cmdlets supported

- [Get-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Item.md)

- [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md)

This parameter gets certificates that have "Code Signing" in their
**EnhancedKeyUsageList** property value.

### DnsName <Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.DnsNameRepresentation>

#### Cmdlets supported

- [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md)

This parameter gets certificates that have the specified domain name or name
pattern in the **DNSNameList** property of the certificate. The value of this
parameter can either be "Unicode" or "ASCII". Punycode values are converted to
Unicode. Wildcard characters (*) are permitted.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

### EKU <System.String>

#### Cmdlets supported

- [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md)

This parameter gets certificates that have the specified text or text pattern
in the `EnhancedKeyUsageList` property of the certificate. Wildcard characters
(*) are permitted. The `EnhancedKeyUsageList` property contains the friendly
name and the OID fields of the EKU.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

### ExpiringInDays <System.Int32>

#### Cmdlets supported

- [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md)

This parameter gets certificates that are expiring in or before the specified
number of days. A value of 0 (zero) gets certificates that have expired.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

### SSLServerAuthentication <System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter>

#### Cmdlets supported

- [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md)

Gets only server certificates for SSL web hosting. This parameter gets
certificates that have "Server Authentication" in their `EnhancedKeyUsageList`
property value.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

### DeleteKey <System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter>

#### Cmdlets supported

- [Remove-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Remove-Item.md)

This parameter deletes the associated private key when it deletes the certificate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To delete a private key that is associated with a user certificate in the
> `Cert:\CurrentUser` store on a remote computer, you must use delegated
> credentials. The `Invoke-Command` cmdlet supports credential delegation
> using the **CredSSP** parameter. You should consider any security risks
> before using `Remove-Item` with `Invoke-Command` and credential delegation.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

## Script properties

New script properties have been added to the **x509Certificate2** object that
represents the certificates to make it easy to search and manage the
certificates.

- `DnsNameList`: To populate the `DnsNameList` property, the Certificate
  provider copies the content from the DNSName entry in the
  SubjectAlternativeName (SAN) extension. If the SAN extension is empty, the
  property is populated with content from the Subject field of the certificate.

- `EnhancedKeyUsageList`: To populate the `EnhancedKeyUsageList` property, the
  Certificate provider copies the OID properties of the EnhancedKeyUsage (EKU)
  field in the certificate and creates a friendly name for it.

- `SendAsTrustedIssuer`: {{Fill in description https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.powershell.commands.sendastrustedissuerproperty?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=powershellsdk-1.1.0}}

These new features let you search for certificates based on their DNS names and
expiration dates, and distinguish client and server authentication certificates
by the value of their Enhanced Key Usage (EKU) properties.

## Using the pipeline

Provider cmdlets accept pipeline input. You can use the pipeline to simplify
task by sending provider data from one cmdlet to another provider cmdlet.
To read more about how to use the pipeline with provider cmdlets, see the
cmdlet references provided throughout this article.

## Getting help

Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, you can get customized help topics for
provider cmdlets that explain how those cmdlets behave in a file system drive.

To get the help topics that are customized for the file system drive, run a
[Get-Help](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/Get-Help.md) command in a file system drive or use the `-Path`
parameter of [Get-Help](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/Get-Help.md) to specify a file system drive.

```powershell
Get-Help Get-ChildItem
```

```powershell
Get-Help Get-ChildItem -Path cert:
```
