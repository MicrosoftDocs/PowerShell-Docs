# About Operators

## SHORT DESCRIPTION

Describes the operators that are supported by PowerShell.

## LONG DESCRIPTION

An operator is a language element that you can use in a command or
expression. PowerShell supports several types of operators to help you
manipulate values.

### Arithmetic Operators

Use arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) to calculate values in a
command or expression. With these operators, you can add, subtract,
multiply, or divide values, and calculate the remainder (modulus) of a
division operation.

You can also use arithmetic operators with strings, arrays, and hash
tables. The addition operator concatenates elements. The multiplication
operator returns the specified number of copies of each element.

For more information, see [about_Arithmetic_Operators](about_Arithmetic_Operators.md).

### Assignment Operators

Use assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`) to assign one
or more values to variables, to change the values in a variable, and to
append values to variables. You can also cast the variable as any Microsoft
.NET Framework data type, such as string or DateTime, or Process variable.

For more information, see [about_Assignment_Operators](about_Assignment_Operators.md).

### Comparison Operators

Use comparison operators (`-eq`, `-ne`, `-gt`, `-lt`, `-le`, `-ge`) to
compare values and test conditions. For example, you can compare two string
values to determine whether they are equal.

The comparison operators include the match operators (`-match`,
`-notmatch`), which find patterns by using regular expressions; the replace
operator (`-replace`), which uses regular expressions to change input
values; the like operators (`-like`, `-notlike`), which find patterns using
wildcard characters (`*`); and the containment operators (`-in`, `-notin`,
`-contains`, `-notcontains`), which determine whether a test value appears
in a reference set.

They also include the bitwise operators (`-bAND`, `-bOR`, `-bXOR`, `-bNOT`)
to manipulate the bit patterns in values.

For more information, see [about_Comparison_Operators](about_Comparison_Operators.md).

### Logical Operators

Use logical operators (`-and`, `-or`, `-xor`, `-not`, `!`) to connect
conditional statements into a single complex conditional. For example, you
can use a logical `-and` operator to create an object filter with two
different conditions.

For more information, see [about_Logical_Operators](about_logical_operators.md).

### Redirection Operators

Use redirection operators (`>`, `>>`, `2>`, `2>>`, and `2>&1`) to send the
output of a command or expression to a text file. The redirection operators
work like the `Out-File` cmdlet (without parameters) but they also let you
redirect error output to specified files. You can also use the `Tee-Object`
cmdlet to redirect output.

For more information, see [about_Redirection](about_Redirection.md)

### Split and Join Operators

The `-split` and `-join` operators divide and combine substrings. The
`-split` operator splits a string into substrings. The `-join` operator
concatenates multiple strings into a single string.

For more information, see [about_Split](about_Split.md) and
[about_Join](about_Join.md).

### Type Operators

Use the type operators (`-is`, `-isnot`, `-as`) to find or change the .NET
Framework type of an object.

For more information, see [about_Type_Operators](about_Type_Operators.md).

### Unary Operators

Use unary operators to increment or decrement variables or object
properties and to set integers to positive or negative numbers. For
example, to increment the variable `$a` from `9` to `10`, you type `$a++`.

### Special Operators

Use special operators to perform tasks that cannot be performed by the
other types of operators. For example, special operators allow you to
perform operations such as running commands and changing a value's data
type.

`@( )` Array subexpression operator

Returns the result of one or more statements as an array. If there is only
one item, the array has only one member.

```powershell
@(Get-WmiObject win32_logicalDisk)
```

`&` Call operator

Runs a command, script, or script block. The call operator, also known as
the "invocation operator," lets you run commands that are stored in
variables and represented by strings. Because the call operator does not
parse the command, it cannot interpret command parameters.

```powershell
$c = "get-executionpolicy"
$c

# get-executionpolicy

& $c

# AllSigned
```

`[ ]` Cast operator

Converts or limits objects to the specified type. If the objects cannot be
converted, PowerShell generates an error.

```powershell
[datetime]$birthday = "1/20/88"
[int64]$a = 34
```

`,` Comma operator

As a binary operator, the comma creates an array. As a unary operator, the
comma creates an array with one member. Place the comma before the member.

```powershell
$myArray = 1,2,3
$SingleArray = ,1
```

`.` Dot sourcing operator

Runs a script in the current scope so that any functions, aliases, and
variables that the script creates are added to the current scope.

```powershell
. c:\scripts.sample.ps1
```

> [!NOTE]
> The dot sourcing operator is followed by a space. Use the space to
> distinguish the dot from the dot (`.`) symbol that represents the current
> directory.

In the following example, the Sample.ps1 script in the current directory is
run in the current scope.

```powershell
. .\sample.ps1
```

`-f` Format operator

Formats strings by using the format method of string objects. Enter the
format string on the left side of the operator and the objects to be
formatted on the right side of the operator.

```powershell
"{0} {1,-10} {2:N}" -f 1,"hello",[math]::pi

# 1 hello      3.14
```

For more information, see the [String.Format](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=166450)
method and [Composite Formatting](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=166451).

`[ ]` Index operator

Selects objects from indexed collections, such as arrays and hash tables.
Array indexes are zero-based, so the first object is indexed as `[0]`. For
arrays (only), you can also use negative indexes to get the last values.
Hash tables are indexed by key value.

```powershell
$a = 1, 2, 3
$a[0]

# 1

$a[-1]

# 3
```

```powershell
(Get-HotFix | Sort-Object installedOn)[-1]
```

```powershell
$h = @{key="value"; name="PowerShell"; version="2.0"}
$h["name"]

# PowerShell
```

```powershell
$x = [xml]"<doc><intro>Once upon a time...</intro></doc>"
$x["doc"]

# intro
# -----
# Once upon a time...
```

`|` Pipeline operator

Sends ("pipes") the output of the command that precedes it to the command
that follows it. When the output includes more than one object (a
"collection"), the pipeline operator sends the objects one at a time.

```powershell
Get-Process | Get-Member
Get-PSSnapin | Where-Object {$_.vendor -ne "Microsoft"}
```

`.` Property dereference operator

Accesses the properties and methods of an object.

```powershell
$myProcess.peakWorkingSet
(Get-Process PowerShell).kill()
```

`..` Range operator

Represents the sequential integers in an integer array, given an upper and
lower boundary.

```powershell
1..10
10..1
foreach ($a in 1..$max) {Write-Host $a}
```

`::` Static member operator

Calls the static properties operator and methods of a .NET Framework class.
To find the static properties and methods of an object, use the Static
parameter of the `Get-Member` cmdlet.

```powershell
[datetime]::now
```

`$( )` Subexpression operator

Returns the result of one or more statements. For a single result, returns
a scalar. For multiple results, returns an array.

```powershell
$($x * 23)
$(Get-WmiObject win32_Directory)
```
