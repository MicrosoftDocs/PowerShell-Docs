# About Regular Expressions

## Short description
Describes regular expressions in Windows PowerShell.

## Long description

A regular expression is a pattern used to match text. It can be made up of
literal characters, operators, and other constructs.

This article demonstrates regular expression syntax in PowerShell. PowerShell
has several operators and cmdlets that use regular expressions. You can read
more about their syntax and usage at the links below.

- [Select-String](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Select-String.md)
- [-match and -replace operators](about_Comparison_Operators.md)
- [-split](about_Split.md)
- [switch statement with -regex option](about_Switch.md)

PowerShell regular expressions are case-insensitive by default. Each method
shown above has a different way to force case sensitivity.

|Method  |Case Sensitivity  |
|---------|---------|
|`Select-String`|use `-CaseSensitive` switch|
|`switch` statement |use the `-casesensitive` option|
|operators|prefix with **'c'** (`-cmatch`, `-csplit`, or `-creplace`)|

### Character literals

A regular expression can be a literal character or a string.
This causes the engine to match the text specified exactly.

```powershell
# This statement returns true because book contains the string "oo"
"book" -match "oo"
```

### Character classes

While character literals work if you know the exact pattern, character
classes allow you to be less specific.

#### Character groups

`[character group]` allows you to match any number of characters one time,
while `[^character group]` only matches characters NOT in the group.

```powershell
# This expression returns true if the pattern matches big, bog, or bug.
"big" -match "b[iou]g"
```

#### Character ranges

A pattern can also be a range of characters. This can be alphabetic
`[A-Z]`, numeric `[0-9]`, or even ASCII-based `[ -~]` (all printable
characters).

```powershell
# This expression returns true if the pattern matches any 2 digit number.
42 -match "[0-9][0-9]"
```

#### Numbers

The `\d` character class will match any decimal digit.  Conversely, `\D`
will match any non-decimal digit.

```powershell
# This expression returns true if it matches a server name.
# (Server-01 - Server-99).
"Server-01" -match "Server-\d\d"
```

#### Word characters

The `\w` character class will match any word character `[a-zA-Z_0-9]`.
To match any non-word character, use `\W`.

```powershell
# This expression returns true.
# The pattern matches the first word character 'B'.
"Book" -match "\w"
```

#### Wildcards

The period (`.`) is a wildcard character in regular expressions. It will
match any character except a newline (`\n`).

```powershell
# This expression returns true.
# The pattern matches any 4 characters except the newline.
"a1\ " -match "...."
```

#### Whitespace

Whitespace is matched using the `\s` character class.  Any non-whitespace
character is matched using `\S`. Literal space characters `' '` can also be
used.

```powershell
# This expression returns true.
# The pattern uses both methods to match the space.
" - " -match "\s- "
```

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers control how many instances of each element should be present in
the input string.

These are a few of the quantifiers are available in PowerShell.

|Quantifier  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|`*`|Zero or more times.|
|`+`|One or more times.|
|`?`|Zero or one time.|
|`{n,m}`|At least `n`, but no more than `m` times.|

The asterisk `*` matches the previous element Zero or more times. This means
that even an input string without the element would be a match.

```powershell
# This returns true for all account name strings even if the name is absent.
"ACCOUNT NAME:    Administrator" -match "ACCOUNT NAME:\s*\w*"
```

The plus sign `+` matches the previous element One or more times.

```powershell
# This returns true if it matches any server name.
"DC-01" -match "[A-Z]+-\d\d"
```

The question mark `?` matches the previous element zero or one time. Like
asterisk `*`, it will even match strings where the element is absent.

```powershell
# This returns true for any server name, even ones without dashes.
"SERVER01" -match "[A-Z]+-?\d\d"
```

The `{n, m}` quantifier can be used several different ways to allow granular
control over the quantifier. The second element `m` and the comma `,` are
optional.

|Quantifier  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|`{n}`|Match EXACTLY `n` number of times.|
|`{n,}`|Match at LEAST `n` number of times.|
|`{n,m}`|Match between `n` and `m` number of times.|

```powershell
# This returns true if it matches any phone number.
"111-222-3333" -match "\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}"
```

### Anchors

Anchors allow you to cause a match to succeed or fail based on the matches
position within the input string.

The two commonly used anchors are `^` and `$`. The carat `^` matches the
start of a string, and `$`, which matches the end of a string. This allows
you to match your text at a specific position while also discarding unwanted
characters.

```powershell
# The pattern expects the 'h' to be followed by the end of the word.
# This will return FALSE.
"fishing" -match "^fish$"
```

When using anchors in powershell, you should understand the difference
between **Singleline** and **Multiline** regular expression options.

- **Multiline**: Multiline mode forces `^` and `$` to match the beginning
  end of every LINE instead of the beginning and end of the input string.
- **Singleline**: Singleline mode treats the input string as a *SingleLine*.
  It forces the `.` character to match every character (including newlines),
  instead of matching every character EXCEPT the newline `\n`.

To read more about these options and how to use them, visit the
[Regular Expression Language - Quick Reference](/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference).

### Escaping characters

The backslash `\` is used to escape characters so they are not parsed by the
regular expression engine.

The following characters are reserved: `[]().\^$|?*+{}`.

You will need to escape these characters in your patterns to match
them in your input strings.

```powershell
# This returns true and matches numbers with at least 2 digits of precision.
# The decimal point is escaped using the backslash.
"3.141" -match "3\.\d{2,}"
```

There`s a static method of the regex class that can escape text for you.

```powershell
[regex]::escape("3.\d{2,}")
```

```output
3\.\\d\{2,}
```

> [!NOTE]
> This escapes all reserved regular expression characters, including
> existing backslashes used in character classes.  Be sure to only use it on
> the portion of your pattern that you need to escape.

#### Other character escapes

There are also reserved character escapes that you can use to match special
character types.

The following are a few commonly used character escapes.

|Character Escape  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|`\t`|Matches a tab|
|`\n`|Matches a newline|
|`\r`|Matches a carriage return|

### Groups, Captures, and Substitutions

Grouping constructs separate a input string into substrings that can be
captured or ignored. Grouped substrings are called subexpressions. By default
subexpressions are captured in numbered groups, though you can assign names
to them as well.

A grouping construct is a regular expression surrounded by
parenthesis. Any text matched by the by the enclosed regular expression is
captured. The following example will break the input text into two capturing
groups.

```powershell
"The last logged on user was CONTOSO\jsmith" -match "(.+was )(.+)"
True
```

Use the `$Matches` **Hashtable** automatic variable to retrieve
captured text. The text representing the entire match is stored at key `0`.

```powershell
$Matches.0
The last logged on user was CONTOSO\jsmith
```

Captures are stored in numeric **Integer** keys that increase from left to
right. Capture `1` contains all the text until the username, capture `2`
contains just the username.

```powershell
$Matches

Name                           Value
----                           -----
2                              CONTOSO\jsmith
1                              The last logged on user was
0                              The last logged on user was CONTOSO\jsmith
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `0` key is an **Integer**. You can use any **Hashtable** method to access
> the value stored.
>
> ```powershell
> PS> "Good Dog" -matches "Dog"
> True
>
> PS> $Matches[0]
> Dog
>
> PS> $Matches.Item(0)
> Dog
>
> PS> $Matches.0
> Dog
> ```

#### Named Captures

By default, captures are stored in ascending numeric order, from left to right.
You can also assign a *name* to a capturing group. This *name* becomes a key
on the `$Matches` **Hashtable** automatic variable.

Inside a capturing group, use `?<keyname>` to store captured data under
a named key.

```powershell
PS> $string = "The last logged on user was CONTOSO\jsmith"
PS> $string -match "was (?<domain>.+)\\(?<user>.+)"
True

PS> $Matches

Name                           Value
----                           -----
domain                         CONTOSO
user                           jsmith
0                              was CONTOSO\jsmith

PS> $Matches.domain
CONTOSO

PS> $Matches.user
jsmith
```

The following example stores the latest **SuccessAudit** from the Windows
Security Log. The provided regular expression extracts the username and
domain from the message and stores them under **N** and **D** keys for
*name* and *domain*.

```powershell
$log = (Get-EventLog -LogName Security -Newest 1 -InstanceId 4689).message
$r = '(?s).*Account Name:\s*(?<N>.*).*Account Domain:\s*(?<D>[A-Z,0-9]*)'
$log -match $r
```

```output
True
```

```powershell
$Matches
```

```output
Name                           Value
----                           -----
D                              CONTOSO
N                              jsmith
0                              A process has exited....
```

#### Substitutions in Regular Expressions

Using the regular expressions with the `-replace` operator allows you to
dynamically replace text using captured text. Capturing groups can be
referenced in the \<substitute\> string. This is done by using the `$`
character before the group identifier.

`<input> -replace <original>, <substitute>`

Two of the ways to reference capturing groups is by **Number** and by **Name**

- By **Number** -
  Capturing Groups are numbered from left to right.

  ```powershell
  "John D. Smith" -replace "(\w+) (\w+)\. (\w+)", '$1.$2.$3@contoso.com'
  ```

  ```output
  John.D.Smith@contoso.com
  ```

- By **Name** -
  Capturing Groups can also be referenced by name.

  ```powershell
  "CONTOSO\Administrator" -replace '\w+\\(?<user>\w+)', 'FABRIKAM\${user}'
  ```

  ```output
  FABRIKAM\Administrator
  ```

The `$&` expression represents all of the text matched.

```powershell
"Gobble" -replace "Gobble", "$& $&"
```

```output
Gobble Gobble
```

> [!WARNING]
> Since the `$` character is used in string expansion, you will need to use
> literal strings with substitution, or escape the `$` character.
> ```powershell
> 'Hello World' -replace '(\w+) \w+', "`$1 Universe"
> ```
>
> ```output
> Hello Universe
> ```
>
> Additionally, sicne the `$` character is used in substitution, you will need
> to escape any instances in your string.
>
> ```powershell
> '5.72' -replace '(.+)', '$$$1'
> ```
> ```output
> $5.72
> ```
