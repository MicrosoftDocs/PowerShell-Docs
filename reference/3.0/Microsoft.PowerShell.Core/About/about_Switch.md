# About Switch

## SHORT DESCRIPTION

Explains how to use a switch to handle multiple If statements.

## LONG DESCRIPTION

To check a condition in a script or function, use an If statement. The If
can check many types of conditions, including the value of variables and
the properties of objects.

To check multiple conditions, use a Switch statement. The Switch statement
is equivalent to a series of If statements, but it is simpler. The Switch
statement lists each condition and an optional action. If a condition
obtains, the action is performed.

A basic Switch statement has the following format:

```powershell
Switch (<test-value>)
{
    <condition> {<action>}
    <condition> {<action>}
}
```

For example, the following Switch statement compares the test value, 3, to
each of the conditions. When the test value matches the condition, the
action is performed.

```powershell
PS> switch (3)
 {
    1 {"It is one."}
    2 {"It is two."}
    3 {"It is three."}
    4 {"It is four."}
 }
It is three.
```

In this simple example, the value is compared to each condition in the
list, even though there is a match for the value 3. The following Switch
statement has two conditions for a value of 3. It demonstrates that, by
default, all conditions are tested.

```powershell
PS> switch (3)
 {
    1 {"It is one."}
    2 {"It is two."}
    3 {"It is three."}
    4 {"It is four."}
    3 {"Three again."}
 }
It is three.
Three again.
```

To direct the Switch to stop comparing after a match, use the Break
statement. The Break statement terminates the Switch statement.

```powershell
PS> switch (3)
 {
    1 {"It is one."}
    2 {"It is two."}
    3 {"It is three."; Break}
    4 {"It is four."}
    3 {"Three again."}
 }
It is three.
```

If the test value is a collection, such as an array, each item in the
collection is evaluated in the order in which it appears. The following
examples evaluates 4 and then 2.

```powershell
PS> switch (4, 2)
 {
    1 {"It is one." }
    2 {"It is two." }
    3 {"It is three." }
    4 {"It is four." }
    3 {"Three again."}
 }
It is four.
It is two.
```

Any Break statements apply to the collection, not to each value, as shown
in the following example. The Switch statement is terminated by the Break
statement in the condition of value 4.

```powershell
PS> switch (4, 2)
 {
    1 {"It is one."; Break}
    2 {"It is two." ; Break }
    3 {"It is three." ; Break }
    4 {"It is four." ; Break }
    3 {"Three again."}
 }
It is four.
```

### SYNTAX

The complete Switch statement syntax is as follows:

```powershell
switch [-regex|-wildcard|-exact][-casesensitive] (<value>)
{
    "string"|number|variable|{ expression } { statementlist }
    default { statementlist }
}
```

or

```powershell
switch [-regex|-wildcard|-exact][-casesensitive] -file filename
{
    "string"|number|variable|{ expression } { statementlist }
    default { statementlist }
}
```

If no parameters are used, Switch performs a case-insensitive exact match
for the value. If the value is a collection, each element is evaluated in
the order in which it appears.

The Switch statement must include at least one condition statement.

The Default clause is triggered when the value does not match any of the
conditions. It is equivalent to an Else clause in an If statement. Only one
Default clause is permitted in each Switch statement.

Switch has the following parameters:

|Parameter    |Description                                                |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|Wildcard     |Indicates that the condition is a wildcard string. If you  |
|             |you use Wildcard, Regex and Exact are ignored. Also, if    |
|             |the match clause is not a string, the parameter is ignored.|
|Exact        |Indicates that the match clause, if it is a string, must   |
|             |match exactly. Regex and Wildcard are ignored.             |
|             |Also, if the match clause is not a string, this parameter  |
|             |is ignored.                                                |
|CaseSensitive|Performs a case-sensitive match. If the match clause is not|
|             |a string, this parameter is ignored.                       |
|File         |Takes input from a file rather than a value statement. If  |
|             |multiple File parameters are included, only the last one is|
|             |used. Each line of the file is read and evaluated by the   |
|             |Switch statement.                                          |
|Regex        |Performs regular expression matching of the value to the   |
|             |condition. Wildcard and Exact are ignored. Also, if the    |
|             |match clause is not a string, this parameter is ignored.   |

In this example, there is no matching case so there is no output.

```powershell
   PS> switch ("fourteen")
       {
           1 {"It is one."; Break}
           2 {"It is two."; Break}
           3 {"It is three."; Break}
           4 {"It is four."; Break}
           "fo*" {"That's too many."}
       }
```

For the word "fourteen" to match a case you must use the **-Wildcard** or
**-Regex** parameter.

```powershell
   PS> switch -Wildcard ("fourteen")
       {
           1 {"It is one."; Break}
           2 {"It is two."; Break}
           3 {"It is three."; Break}
           4 {"It is four."; Break}
           "fo*" {"That's too many."}
       }
 ```

 Result:

 ```Output
That's too many.
```

The following example uses the **-Regex** parameter.

```powershell
$target = 'user@contoso.com'
switch -Regex ($target)
{
    'ftp\://.*' { "$_ is an ftp address"; Break }
    '\w+@\w+\.com|edu|org' { "$_ is an email address"; Break }
    'http[s]?\://.*' { "$_ is a web address"; Break }
}
```

Result:

```output
user@contoso.com is an email address
```

Multiple instances of Regex, Wildcard, or Exact are permitted. However,
only the last parameter used is effective.

If the value matches multiple conditions, the action for each condition is
executed. To change this behavior, use the Break or Continue keywords.

The Break keyword stops processing and exits the Switch statement.

The Continue keyword stops processing the current value, but continues
processing any subsequent values.

If the condition is an expression or a script block, it is evaluated just
before it is compared to the value. The value is assigned to the `$_`
automatic variable and is available in the expression. The match succeeds
if the expression is true or matches the value. The expression is evaluated
in its own scope.

The "Default" keyword specifies a condition that is evaluated only when no
other conditions match the value.

The action for each condition is independent of the actions in other
conditions.
