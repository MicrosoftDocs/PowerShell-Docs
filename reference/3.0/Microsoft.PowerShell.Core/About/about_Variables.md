# About Variables

## SHORT DESCRIPTION
Describes how variables store values that can be used in PowerShell.

## LONG DESCRIPTION

You can store all types of values in PowerShell variables. They are typically
used to store the results of commands and to store elements that are used in
commands and expressions, such as names, paths, settings, and values.

A variable is a unit of memory in which values are stored. In PowerShell,
variables are represented by text strings that begin with a dollar sign (`$`),
such as `$a`, `$process`, or `$my_var`.

Variable names are not case-sensitive. Variable names can include spaces and
special characters, but these are difficult to use and should be avoided.

There are several different types of variables in PowerShell.

- User-created variables: User-created variables are created and maintained by
  the user. By default, the variables that you create at the PowerShell command
  line exist only while the PowerShell window is open, and they are lost when
  you close the window. To save a variable, add it to your PowerShell profile.
  You can also create variables in scripts with global, script, or local scope.

- Automatic variables: Automatic variables store the state of PowerShell. These
  variables are created by PowerShell, and PowerShell changes their values as
  required to maintain their accuracy. Users cannot change the value of these
  variables. For example, the `$PSHome` variable stores the path to the
  PowerShell installation directory.

  For more information, a list, and a description of the automatic
  variables, see [about_Automatic_Variables](about_Automatic_Variables.md).

- Preference variables: Preference variables store user preferences for
  PowerShell. These variables are created by PowerShell and are populated with
  default values. Users can change the values of these variables. For example,
  the `$MaximumHistoryCount` variable determines the maximum number of entries
  in the session history.

  For more information, a list, and a description of the preference variables,
  see [about_Preference_Variables](about_Preference_Variables.md).

### WORKING WITH VARIABLES

To create a new variable, use an assignment statement to assign a value to the
variable. You do not have to declare the variable before using it. The default
value of all variables is `$null`.

For example:

```powershell
PS> $MyVariable = 1, 2, 3

PS> $path = "C:\Windows\System32"
```

Variables are very useful for storing the results of commands.

For example:

```powershell
PS> $processes = Get-Process

PS> $Today = (Get-Date).date
```

To display the value of a variable, type the variable name, preceded by a
dollar sign (`$`).

For example:

```powershell
PS> $MyVariable
1
2
3

PS> $Today
Thursday, September 03, 2009 12:00:00 AM
```

To change the value of a variable, assign a new value to the variable.

The following examples displays the value of the `$MyVariable` variable,
changes the value of the variable, and then displays the new value.

```powershell
PS> $MyVariable
1
2
3

PS> $MyVariable = "The green cat."

PS> $MyVariable
The green cat.
```

To delete the value of a variable, use the `Clear-Variable` cmdlet or change
the value to `$null`.

```powershell
PS> Clear-Variable -name MyVariable

-or-

PS> $MyVariable = $null
```

To delete the variable, use the `Remove-Variable` or `Remove-Item` cmdlets.
These cmdlets are discussed later in this topic.

```powershell
PS> Remove-Variable -name MyVariable

PS> Remove-Item -path Variable:\MyVariable
```

To get a list of all the variables in your  PowerShell session, type:

```powershell
Get-Variable
```

### TYPES OF VARIABLES

You can store any type of object in a variable, including integers, strings,
arrays, hash tables, and objects that represent processes, services, event
logs, and computers.

PowerShell variables are "loosely typed," which means that they are not limited
to a particular type of object. A single variable can even contain a collection
(an "array") of different types of objects at the same time.

The data type of a variable is determined by the .NET types of the values of
the variable.

For example:

```powershell
PS> $a = 12                         # System.Int32
PS> $a = "Word"                     # System.String
PS> $a = 12, "Word"                 # array of System.Int32, System.String
PS> $a = dir C:\Windows\System32    # FileInfo and DirectoryInfo types
```

You can use a type attribute and cast notation to ensure that a variable can
contain only objects of the specified type or objects that can be converted to
that type. If you try to assign a value of another type, PowerShell tries to
convert the value to its type. If it cannot, the assignment statement fails.

To use cast notation, enter a type name, enclosed in brackets, before the
variable name (on the left side of the assignment statement). The following
example creates an `$number` variable that can contain only integers, a
`$words` variable that can contain only strings, and a `$dates` variable that
can contain only DateTime objects.

```powershell
PS> [int]$number = 8
PS> $number = "12345" (The string is converted to an integer.)
PS> $number = "Hello"
Cannot convert value "Hello" to type "System.Int32". Error: "Input string
 was not in a correct format."
At line:1 char:3
+ $a <<<<  = "Hello"
    + CategoryInfo          : MetadataError: (:) [], ArgumentTransformati
onMetadataException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : RuntimeException

PS> [string]$words = "Hello"
PS> $words = 2   (The integer is converted to a string.)
PS> $words + 10  (The strings are concatenated.)
210

PS> #The string is converted to a DateTime object.
PS> [datetime] $dates = "09/12/91"
PS> $dates
Thursday, September 12, 1991 12:00:00 AM

PS> $dates = 10  #The integer is converted to a DateTime object.
PS> $dates
Monday, January 01, 0001 12:00:00 AM
```

### USING VARIABLES IN COMMANDS AND EXPRESSIONS

To use a variable in a command or expression, type the variable name, preceded
by the dollar sign (`$`).

If the variable name (and dollar sign) are not enclosed in quotation marks, or
if they are enclosed in double quotation marks ("), the value of the variable
is used in the command or expression.

If the variable name (and dollar sign) are enclosed in single quotation marks,
('), the variable name is used in the expression.

For example, the first command gets the value of the `$profile` variable, which
is the path to the PowerShell user profile file in the PowerShell console. The
second command opens the file in Notepad, and the third and fourth commands use
the name of the variable in an expression.

```powershell
PS> $profile
C:\Documents and Settings\User01\My Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microso
ft.PowerShell_profile.ps1

PS> notepad $profile
- or -
PS> notepad "$profile"
C:\Documents and Settings\User01\My Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microso
ft.PowerShell_profile.ps1

PS> '$profile'
$profile

PS> 'Use the $profile variable.'
Use the $profile variable.
```

For more information about using quotation marks in PowerShell, see [about_Quoting_Rules](about_Quoting_Rules.md).

### VARIABLE NAMES THAT INCLUDE SPECIAL CHARACTERS

Variable names begin with a dollar sign. They can include alphanumeric
characters and special characters. The length of the variable name is limited
only by available memory.

Whenever possible, variable names should include only alphanumeric characters
and the underscore character (_). Variable names that include spaces and other
special characters, are difficult to use and should be avoided.

To create or display a variable name that includes spaces or special
characters, enclose the variable name in braces. This directs PowerShell to
interpret the characters in the variable name literally.

For example, the following command creates and then displays a variable named
"save-items".

```powershell
PS> ${save-items} = "a", "b", "c"
PS> ${save-items}
a
b
c
```

The following command gets the child items in the directory that is represented
by the "ProgramFiles(x86)" environment variable.

```powershell
PS> Get-ChildItem ${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}
```

To reference a variable name that includes braces, enclose the variable name in
braces, and use the backtick (escape) character to escape the braces. For
example, to create a variable named "this{value}is" with a value of 1, type:

```powershell
PS> ${this`{value`}is} = 1
PS> ${this`{value`}is}
1
```

### VARIABLES AND SCOPE

By default, variables are available only in the scope in which they are
created.

For example, a variable that you create in a function is available only within
the function. A variable that you create in a script is available only within
the script (unless you dot-source the script, which adds it to the current
scope).

You can use a scope modifier to change the default scope of the variable. The
following expression creates a variable named "Computers". The variable has a
global scope, even when it is created in a script or function.

```powershell
$global:Computers = "Server01"
```

For more information, see [about_Scopes](about_Scopes.md).

### SAVING VARIABLES

Variables that you create are available only in the session in which you create
them. They are lost when you close your session.

To create the in every PowerShell session that you start, add the variable to
your PowerShell profile.

For example, to change the value of the `$VerbosePreference` variable in every
PowerShell session, add the following command to your PowerShell profile.

```powershell
$VerbosePreference = "Continue"
```

You can add this command to your profile by opening the profile file in a text
editor, such as Notepad. For more information about PowerShell profiles, see [about_Profiles](about_Profiles.md).

### THE VARIABLE: DRIVE

PowerShell Variable provider creates a Variable: drive that looks and acts like
a file system drive, but it contains the variables in your session and their
values.

To change to the Variable: drive, type:

```powershell
Set-Location Variable:
```

To list the items (variables) in the Variable: drive, use the `Get-Item` or
`Get-ChildItem` cmdlets. For example:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem Variable:
```

To get the value of a particular variable, use file system notation to specify
the name of the drive and the name of the variable. For example, to get the
`$PSCulture` automatic variable, use the following command.

```powershell
Get-Item Variable:\PSCulture

Name                           Value
----                           -----
PSCulture                      en-US
```

For more information about the Variable: drive and the PowerShell Variable
provider, type "get-help variable".

### THE VARIABLE CMDLETS

PowerShell includes a set of cmdlets that are designed to manage variables.

| Cmdlet Name     | Description                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Clear-Variable  | Deletes the value of a variable.           |
| Get-Variable    | Gets the variables in the current console. |
| New-Variable    | Creates a new variable.                    |
| Remove-Variable | Deletes a variable and its value.          |
| Set-Variable    | Changes the value of a variable.           |

To get help for these cmdlets, type: `Get-Help <cmdlet-name>`.
