## DESCRIPTION
The `Get-Help` cmdlet displays information about PowerShell concepts and commands, including cmdlets, functions, CIM commands, workflows, providers, aliases and scripts.

To get help for a PowerShell command, type "Get-Help" followed by the command name, such as: `Get-Help Get-Process`.

Conceptual help topics in PowerShell begin with "about_", such as "about_Comparison_Operators".
To see all "about_" topics, type `Get-Help about_*`.
To see a particular topic, type `Get-Help about_<topic-name>`, such as `Get-Help about_Comparison_Operators`.

To get help for a PowerShell provider, type `Get-Help` followed by the provider name.
For example, to get help for the Certificate provider, type `Get-Help Certificate`.

In addition to "Get-Help", you can also type `help` or `man`, which displays one screen of text at a time, or `<cmdlet-name> -?`, which is identical to `Get-Help` but works only for commands.

`Get-Help` gets the help content that it displays from help files on your computer.
Without the help files, `Get-Help` displays only basic information about commands.
Some PowerShell modules come with help files.
However, beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, the modules that come with Windows do not include help files.
To download or update the help files for a module in Windows PowerShell 3.0, use the `Update-Help` cmdlet.

You can also view the help topics for PowerShell online in the Microsoft Docs.
To get the online version of a help topic, use the **Online** parameter, such as: `Get-Help Get-Process -Online`.
To read all of the help topics, see [PowerShell Documentation](../../docs-conceptual/PowerShell-Scripting.md) in the Microsoft Docs.

If you type "Get-Help" followed by the exact name of a help topic, or by a word unique to a help topic, `Get-Help` displays the topic contents.
If you enter a word or word pattern that appears in several help topic titles, `Get-Help` displays a list of the matching titles.
If you enter a word that does not appear in any help topic titles, `Get-Help` displays a list of topics that include that word in their contents.

`Get-Help` can get help topics for all supported languages and locales.
`Get-Help` first looks for help files in the locale set for Windows, then in the parent locale (such as "pt" for "pt-BR"), and then in a fallback locale.
Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, if `Get-Help` does not find help in the fallback locale, it looks for help topics in English ("en-US") before returning an error message or displaying auto-generated help.

For information about the symbols that `Get-Help` displays in the command syntax diagram, see [about_Command_Syntax](About/about_Command_Syntax.md).
For information about parameter attributes, such as **Required** and **Position**, see [about_Parameters](About/about_Parameters.md).

**TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE**: In Windows PowerShell 3.0, **Get-Help** cannot find About topics in modules unless the module is imported into the current session.
This is a known issue.
To get About topics in a module, import the module, either by using the Import-Module cmdlet or by using a cmdlet in the module.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Get-Help Format-Table
Get-Help -Name Format-Table
Format-Table -?
```

These commands display basic information about the `Format-Table` cmdlet.

`Get-Help <name>` is the simplest and default syntax of `Get-Help` cmdlet.
You can omit the parameter name (**Name**).

`<command-name> -?` works only for commands.

### Example 2
```powershell
help Format-Table
man Format-Table
Get-Help Format-Table | Out-Host -Paging
```

These commands display basic information about the `Format-Table` cmdlet one page at a time.

The `help` is a function that runs `Get-Help` cmdlet internally and displays the result one page at a time.

The `man` is an alias for the `help` function.

The `Out-Host -Paging` receives the outputs of `Get-Help Format-Table` from pipeline and displays them one page at a time. For more information, see [Out-Host](./Out-Host.md).

### Example 3
```powershell
Get-Help Format-Table -Detailed
Get-Help Format-Table -Full
```

These commands display more information about the `Format-Table` cmdlet than usual.

The **Detailed** parameter displays the detailed view of the help topic, which includes parameter descriptions and examples.

The **Full** parameter displays the full view of the help topic, which includes parameter descriptions, examples, input and output object types, and additional notes.

The **Detailed** and **Full** parameters are effective only for the commands whose help files are installed on the computer.
They are not effective for the conceptual ("about_") help topics.

### Example 4
```powershell
Get-Help Format-Table -Examples
Get-Help Format-Table -Parameter GroupBy
Get-Help Format-Table -Parameter *
```

These commands display selected parts of the `Format-Table` cmdlet help.

The **Examples** parameter displays only the NAME, SYNOPSIS, and all Examples.
You can not specify an Example number because the **Examples** parameter is a switch parameter.

The **Parameter** parameter displays only the descriptions of the specified parameters.
If you specify only the wildcard character (`*`), it displays the descriptions of all parameters.

These parameters are not effective for the conceptual ("about_") help topics.

### Example 5
```powershell
Get-Help Format-Table -Online
```

This command displays the online version of the help topic for the `Format-Table` cmdlet in your default web browser.

### Example 6
```powershell
Get-Help
```

The `Get-Help` cmdlet without parameters displays information about the PowerShell help system.

### Example 7
```powershell
Get-Help *
```

This command displays a list of all help topics available on your system.

### Example 8

```
PS> Get-Help about_*
```

This command displays a list of the conceptual topics included in Windows PowerShell help.
All of these topics begin with the characters "about_".
To display a particular help file, type "get-help \<topic-name\>, for example, "Get-Help about_Signing".

This command displays the conceptual topics only when the help files for those topics are installed on the computer.
For information about downloading and installing help files in Windows PowerShell 3.0, see Update-Help.

### Example 9

```
PS> Get-Help Add-Member -Full | Out-String -Stream | Select-String -Pattern Clixml
```

This example shows how to search for a word in particular cmdlet help topic.
This command searches for the word "Clixml" in the full version of the help topic for the Add-Member cmdlet.

Because the **Get-Help** cmdlet generates a **MamlCommandHelpInfo** object, not a string, you need to use a cmdlet that transforms the help topic content into a string, such as Out-String or Out-File.

### Example 10

```
PS> Get-Help remoting
```

This command displays a list of topics that include the word "remoting."

When you enter a word that does not appear in any topic title, **Get-Help** displays a list of topics that include that word.

### Example 11

```
The first command uses the **Path** parameter of **Get-Help** to specify the provider path. This command can be entered at any path location.
PS> Get-Help Get-Item -Path SQLSERVER:\DataCollection

NAME

    Get-Item


SYNOPSIS

    Gets a collection of Server objects for the local computer and any computers

    to which you have made a SQL Server PowerShell connection.

    ...

The second command uses the Set-Location cmdlet (alias = "cd") to navigate to the provider path. From that location, even without the **Path** parameter, the **Get-Help** command gets the provider-specific help for the **Get-Item** cmdlet.
PS> cd SQLSERVER:\DataCollection
SQLSERVER:\DataCollection> Get-Help Get-Item

NAME

    Get-Item


SYNOPSIS

    Gets a collection of Server objects for the local computer and any computers

    to which you have made a SQL Server PowerShell connection.

    ...


The third command shows that a **Get-Help** command in a file system path, and without the **Path** parameter, gets the standard help for the **Get-Item** cmdlet.
PS> Get-Item

NAME

    Get-Item


SYNOPSIS

    Gets the item at the specified location.
    ...
```

This example shows how to get help that explains how to use the Get-Item cmdlet in the **DataCollection** node of the Windows PowerShell SQL Server provider.
The example shows two ways of getting the provider-specific help for **Get-Item**.

You can also get provider-specific help for cmdlets online in the section that describes the provider.
For example, for provider-specific online help for the New-Item cmdlet in each WSMan provider path, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=158676http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=158676.

### Example 12

```
PS> Get-Help C:\PS-Test\MyScript.ps1
```

This command gets help for the MyScript.ps1 script.
For information about writing help for your functions and scripts, see [about_Comment_Based_Help](About/about_Comment_Based_Help.md).

### System.String

If you get a conceptual help topic, **Get-Help** returns it as a string.

### MamlCommandHelpInfo

If you get a command that has a help file, **Get-Help** returns a **MamlCommandHelpInfo** object.

## NOTES
- Windows PowerShell 3.0 does not come with help files. To download and install the help files that **Get-Help** reads, use the Update-Help cmdlet. You can use the **Update-Help** cmdlet to download and install help files for the core commands that come with Windows PowerShell  and for any modules that you install. You can also use it to update the help files so that the help on your computer is never outdated.

  You can also read the help topics about the commands that come with Windows PowerShell online beginning at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=107116.

- **Get-Help** displays help in the locale set for Windows or in the fallback language for that locale. If you do not have help files for the primary or fallback locale, **Get-Help** behaves as though there are no help files on the computer. To get help for a different locale, use Region and Language in Control Panel to change the settings for Windows.
- The full view of help (-Full) includes a table of information about the parameters. The table includes the following fields:

  - Required:  Indicates whether the parameter is required (true) or optional (false).

  - Position:  Indicates whether the parameter is named or positional (numbered).
Positional parameters must appear in a specified place in the command.

  - "Named" indicates that the parameter name is required, but that the parameter can appear anywhere in the command.

  - \<Number\> indicates that the parameter name is optional, but when the name is omitted, the parameter must be in the place specified by the number.
For example, "2" indicates that when the parameter name is omitted, the parameter must be the second (2) or only unnamed parameter in the command.
When the parameter name is used, the parameter can appear anywhere in the command.

  - Default value: The parameter value that Windows PowerShell uses if you do not include the parameter in the command.

  - Accepts pipeline input: Indicates whether you can (true) or cannot (false) send objects to the parameter through a pipeline.
"By Property Name" means that the pipelined object must have a property with the same name as the parameter name.

  - Accepts wildcard characters: Indicates whether the value of a parameter can include wildcard characters, such as * and ?.
