# about_PSReadLine_Functions

## Short Description

PSReadLine provides an improved command-line editing experience in the
PowerShell console.

## Long Description

PowerShell 7.3 ships with PSReadLine 2.2.6. The current version is PSReadLine
2.3.4. The current version of PSReadLine can be installed and used on Windows
PowerShell 5.1 and newer. For some features, you need to be running PowerShell
7.2 or higher.

This article documents the functions provided by PSReadLine 2.3.4. These
functions can be bound to keystrokes for easy access and invocation.

## Using the Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine class

The following functions are available in the class
**Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine**.

## Basic editing functions

### Abort

Abort current action, for example: incremental history search.

- Emacs mode: `Ctrl+g`
- Vi insert mode: `Ctrl+g`
- Vi command mode: `<Ctrl+g>`

### AcceptAndGetNext

Attempt to execute the current input. If it can be executed (like AcceptLine),
then recall the next item from history the next time ReadLine is called.

- Emacs mode: `Ctrl+o`

### AcceptLine

Attempt to execute the current input. If the current input is incomplete (for
example there's a missing closing parenthesis, bracket, or quote) then the
continuation prompt is displayed on the next line and PSReadLine waits for
keys to edit the current input.

- Windows mode: `Enter`
- Emacs mode: `Enter`
- Vi insert mode: `Enter`

### AddLine

The continuation prompt is displayed on the next line and PSReadLine waits for
keys to edit the current input. This is useful to enter multi-line input as a
single command even when a single line is complete input by itself.

- Windows mode: `Shift+Enter`
- Emacs mode: `Shift+Enter`
- Vi insert mode: `Shift+Enter`
- Vi command mode: `<Shift+Enter>`

### BackwardDeleteInput

Like BackwardKillInput - deletes text from the point to the start of the input,
but doesn't put the deleted text in the kill-ring.

- Windows mode: `Ctrl+Home`
- Vi insert mode: `Ctrl+u`, `Ctrl+Home`
- Vi command mode: `<Ctrl+u>`, `<Ctrl+Home>`

### BackwardDeleteLine

Like BackwardKillLine - deletes text from the point to the start of the line,
but doesn't put the deleted text in the kill-ring.

- Vi command mode: `<d,0>`

### BackwardDeleteWord

Deletes the previous word.

- Vi command mode: `<Ctrl+w>`, `<d,b>`

### BackwardKillInput

Clear the text from the start of the input to the cursor. The cleared text is
placed in the kill-ring.

- Emacs mode: `Ctrl+u`, `Ctrl+x,Backspace`

### BackwardKillLine

Clear the text from the start of the current logical line to the cursor. The
cleared text is placed in the kill-ring.

- Function is unbound.

### BackwardKillWord

Clear the input from the start of the current word to the cursor. If the cursor
is between words, the input is cleared from the start of the previous word to
the cursor. The cleared text is placed in the kill-ring.

- Windows mode: `Ctrl+Backspace`, `Ctrl+w`
- Emacs mode: `Alt+Backspace`, `Escape,Backspace`
- Vi insert mode: `Ctrl+Backspace`
- Vi command mode: `<Ctrl+Backspace>`

### BackwardReplaceChar

Replaces the character in front of the cursor.

- Vi command mode: `<c,h>`

### CancelLine

Cancel the current input, leaving the input on the screen, but returns back to
the host so the prompt is evaluated again.

- Vi insert mode: `Ctrl+c`
- Vi command mode: `<Ctrl+c>`

### CapitalizeWord

> Added in PSReadLine 2.3.0

Convert the first character of the next word to upper case and the remaining
characters to lower case.

- Emacs mode: `Alt+c`, `Escape,c`

### Copy

Copy selected region to the system clipboard. If no region is selected, copy
the whole line.

- Windows mode: `Ctrl+C`

### CopyOrCancelLine

If text is selected, copy to the clipboard, otherwise cancel the line.

- Windows mode: `Ctrl+c`
- Emacs mode: `Ctrl+c`

### Cut

Delete selected region placing deleted text in the system clipboard.

- Windows mode: `Ctrl+x`

### DeleteCharOrExit

Delete the character under the cursor, or if the line is empty, exit the
process.

- Emacs mode: `Ctrl+d`

### DeleteEndOfBuffer

Deletes to the end of the multiline buffer.

- Vi command mode: `<d,G>`

### DeleteEndOfWord

Delete to the end of the word.

multiline buffer.

- Vi command mode: `<d,^>`

### DeleteNextLines

Deletes the current and next n logical lines in a multiline buffer.

- Vi command mode: `<d,j>`

### DeletePreviousLines

Deletes the previous requested logical lines and the current logical line in a
multiline buffer.

- Vi command mode: `<d,k>`

### DeleteRelativeLines

Deletes from the beginning of the buffer to the current logical line in a
multiline buffer.

As most Vi commands, the `<d,g,g>` command can be prepended with a numeric
argument that specifies an absolute line number, which, together with the
current line number, make up a range of lines to be deleted. If not specified,
the numeric argument defaults to 1, which refers to the first logical line in a
multiline buffer.

The actual number of lines to be deleted from the multiline is computed as the
difference between the current logical line number and the specified numeric
argument, which can thus be negative. Hence the _relative_ part of method name.

- Vi command mode: `<d,g,g>`

### DeleteToEnd

Delete to the end of the line.

- Vi command mode: `<D>`, `<d,$>`

### DeleteWord

Delete the next word.

- Vi command mode: `<d,w>`

### Paste

Paste text from the system clipboard.

- Windows mode: `Ctrl+v`, `Shift+Insert`
- Vi insert mode: `Ctrl+v`
- Vi command mode: `<Ctrl+v>`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using the **Paste** function, the entire contents of the clipboard
> buffer is pasted into the input buffer of PSReadLine. The input buffer is
> then passed to the PowerShell parser. Input pasted using the console
> application's **right-click** paste method is copied to the input buffer one
> character at a time. The input buffer is passed to the parser when a newline
> character is copied. Therefore, the input is parsed one line at a time. The
> difference between paste methods results in different execution behavior.

### PasteAfter

## Custom Key Binding Support APIs

The following functions are public in Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine,
but can't be directly bound to a key. Most are useful in custom key bindings.

```csharp
void AddToHistory(string command)
```

Add a command line to history without executing it.

```csharp
void ClearKillRing()
```

Clear the kill-ring. This is mostly used for testing.

```csharp
void Delete(int start, int length)
```

Delete length characters from start. This operation supports undo/redo.

```csharp
void Ding()
```

Perform the Ding action based on the user's preference.

```csharp
void GetBufferState([ref] string input, [ref] int cursor)
void GetBufferState([ref] Ast ast, [ref] Token[] tokens,
  [ref] ParseError[] parseErrors, [ref] int cursor)
```

These two functions retrieve useful information about the current state of the
input buffer. The first is more commonly used for simple cases. The second is
used if your binding is doing something more advanced with the Ast.

```csharp
IEnumerable[Microsoft.PowerShell.KeyHandler]
  GetKeyHandlers(bool includeBound, bool includeUnbound)

IEnumerable[Microsoft.PowerShell.KeyHandler]
  GetKeyHandlers(string[] Chord)
```

These two functions are used by `Get-PSReadLineKeyHandler`. The first is used
to get all key bindings. The second is used to get specific key bindings.

```csharp
Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLineOptions GetOptions()
```

This function is used by Get-PSReadLineOption and probably isn't too useful in
a custom key binding.

```csharp
void GetSelectionState([ref] int start, [ref] int length)
```

If there's no selection on the command line, the function returns -1 in both
start and length. If there's a selection on the command line, the start and
length of the selection are returned.

```csharp
void Insert(char c)
void Insert(string s)
```

Insert a character or string at the cursor. This operation supports undo/redo.

```csharp
string ReadLine(runspace remoteRunspace,
  System.Management.Automation.EngineIntrinsics engineIntrinsics)
```

This is the main entry point to PSReadLine. It doesn't support recursion, so
isn't useful in a custom key binding.

```csharp
void RemoveKeyHandler(string[] key)
```

This function is used by Remove-PSReadLineKeyHandler and probably isn't too
useful in a custom key binding.

```csharp
void Replace(int start, int length, string replacement)
```

Replace some input. This operation supports undo/redo. This is preferred over
Delete followed by Insert because it's treated as a single action for undo.

```csharp
void SetCursorPosition(int cursor)
```

Move the cursor to the given offset. Cursor movement isn't tracked for undo.

```csharp
void SetOptions(Microsoft.PowerShell.SetPSReadLineOption options)
```

This function is a helper method used by the cmdlet `Set-PSReadLineOption`, but
might be useful to a custom key binding that wants to temporarily change a
setting.

```csharp
bool TryGetArgAsInt(System.Object arg, [ref] int numericArg,
  int defaultNumericArg)
```

This helper method is used for custom bindings that honor DigitArgument. A
typical call looks like

```powershell
[int]$numericArg = 0
[Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]::TryGetArgAsInt($arg,
  [ref]$numericArg, 1)
```

## Notes

Behavior of the OnIdle event

- When PSReadLine is in use, the **OnIdle** event is fired when `ReadKey()`
  times out (no typing in 300ms). The event could be signaled while the user is
  in the middle of editing a command line, for example, the user is reading
  help to decide which parameter to use.

  Beginning in PSReadLine 2.2.0-beta4, **OnIdle** behavior changed to signal
  the event only if there's a `ReadKey()` timeout and the current editing
  buffer is empty.
