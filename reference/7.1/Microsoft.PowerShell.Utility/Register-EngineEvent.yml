### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Subscribes to events that are generated by the PowerShell engine and by the `New-Event` cmdlet.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
notes: |-
  No event sources available on the Linux or macOS platforms.

  Events, event subscriptions, and the event queue exist only in the current session. If you close the
  current session, the event queue is discarded and the event subscription is canceled.

    You cannot pipe input to `Register-EngineEvent`.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="None or System.Management.Automation.PSEventJob" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    If you use the **Action** parameter, `Register-EngineEvent` returns a
    **System.Management.Automation.PSEventJob** object. Otherwise, it does not generate any output.

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Register a PowerShell engine event on remote computers'
  code: |-
    $S = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Server01, Server02"
    Invoke-Command -Session $S {
    Register-EngineEvent -SourceIdentifier ([System.Management.Automation.PsEngineEvent]::Exiting) -Forward
    }
  description: |-
    `New-PSSession` creates a user-managed session (PSSession) on each of the remote computers.The
    `Invoke-Command` cmdlet runs the `Register-EngineEvent` command in the remote sessions.
    `Register-EngineEvent` uses the **SourceIdentifier** parameter to identify the event. The
    **Forward** parameter tell the engine to forward the events from the remote session to the local
    session.
  summary: |+
    This example registers for a PowerShell engine event on two remote computers.

- title: 'Example 2: Take a specified action when the Exiting event occurs'
  code: |-
    Register-EngineEvent -SourceIdentifier PowerShell.Exiting -SupportEvent -Action {
        Get-History | Export-Clixml $Home\history.clixml
    }
  description: |-
    The **SupportEvent** parameter is added to hide the event subscription. When PowerShell exits, in
    this case, the command history from the exiting session is exported an XML file in the user's
    `$Home` directory.
  summary: |+
    This example shows how to run `Register-EngineEvent` to take a specific action when the
    **PowerShell.Exiting** event occurs.

- title: 'Example 3: Create and subscribe to a user-defined event'
  code: |-
    Register-EngineEvent -SourceIdentifier MyEventSource -Action {
        "Event: {0}" -f $event.messagedata | Out-File c:\temp\MyEvents.txt -Append
    }

    Start-Job -Name TestJob -ScriptBlock {
        While ($True) {
            Register-EngineEvent -SourceIdentifier MyEventSource -Forward

  description: |-
    `Register-EngineEvent` created Job Id 18. `Start-Job` created Job Id 19. In Example #4, we remove
    the event subscription and the jobs, then inspect the log file.
  summary: |+
    This example creates a subscription for events from the source **MyEventSource**. This is an
    arbitrary source that we are going to use to monitor the progress of a job. `Register-EngineEvent`
    is used to create the subscription. The script block for the **Action** parameter logs the event
    data to a text file.

  description: |-
    The `Unregister-Event` cmdlet stops the job associated with the event subscription (Job Id 18). Job
    Id 19 is still running and creating new events. We use the **Job** cmdlets stop the job and remove
    the unneeded job objects. `Get-Content` displays the contents of the log file.
  summary: |+
    This is a continuation of Example 3. In this example we wait for 10 seconds to let several events
    occur. Then we unregister the event subscription.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Action
  description: |+
    Specifies commands to handle the events. The commands in the **Action** run when an event is raised,
    instead of sending the event to the event queue. Enclose the commands in braces ( { } ) to create a
    script block.

    The value of the **Action** parameter can include the `$Event`, `$EventSubscriber`, `$Sender`,
    `$EventArgs`, and `$Args` automatic variables, which provide information about the event to the
    **Action** script block. For more information, see
    [about_Automatic_Variables](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Automatic_Variables.md).

    When you specify an action, `Register-EngineEvent` returns an event job object that represents that
    action. You can use the Job cmdlets to manage the event job.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "101"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Forward
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet sends events for this subscription to the session on the local computer.
    Use this parameter when you are registering for events on a remote computer or in a remote session.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MaxTriggerCount
  description: |+
    Specifies the maximum number of times that the action will be executed for the event subscription.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.PSObject" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MessageData
  description: |+
    Specifies additional data associated with the event. The value of this parameter appears in the
    **MessageData** property of the event object.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SourceIdentifier
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the source identifier of the event to which you are subscribing. The source identifier
    must be unique in the current session. This parameter is required.

    The value of this parameter appears in the value of the **SourceIdentifier** property of the
    subscriber object and of all event objects associated with this subscription.

    The value is specific to the source of the event. This can be an arbitrary value you created to use
    with the `New-Event` cmdlet. The PowerShell engine supports the **EngineEvent** values
    **PowerShell.Exiting** and **PowerShell.OnIdle**.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "100"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SupportEvent
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet hides the event subscription. Add this parameter when the current
    subscription is part of a more complex event registration mechanism and it should not be discovered
    independently.

    To view or cancel a subscription that was created with the **SupportEvent** parameter, add the
    **Force** parameter to the `Get-EventSubscriber` or `Unregister-Event` cmdlets.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.Register-EngineEvent
name: Register-EngineEvent
description: |-
  The `Register-EngineEvent` cmdlet subscribes to events that are generated by the PowerShell engine
  and the `New-Event` cmdlet. Use the **SourceIdentifier** parameter to specify the event.

  You can use this cmdlet to subscribe to the **Exiting** engine event and events generated by the
  `New-Event` cmdlet. These events are automatically added to your event queue in your session without
  subscribing. However, subscribing lets you forward the events, specify an action to respond to the
  events, and cancel the subscription.

  When the subscribed event is raised, it is added to the event queue in your session. To get events
  in the event queue, use the `Get-Event` cmdlet.

  When you subscribe to a event, an event subscriber is added to your session. To get the event
  subscribers in the session, use the `Get-EventSubscriber` cmdlet. To cancel the subscription, use
  the `Unregister-Event` cmdlet, which deletes the event subscriber from the session.
