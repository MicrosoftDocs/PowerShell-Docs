    Indicates that the cmdlet displays asterisks (`*`) in place of the characters that the user types as
    input. When you use this parameter, the output of the `Read-Host` cmdlet is a **String** object.
    This allows you to safely prompt for a password that is returned as plaintext instead of
    **SecureString**.

description: |-
  The `Read-Host` cmdlet reads a line of input from the console. You can use it to prompt a user for
  input. Because you can save the input as a secure string, you can use this cmdlet to prompt users
  for secure data, such as passwords, as well as shared data.
