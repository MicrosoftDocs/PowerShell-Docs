### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Sends an HTTP or HTTPS request to a RESTful web service.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
notes: |-
  Some features may not be available on all platforms.

  Because of changes in .NET Core 3.1, PowerShell 7.0 and higher use the
  [HttpClient.DefaultProxy](/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient.defaultproxy?view=netcore-3.1)
  Property to determine the proxy configuration.

  The value of this property is different rules depending on your platform:

  - **For Windows**: Reads proxy configuration from environment variables or, if those are not
    defined, from the user's proxy settings.
  - **For macOS**: Reads proxy configuration from environment variables or, if those are not defined,
    from the system's proxy settings.
  - **For Linux**: Reads proxy configuration from environment variables or, in case those are not
    defined, this property initializes a non-configured instance that bypasses all addresses.

  The environment variables used for `DefaultProxy` initialization on Windows and Unix-based platforms
  are:

  - ` HTTP_PROXY`: the hostname or IP address of the proxy server used on HTTP requests.
  - `HTTPS_PROXY`: the hostname or IP address of the proxy server used on HTTPS requests.
  - `ALL_PROXY`: the hostname or IP address of the proxy server used on HTTP and HTTPS requests in
    case `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` are not defined.
  - `NO_PROXY`: a comma-separated list of hostnames that should be excluded from proxying.

  summary: |+
    This example uses the `Invoke-RestMethod` cmdlet to get information from the PowerShell Blog RSS
    feed. The command uses the `Format-Table` cmdlet to display the values of the **Title** and
    **pubDate** properties of each blog in a table.

- title: 'Example 2: Run a POST request'
  code: |-
    $Cred = Get-Credential
    $Url = "https://server.contoso.com:8089/services/search/jobs/export"
    $Body = @{
        search = "search index=_internal | reverse | table index,host,source,sourcetype,_raw"
        output_mode = "csv"
        earliest_time = "-2d@d"
        latest_time = "-1d@d"
    }
    Invoke-RestMethod -Method 'Post' -Uri $url -Credential $Cred -Body $body -OutFile output.csv
  description: |-
    The credentials are prompted for and then stored in `$Cred` and the URL that will be access is
    defined in `$Url`.

    The `$Body` variable describes the search criteria, specifies CSV as the output mode, and specifies
    a time period for returned data that starts two days ago and ends one day ago. The body variable
    specifies values for parameters that apply to the particular REST API with which `Invoke-RestMethod`
    is communicating.

    The `Invoke-RestMethod` command is run with all variables in place, specifying a path and file name
    for the resulting CSV output file.
  summary: |+
    In this example, a user runs `Invoke-RestMethod` to do a POST request on an intranet website in the
    user's organization.

- title: 'Example 3: Follow relation links'
  code: |-
    $url = 'https://api.github.com/repos/powershell/powershell/issues'
    Invoke-RestMethod $url -FollowRelLink -MaximumFollowRelLink 2
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    Some REST APIs support pagination via Relation Links per
    [RFC5988](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#page-6). Instead of parsing the header to get the URL
    for the next page, you can have the cmdlet do this for you. This example returns the first two pages
    of issues from the PowerShell GitHub repository.

- title: 'Example 4: Simplified Multipart/Form-Data Submission'
  code: |-
    $Uri = 'https://api.contoso.com/v2/profile'
    $Form = @{
        firstName  = 'John'
        lastName   = 'Doe'
        email      = 'john.doe@contoso.com'
        avatar     = Get-Item -Path 'c:\Pictures\jdoe.png'
        birthday   = '1980-10-15'
        hobbies    = 'Hiking','Fishing','Jogging'
    }
    $Result = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $Uri -Method Post -Form $Form
  description: |-
    The profile form requires these fields: `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `avatar`, `birthday`, and
    `hobbies`. The API is expecting an image for the user profile pic to be supplied in the `avatar`
    field. The API will also accept multiple `hobbies` entries to be submitted in the same form.

    When creating the `$Form` HashTable, the key names are used as form field names. By default, the
    values of the HashTable will be converted to strings. If a `System.IO.FileInfo` value is present,
    the file contents will be submitted. If a collection such as arrays or lists are present, the form
    field will be submitted multiple times.

    By using `Get-Item` on the `avatar` key, the `FileInfo` object will be set as the value. The result
    is that the image data for `jdoe.png` will be submitted.

    By supplying a list to the `hobbies` key, the `hobbies` field will be present in the submissions
    once for each list item.
  summary: |+
    Some APIs require `multipart/form-data` submissions to upload files and mixed content. This example
    demonstrates how to update a user's profile.

- title: 'Example 5: Pass multiple headers'
  code: |-
    $headers = @{
        'userId' = 'UserIDValue'
        'token' = 'TokenValue'
    }
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    APIs often require passed headers for authentication or validation. This example demonstrates, how
    to pass multiple headers from a `hash-table` to a REST API.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowUnencryptedAuthentication
  description: |+
    Allows sending of credentials and secrets over unencrypted connections. By default, supplying
    **Credential** or any **Authentication** option with a **Uri** that does not begin with `https://`
    will result in an error and the request will abort to prevent unintentionally communicating secrets
    in plain text over unencrypted connections. To override this behavior at your own risk, supply the
    **AllowUnencryptedAuthentication** parameter.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Using this parameter is not secure and is not recommended. It is provided only for compatibility
    > with legacy systems that cannot provide encrypted connections. Use at your own risk.

    This feature was added in PowerShell 6.0.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WebAuthenticationType" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Authentication
  description: |+
    Specifies the explicit authentication type to use for the request. The default is **None**.
    **Authentication** can't be used with **UseDefaultCredentials**.

    Available Authentication Options:

    - **None**: This is the default option when **Authentication** is not supplied. No explicit
      authentication will be used.
    - **Basic**: Requires **Credential**. The credentials will be used to send an RFC 7617 Basic
      Authentication `Authorization: Basic` header in the format of `base64(user:password)`.
    - **Bearer**: Requires **Token**. Will send and RFC 6750 `Authorization: Bearer` header with the
      supplied token. This is an alias for **OAuth**
    - **OAuth**: Requires **Token**. Will send an RFC 6750 `Authorization: Bearer` header with the
      supplied token. This is an alias for **Bearer**

    Supplying **Authentication** will override any `Authorization` headers supplied to **Headers** or
    included in **WebSession**.

    This feature was added in PowerShell 6.0.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: None, Basic, Bearer, OAuth
- type: <xref href="System.Object" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Body
  description: |+
    Specifies the body of the request. The body is the content of the request that follows the headers.
    You can also pipe a body value to `Invoke-RestMethod`.

    The **Body** parameter can be used to specify a list of query parameters or specify the content of
    the response.

    When the input is a GET request, and the body is an `IDictionary` (typically, a hash table), the
    body is added to the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) as query parameters. For other request types
    (such as POST), the body is set as the value of the request body in the standard name=value format.

    When the body is a form, or it's the output of another `Invoke-WebRequest` call, PowerShell sets the
    request content to the form fields.

    The **Body** parameter may also accept a **System.Net.Http.MultipartFormDataContent** object. This
    will facilitate `multipart/form-data` requests. When a **MultipartFormDataContent** object is
    supplied for **Body**, any content related headers supplied to the **ContentType**, **Headers**, or
    **WebSession** parameters will be overridden by the content headers of the
    `MultipartFormDataContent` object. This feature was added in PowerShell 6.0.0.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Certificate
  description: |+
    Specifies the client certificate that is used for a secure web request. Enter a variable that
    contains a certificate or a command or expression that gets the certificate.

    To find a certificate, use `Get-PfxCertificate` or use the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet in the Certificate
    (`Cert:`) drive. If the certificate isn't valid or doesn't have sufficient authority, the command
    fails.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificateThumbprint
  description: |+
    Specifies the digital public key certificate (X509) of a user account that has permission to send
    the request. Enter the certificate thumbprint of the certificate.

    Certificates are used in client certificate-based authentication. They can be mapped only to local
    user accounts; they do not work with domain accounts.

    To get a certificate thumbprint, use the `Get-Item` or `Get-ChildItem` command in the PowerShell
    `Cert:` drive.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This feature is currently only supported on Windows OS platforms.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ContentType
  description: |+
    Specifies the content type of the web request.

    If this parameter is omitted and the request method is POST, `Invoke-RestMethod` sets the content
    type to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. Otherwise, the content type isn't specified in the
    call.

    **ContentType** will be overridden when a `MultipartFormDataContent` object is supplied for
    **Body**.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies a user account that has permission to send the request. The default is the current user.

    Type a user name, such as **User01** or **Domain01\User01**, or enter a **PSCredential** object
    generated by the `Get-Credential` cmdlet.

    **Credential** can be used alone or in conjunction with certain **Authentication** parameter
    options. When used alone, it will only supply credentials to the remote server if the remote server
    sends an authentication challenge request. When used with **Authentication** options, the
    credentials will be explicitly sent.

    Credentials are stored in a [PSCredential](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential)
    object and the password is stored as a [SecureString](/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring).

    > [!NOTE]
    > For more information about **SecureString** data protection, see
    > [How secure is SecureString?](/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring#how-secure-is-securestring).

  defaultValue: Current user
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CustomMethod
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies custom method used for the web request. This can be used with the Request Method required
    by the endpoint is not an available option on the **Method**. **Method** and **CustomMethod** cannot
    be used together.

    Example:

    `Invoke-RestMethod -uri 'https://api.contoso.com/widget/' -CustomMethod 'TEST'`

    This makes a `TEST` HTTP request to the API.

    This feature was added in PowerShell 6.0.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: CM
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DisableKeepAlive
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet sets the **KeepAlive** value in the HTTP header to False. By default,
    **KeepAlive** is True. **KeepAlive** establishes a persistent connection to the server to facilitate
    subsequent requests.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: FollowRelLink
  description: |+
    Indicates the cmdlet should follow relation links.

    Some REST APIs support pagination via Relation Links per
    [RFC5988](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#page-6). Instead of parsing the header to get the URL
    for the next page, you can have the cmdlet do this for you. To set how many times to follow relation
    links, use the **MaximumFollowRelLink** parameter.

    When using this switch, the cmdlet returns a collection of pages of results. Each page of results
    may contain multiple result items.

    This feature was added in PowerShell 6.0.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: FL
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Collections.IDictionary" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Form
  description: |+
    Converts a dictionary to a `multipart/form-data` submission. **Form** may not be used with **Body**.
    If **ContentType** will be ignored.

    The keys of the dictionary will be used as the form field names. By default, form values will be
    converted to string values.

    If the value is a **System.IO.FileInfo** object, then the binary file contents will be submitted.
    The name of the file will be submitted as the `filename`. The MIME will be set as
    `application/octet-stream`. `Get-Item` can be used to simplify supplying the **System.IO.FileInfo**
    object.



    $Form = @{
        resume = Get-Item 'c:\Users\jdoe\Documents\John Doe.pdf'
    }

    If the value is a collection type, such as an Array or List, the for field will be submitted
    multiple times. The values of the list will be treated as strings by default. If the value is a
    **System.IO.FileInfo** object, then the binary file contents will be submitted. Nested collections
    aren't supported.



    $Form = @{
        tags     = 'Vacation', 'Italy', '2017'
        pictures = Get-ChildItem 'c:\Users\jdoe\Pictures\2017-Italy\'
    }

    In the above example, the `tags` field will be supplied three times in the form, once for each of
    `Vacation`, `Italy`, and `2017`. The `pictures` field will also be submitted once for each file in
    the `2017-Italy` folder. The binary contents of the files in that folder will be submitted as the
    values.

    This feature was added in PowerShell 6.1.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Collections.IDictionary" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Headers
  description: |+
    Specifies the headers of the web request. Enter a hash table or dictionary.

    To set UserAgent headers, use the **UserAgent** parameter. You cannot use this parameter to specify
    `User-Agent` or cookie headers.

    Content related headers, such as `Content-Type` will be overridden when a `MultipartFormDataContent`
    object is supplied for **Body**.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InFile
  description: |+
    Gets the content of the web request from a file.

    Enter a path and file name. If you omit the path, the default is the current location.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MaximumFollowRelLink
  description: |+
    Specifies how many times to follow relation links if **FollowRelLink** is used. A smaller value may
    be needed if the REST api throttles due to too many requests. The default value is
    `[Int32]::MaxValue`. A value of 0 (zero) prevents following relation links.

  defaultValue: Int32.MaxValue
  position: Named
  aliases: ML
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MaximumRedirection
  description: |+
    Specifies how many times PowerShell redirects a connection to an alternate Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) before the connection fails. The default value is 5. A value of 0 (zero) prevents
    all redirection.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MaximumRetryCount
  description: |+
    Specifies how many times PowerShell retries a connection when a failure code between 400 and 599,
    inclusive or 304 is received. Also see **RetryIntervalSec** parameter for specifying number of
    retries.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WebRequestMethod" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Method
  description: |+
    Specifies the method used for the web request. The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Default
    - Delete
    - Get
    - Head
    - Merge
    - Options
    - Patch
    - Post
    - Put

    Saves the response body in the specified output file. Enter a path and file name. If you omit the
    path, the default is the current location. The name is treated as a literal path. Names that contain
    brackets (`[]`) must be enclosed in single quotes (`'`).

    By default, `Invoke-RestMethod` returns the results to the pipeline. To send the results to a file
    and to the pipeline, use the **Passthru** parameter.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PassThru
  description: |+
    Returns the results, in addition to writing them to a file. This parameter is valid only when the
    **OutFile** parameter is also used in the command.

  defaultValue: No output

  name: PreserveAuthorizationOnRedirect
  description: |+
    Indicates the cmdlet should preserve the `Authorization` header, when present, across redirections.

    By default, the cmdlet strips the `Authorization` header before redirecting. Specifying this
    parameter disables this logic for cases where the header needs to be sent to the redirection
    location.

    This feature was added in PowerShell 6.0.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Uri" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Proxy
  description: |+
    Uses a proxy server for the request, rather than connecting directly to the internet resource. Enter
    the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of a network proxy server.

    This feature was added in PowerShell 6.0.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ProxyCredential
  description: |+
    Specifies a user account that has permission to use the proxy server that is specified by the
    **Proxy** parameter. The default is the current user.

    Type a user name, such as **User01** or **Domain01\User01**, **User@Domain.Com**, or enter a
    `PSCredential` object, such as one generated by the `Get-Credential` cmdlet.

    This parameter is valid only when the **Proxy** parameter is also used in the command. You can't use
    the **ProxyCredential** and **ProxyUseDefaultCredentials** parameters in the same command.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ProxyUseDefaultCredentials
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet uses the credentials of the current user to access the proxy server that
    is specified by the **Proxy** parameter.

    This parameter is valid only when the **Proxy** parameter is also used in the command. You can't use
    the **ProxyCredential** and **ProxyUseDefaultCredentials** parameters in the same command.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ResponseHeadersVariable
  description: |+
    Creates a Response Headers Dictionary and saves it in the value of the specified variable. The keys
    of the dictionary will contain the field names of the Response Header returned by the web server and
    the values will be the respective field values.

    This feature was added in PowerShell 6.0.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: RHV
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Resume
  description: |+
    Performs a best effort attempt to resume downloading a partial file. The **Resume** parameter
    requires the **OutFile** parameter.

    **Resume** only operates on the size of the local file and remote file and performs no other
    validation that the local file and the remote file are the same.

    If the local file size is smaller than the remote file size, then the cmdlet will attempt to resume
    downloading the file and append the remaining bytes to the end of the file.

    If the local file size is the same as the remote file size, then no action is taken and the cmdlet
    assumes the download already completed.

    If the local file size is larger than the remote file size, then the local file will be overwritten
    and the entire remote file will be completely re-downloaded. This behavior is the same as using
    **OutFile** without **Resume**.

    If the remote server does not support download resuming, then the local file will be overwritten and
    the entire remote file will be completely re-downloaded. This behavior is the same as using
    **OutFile** without **Resume**.

    If the local file doesn't exist, then the local file will be created and the entire remote file will
    be completely downloaded. This behavior is the same as using **OutFile** without **Resume**.

    This feature was added in PowerShell 6.1.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RetryIntervalSec
  description: |+
    Specifies the interval between retries for the connection when a failure code between 400 and 599,
    inclusive or 304 is received. Also see **MaximumRetryCount** parameter for specifying number of
    retries.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SessionVariable
  description: |+
    Specifies a variable for which this cmdlet creates a web request session and saves it in the value.
    Enter a variable name without the dollar sign (`$`) symbol.

    When you specify a session variable, `Invoke-RestMethod` creates a web request session object and
    assigns it to a variable with the specified name in your PowerShell session. You can use the
    variable in your session as soon as the command completes.

    Unlike a remote session, the web request session isn't a persistent connection. It's an object that
    contains information about the connection and the request, including cookies, credentials, the
    maximum redirection value, and the user agent string. You can use it to share state and data among
    web requests.

    To use the web request session in subsequent web requests, specify the session variable in the value
    of the **WebSession** parameter. PowerShell uses the data in the web request session object when
    establishing the new connection. To override a value in the web request session, use a cmdlet
    parameter, such as **UserAgent** or **Credential**. Parameter values take precedence over values in
    the web request session.

    You can't use the **SessionVariable** and **WebSession** parameters in the same command.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: SV
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SkipCertificateCheck
  description: |+
    Skips certificate validation checks that include all validations such as expiration, revocation,
    trusted root authority, etc.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Using this parameter is not secure and is not recommended. This switch is only intended to be used
    > against known hosts using a self-signed certificate for testing purposes. Use at your own risk.

    This feature was added in PowerShell 6.0.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SkipHeaderValidation
  description: |+
    Indicates the cmdlet should add headers to the request without validation.

    This switch should be used for sites that require header values that do not conform to standards.
    Specifying this switch disables validation to allow the value to be passed unchecked. When
    specified, all headers are added without validation.

    This will disable validation for values passed to the **ContentType**, **Headers**, and **UserAgent**
    parameters.

    This feature was added in PowerShell 6.0.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SkipHttpErrorCheck
  description: |+
    This parameter causes the cmdlet to ignore HTTP error statuses and continue to process responses.
    The error responses are written to the pipeline just as if they were successful.

    This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 7.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WebSslProtocol" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SslProtocol
  description: |+
    Sets the SSL/TLS protocols that are permissible for the web request. By default all, SSL/TLS
    protocols supported by the system are allowed. **SslProtocol** allows for limiting to specific
    protocols for compliance purposes.

    **SslProtocol** uses the `WebSslProtocol` Flag Enum. It is possible to supply more than one protocol
    using flag notation or combining multiple `WebSslProtocol` options with `-bor`, however supplying
    multiple protocols is not supported on all platforms.

    > [!NOTE]
    > On non-Windows platforms it may not be possible to supply `Tls` or `Tls12` as an option. Support
    > for `Tls13` is not available on all operating systems and will need to be verified on a per
    > operating system basis.

    This feature was added in PowerShell 6.0.0 and support for `Tls13` was added in PowerShell 7.1.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Default, Tls, Tls11, Tls12, Tls13
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: StatusCodeVariable
  description: |+
    This parameter specifies a variable that's assigned a status code's integer value. The parameter can
    identify success messages or failure messages when used with the **SkipHttpErrorCheck** parameter.

    Input the parameter's variable name as a string such as `-StatusCodeVariable "scv"`.

    This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 7.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TimeoutSec
  description: |+
    Specifies how long the request can be pending before it times out. Enter a value in seconds. The
    default value, 0, specifies an indefinite time-out.

    A Domain Name System (DNS) query can take up to 15 seconds to return or time out. If your request
    contains a host name that requires resolution, and you set **TimeoutSec** to a value greater than
    zero, but less than 15 seconds, it can take 15 seconds or more before a WebException is thrown, and
    your request times out.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Security.SecureString" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Token
  description: |+
    The OAuth or Bearer token to include in the request. **Token** is required by certain
    **Authentication** options. It can't be used independently.

    **Token** takes a `SecureString` that contains the token. To supply the token, manually use the
    following:

    `Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Authentication OAuth -Token (Read-Host -AsSecureString)`

    This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 6.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TransferEncoding
  description: |+
    Specifies a value for the transfer-encoding HTTP response header. The acceptable values for this
    parameter are:

    - Chunked
    - Compress
    - Deflate
    - GZip
    - Identity

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: chunked, compress, deflate, gzip, identity
- type: <xref href="System.Uri" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Uri
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the internet resource to which the web request is
    sent. This parameter supports HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and FILE values.

    This parameter is required. The parameter name (**Uri**) is optional.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UseBasicParsing
  description: |+
    This parameter has been deprecated. Beginning with PowerShell 6.0.0, all Web requests use basic
    parsing only. This parameter is included for backwards compatibility only and any use of it will
    have no effect on the operation of the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UseDefaultCredentials
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet uses the credentials of the current user to send the web request. This
    can't be used with **Authentication** or **Credential** and may not be supported on all platforms.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: UserAgent
  description: |+
    Specifies a user agent string for the web request.

    The default user agent is similar to
    `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Microsoft Windows 10.0.15063; en-US) PowerShell/6.0.0` with slight
    variations for each operating system and platform.

    To test a website with the standard user agent string that is used by most internet browsers, use
    the properties of the [PSUserAgent](/dotnet/api/microsoft.powershell.commands.psuseragent) class,
    such as Chrome, FireFox, InternetExplorer, Opera, and Safari.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WebRequestSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WebSession
  description: |+
    Specifies a web request session. Enter the variable name, including the dollar sign (`$`).

    To override a value in the web request session, use a cmdlet parameter, such as **UserAgent** or
    **Credential**. Parameter values take precedence over values in the web request session. Content
    related headers, such as `Content-Type`, will be also be overridden when a
    **MultipartFormDataContent** object is supplied for **Body**.

    Unlike a remote session, the web request session isn't a persistent connection. It's an object that
    contains information about the connection and the request, including cookies, credentials, the
    maximum redirection value, and the user agent string. You can use it to share state and data among
    web requests.

    To create a web request session, enter a variable name, without a dollar sign, in the value of the
    **SessionVariable** parameter of an `Invoke-RestMethod` command. `Invoke-RestMethod` creates the
    session and saves it in the variable. In subsequent commands, use the variable as the value of the
    **WebSession** parameter.

    You can't use the **SessionVariable** and **WebSession** parameters in the same command.

  defaultValue: None

uid: Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.Invoke-RestMethod
name: Invoke-RestMethod
description: |-
  The `Invoke-RestMethod` cmdlet sends HTTP and HTTPS requests to Representational State Transfer
  (REST) web services that return richly structured data.

  PowerShell formats the response based to the data type. For an RSS or ATOM feed, PowerShell returns
  the Item or Entry XML nodes. For JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or XML, PowerShell converts, or
  deserializes, the content into objects.

  This cmdlet is introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  Beginning in PowerShell 7.0, `Invoke-RestMethod` supports proxy configuration defined by environment
  variables. See the [Notes](#notes) section of this article.
