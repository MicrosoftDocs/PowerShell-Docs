### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Deletes entries from the PowerShell session command history.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core
notes: |-
  The PowerShell session history is a list of the commands entered during a PowerShell session. You
  can view the history, add and delete commands, and run commands from the history. For more
  information, see [about_History](About/about_History.md).

  The session history is managed separately from the history maintained by the **PSReadLine** module.
  Both histories are available in sessions where **PSReadLine** is loaded. This cmdlet only works with
  the session history. For more information see, [about_PSReadLine](../PSReadLine/About/about_PSReadLine.md).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: CommandLine
  description: |+
    Deletes command history from a PowerShell session. The string must be an exact match or use
    wildcards to match commands in the PowerShell session history displayed by `Get-History`. If you
    enter more than one string, `Clear-History` deletes commands that match any of the strings. The
    **CommandLine** parameter can be used with **Count**.

    For strings with a space, use single quotations. For more information, see [about_Quoting_Rules](About/about_Quoting_Rules.md).

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the `Clear-History` cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Count
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of history entries that `Clear-History` deletes. Commands are deleted in order,
    beginning with the oldest entry in the history.

    The **Count** and **Id** parameters can be used together. The **Count** parameter specifies the
    number of commands to delete, inclusive of the specified **Id**. Beginning at the specified **Id**,
    commands are deleted in reverse sequential order. For example, if the **Id** is 30 and the **Count**
    is 10, `Clear-History` deletes items 21 through 30.

    The **Count** and **CommandLine** parameters can be used together. **Count** specifies the number of
    commands to delete that match **CommandLine** parameter value. The commands are deleted in
    sequential order.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Id
  description: |+
    Specifies the command history **Id** that `Clear-History` deletes. To display **Id** numbers, use
    the `Get-History` cmdlet. The **Id** numbers are sequential and commands keep their **Id** number
    throughout a PowerShell session. The **Id** parameter can be used with **Count** and **Newest**.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Newest
  description: |+
    When the **Newest** parameter is used, `Clear-History` deletes the newest entries in the history. By
    default, `Clear-History` deletes the oldest entries in the history.

    The **Newest** parameter can be used with **Id** and **Count**. The **Count** parameter specifies
    the number of commands to delete, inclusive of the specified **Id**. Beginning at the specified
    **Id**, commands are deleted in sequential order. For example, if the **Id** is 30 and the **Count**
    is 10, `Clear-History` deletes items 30 through 39.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""

    Shows what would happen if the `Clear-History` cmdlet runs. The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"

  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core.Clear-History
name: Clear-History
description: |-
  `Clear-History` deletes the command history from a PowerShell session. Each PowerShell session has
  its own command history. To display the command history, use the `Get-History` cmdlet.

  By default, `Clear-History` deletes the entire command history from a PowerShell session. You can
  use parameters with `Clear-History` to delete selected commands.

  `Clear-History` does not clear the `PSReadLine` command history file. The `PSReadLine` module stores
  a history file that contains every PowerShell command from every PowerShell session. From a
  PowerShell prompt, use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to scroll through the command
  history. To display the `PSReadLine` configuration for command history, use `Get-PSReadLineOption`.
  `PSReadLine` shipped with PowerShell 5.0 and above. For more information, see
  [about_PSReadLine](../PSReadLine/About/about_PSReadLine.md).
