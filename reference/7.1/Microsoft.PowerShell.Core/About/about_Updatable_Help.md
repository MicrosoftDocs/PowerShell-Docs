# About Updatable Help

## Short description
Describes the updatable help system in PowerShell.

## Long description

PowerShell provides several different ways to access the most up-to-date help
topics for PowerShell cmdlets and concepts.

The Updatable Help system, introduced in PowerShell 3.0, is designed to assure
that you always have the newest help topics on your local computer so that you
can read them at the command line. It makes it easy to download and install
help files and to update them whenever newer help files become available.

To provide updated help for multiple computers in an enterprise and for
computers that do not have access to the internet, Updatable Help lets you
download help files to a filesystem directory or file share, and then install
the help files from the file share.

In PowerShell 4.0, the **HelpInfoUri** property is preserved over Windows
PowerShell remoting, which allows `Save-Help` to work for modules that are
installed on a remote computer, but are not necessarily installed on the local
computer. You can save a **PSModuleInfo** object to disk or removable media
(such as a USB drive) by running `Export-Clixml` on a computer that does not
have internet access, importing the **PSModuleInfo** object on a computer that
does have internet access, and then running `Save-Help` on the **PSModuleInfo**
object. The saved help can be copied to the remote, disconnected computer by
using removable media, and then installed by running `Update-Help`. These
improvements in `Save-Help` functionality let you install help on computers
that are without any kind of network access. For an example of how to use the
new `Save-Help` functionality, see
[How to update help from a file share](#how-to-update-help-from-a-file-share)
in this topic.

Updatable Help also supports online access to the newest help topics and basic
help for cmdlets, even when there are no help files on the computer.

PowerShell 3.0 does not come with Help files. You can use the Updatable Help
feature to install the help files for all of the commands that are included by
default in PowerShell and for all Windows modules.

## Updatable help cmdlets

- `Update-Help`: Downloads the newest help files from the internet or a file
  share, and installs them on the local computer.

- `Save-Help`: Downloads the newest help files from the internet and saves them
  in a filesystem directory or file share. To install the help files on
  computers, use `Update-Help`.

- `Get-Help`: Displays help topics at the command line. Gets help from the help
  files on the computer. Displays auto-generated help for cmdlets and functions
  that do not have help files. Opens online help topics for cmdlets, functions,
  scripts, and workflows in your default internet browser.

## Auto-generated help: help without help files

If you do not have the help file for a cmdlet, function, or workflow on the
computer, the `Get-Help` cmdlet displays auto-generated help and prompts you to
download the help files or read them online.

Auto-generated help includes syntax and aliases, and remarks that explain how
to use the Updatable Help cmdlets and to access the online help topics.

For example, the following command gets basic help for the `Get-Culture`
cmdlet. The output shows the `Get-Help` display when there are no help files on
the computer.

```powershell
Get-Help Get-Culture
```

```output
NAME
    Get-Culture

SYNTAX
    Get-Culture [<CommonParameters>]

ALIASES
    None

REMARKS
    To get the latest Help content including descriptions and examples
    type: Update-Help.
```

## Help files for modules

The smallest unit of Updatable Help is help for a module. Module help includes
help for all of the cmdlets, functions, workflows, providers, scripts, and
concepts in a module. You can update help for all modules that are installed on
the computer, even if they are not imported into the current session.

You can update help for the entire module, but you cannot update help for
individual cmdlets.

To find the module that contains a particular cmdlet, use the following command
format:

```powershell
(Get-Command <cmdlet-name>).ModuleName
```

For example, to find the module that contains the `Set-ExecutionPolicy`
cmdlet, type:

```powershell
(Get-Command Set-ExecutionPolicy).ModuleName
```

To update help for a particular module, type:

```powershell
Update-Help -Module <ModuleName>
```

For example, to update help for the module that contains the
Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet, type:

```powershell
Update-Help -Module Microsoft.PowerShell.Security
```

## Permissions for updatable help

To update help for the modules in the directory `$pshome/Modules`, you must be
member of the Administrators group on the computer.

If you are not a member of the Administrators group, you cannot update help for
these modules; but if you have internet access, you can view help online.

Updating help for modules in the directory `$home/Documents/PowerShell/Modules`
or modules in other subdirectories of the `$home` directory does not require
special permissions.

The `Update-Help` and `Save-Help` cmdlets have a **UseDefaultCredentials**
parameter that provides the explicit credentials of the current user. This
parameter is designed for accessing secure internet locations.

The `Update-Help` and `Save-Help` cmdlets also have a **Credential** parameter
that allows you to run the command on a remote computer and access a file share
on a third computer. The **Credential** parameter is valid only when you use
the SourcePath or **LiteralPath** parameters of `Update-Help` and the
**DestinationPath** or **LiteralPath** parameters of `Save-Help`.

## How to install and update help files

To download and install help files for the first time, or to update the help
files on your computer, use the `Update-Help` cmdlet.

The `Update-Help` cmdlet does all of the hard work for you, including the
following tasks.

- Determines which modules support Updatable Help.
- Finds the internet location where each module stores its Updatable Help
  files.
- Compares the help files for each module on your computer to the newest help
  files that are available for each module.
- Downloads the new files from the internet.
- Unwraps the help file package.
- Verifies that the files are valid help files.
- Installs the help files in the language-specific subdirectory of the module
  directory.

To access the new help topics, use the `Get-Help` cmdlet. You do not need to
restart PowerShell.

To install or update help for all modules on the computer that supports
Updatable Help, type:

```powershell
Update-Help
```

To update help for particular modules, add the **Module** parameter of
`Update-Help`. Wildcard characters are permitted in the module name.

For example, to update help for the ServerManager module, type:

```powershell
Update-Help -Module ServerManager
```

Without parameters, `Update-Help` updates help for all modules in the session
and for all installed modules that support Updatable Help. To be included,
modules must be installed in directories that are listed in the value of the
PSModulePath environment variable. These are also modules that are returned by
a "Get-Help -ListAvailable" command.

If the value of the **Module** parameter is `*` (all), `Update-Help` attempts
to update help for all installed modules, including modules that do not support
Updatable Help. This command typically generates many errors as the cmdlet
encounters modules that do not support Updatable Help.

## How to update help from a file share

To support computers that are not connected to the internet, or to control or
streamline help updating in an enterprise, use the `Save-Help` cmdlet. The
`Save-Help` cmdlet downloads help files from the internet and saves them in a
filesystem directory that you specify.

`Save-Help` compares the help files in the specified directory to the newest
help files that are available for each module. If the directory has no help
files or newer help files are available for the module, the `Save-Help` cmdlet
downloads the new files from the internet. However, it does not unwrap or
install the help files.

To install or update the help files on a computer from help files that were
saved to a filesystem directory, use the **SourcePath** parameter of the
`Update-Help` cmdlet. The `Update-Help` cmdlet identifies the newest help
files, unwraps and validates them, and installs them in the language-specific
subdirectories of the module directories.

For example, to save help for all installed modules to the `\\Server\Share`
directory, type:

```powershell
Save-Help -DestinationPath \\Server\Share
```

Then, to update help from the `\\Server\Share` directory, type:

```powershell
Update-Help -SourcePath \\Server\Share
```

The following examples show the use of `Save-Help` to save help for modules
that are not installed on the local computer. In this example, the
administrator runs `Save-Help` to save the help for the DhcpServer module from
an internet-connected client computer, without installing the DhcpServer module
or DHCP Server role on the local computer.

Option 1: Run `Invoke-Command` to get the **PSModuleInfo** object for the
remote module, save it in a variable, `$m`, and then run `Save-Help` on the
**PSModuleInfo** object by specifying the variable `$m` as the module name.

```powershell
$m = Invoke-Command -ComputerName RemoteServer -ScriptBlock
{ Get-Module -Name DhcpServer -ListAvailable }
Save-Help -Module $m -DestinationPath C:\SavedHelp
```

Option 2: Open a PSSession targeted at the computer that is running the DHCP
Server module, to get the **PSModuleInfo** object for the module, save it in a
variable `$m`, and then run `Save-Help` on the object that is saved in the `$m`
variable.

```powershell
$s = New-PSSession -ComputerName RemoteServer
$m = Get-Module -PSSession $s -Name DhcpServer -ListAvailable
Save-Help -Module $m -DestinationPath C:\SavedHelp
```

Option 3: Open a CIM session, targeted at the computer that is running the DHCP
Server module, to get the **PSModuleInfo** object for the module, save it in a
variable `$m`, and then run `Save-Help` on the object that is saved in the `$m`
variable.

```powershell
$c = New-CimSession -ComputerName RemoteServer
$m = Get-Module -CimSession $c -Name DhcpServer -ListAvailable
Save-Help -Module $m -DestinationPath C:\SavedHelp
```

In the following example, the administrator installs help for the DHCP Server
module on a computer that does not have network access.

First, run `Export-Clixml` to export the **PSModuleInfo** object to a shared
folder or to removable media.

```powershell
$m = Get-Module -Name DhcpServer -ListAvailable
Export-Clixml -Path E:\UsbFlashDrive\DhcpModule.xml -InputObject $m
```

Next, transport the removable media to a computer that has internet access, and
then import the **PSModuleInfo** object with `Import-Clixml`. Run `Save-Help`
to save the Help for the imported DhcpServer module **PSModuleInfo** object.

```powershell
$deserialized_m = Import-Clixml E:\UsbFlashDrive\DhcpModule.xml
Save-Help -Module $deserialized_m -DestinationPath E:\UsbFlashDrive\SavedHelp
```

Finally, transport the removable media back to the computer that does not have
network access, and then install the help by running `Update-Help`.

```powershell
Update-Help -Module DhcpServer -SourcePath E:\UsbFlashDrive\SavedHelp
```

Without parameters, `Save-Help` downloads help for all modules in the session
and for all installed modules that support Updatable Help. To be included,
modules must be installed in directories that are listed in the value of the
`$env:PSModulePath` environment variable, on either the local computer or on a remote
computer for which you want to save help. These are also modules that are
returned by running a `Get-Help -ListAvailable` command.

## How to update help files in different languages

By default, the `Update-Help` and `Save-Help` cmdlets download help in the UI
culture and language that is set for Windows on the local computer. If help
files for the specified modules are not available in the local UI culture,
`Update-Help` and `Save-Help` use the Windows language fallback rules to find
the best supported language.

However, you can use the **UICulture** parameters of the `Update-Help` and
`Save-Help` cmdlets to download and install help files in any UI cultures in
which they are available.

For example, to save the newest help files for all modules on the session in
Japanese (Ja-jp) and French (fr-FR), type:

```powershell
Save-Help -Path \Server\Share -UICulture ja-jp, fr-fr
```

If help files for the modules are not available in the languages that you
specified, the `Update-Help` and `Save-Help` cmdlets return an error message
that lists the languages in which help for each module is available so you can
choose the alternative that best meets your needs.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, Updateable Help content is only published in English (en-US). On
> some non-Windows systems you must use the **UICulture** parameter to
> explicitly request the `en-US` content.

## How to use online help

If you cannot or choose not to update the help files on your local computer,
you can still get the newest help files online.

To open the online help topic for any cmdlet or function, use the **Online**
parameter of the `Get-Help` cmdlet.

For example, the following command opens the online help topic for the
`Get-Job` cmdlet in your default internet browser:

```powershell
Get-Help Get-Job -Online
```

To get online help for a script, use the **Online** parameter and the full path
to the script.

The **Online** parameter does not work with About topics. To see the about
topics for PowerShell, including help topics about the PowerShell language, see
[PowerShell About Topics](about.md).

## How to minimize or prevent internet downloads

To minimize internet downloads and provide Updatable Help to users who are not
connected to the internet, use the `Save-Help` cmdlet. Download help from the
internet and save it to a network share. Then, create a Group Policy setting or
scheduled job that runs an `Update-Help` command on all computers. Set the
value of the **SourcePath** parameter of the `Update-Help` cmdlet to the
network share.

To prevent users who have internet access from downloading Updatable Help from
the internet, use the **Set the default source path for Update-Help** Group
Policy setting.

This Group Policy setting implicitly adds the **SourcePath** parameter, with
the filesystem location that you specify, to every `Update-Help` command on
every affected computer. Users can use the **SourcePath** parameter explicitly
to specify a different filesystem location, but they cannot exclude the
**SourcePath** parameter and download help from the internet.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Set the default source path for Update-Help** group policy setting
> appears under **Computer Configuration** and **User Configuration**. However,
> only the policy setting under **Computer Configuration** is effective. The
> policy setting under **User Configuration** is ignored.

For more information, see
[about_Group_Policy_Settings](about_Group_Policy_Settings.md).

## How to update help for non-standard modules

To update or save help for a module that is not returned by the
**ListAvailable** parameter of the `Get-Module` cmdlet, import the module into
the current session before running an `Update-Help` or `Save-Help` command. On
a remote computer, before running the `Save-Help` command, import the module
into the current Session, or `Invoke-Command` script block, that is connected
to the remote computer.

When the module is in the current session, run the `Update-Help` or `Save-Help`
cmdlets without parameters, or use the **Module** parameter to specify the
module name.

The **Module** parameters of the `Update-Help` and `Save-Help` cmdlets accept
only a module name. They do not accept the path to a module file.

Use this technique to update or save help for any module that is not returned
by the **ListAvailable** parameter of the `Get-Module` cmdlet, such as a module
that is installed in a location that is not listed in the `$env:PSModulePath`
environment variable, or a module that is not well-formed (the module directory
does not contain at least one file whose basename is the same as the directory
name).

## How to support updatable help

If you author a module, you can support online help and Updatable Help for your
modules. For more information, see
[Supporting Updatable Help](/powershell/scripting/developer/help/supporting-updatable-help)
and [Supporting Online Help](/powershell/scripting/developer/module/supporting-online-help)
in the Microsoft Docs.

Updatable help not available for PowerShell snap-ins or comment-based help.

## Remarks

The `Update-Help` and `Save-Help` cmdlets are not supported on Windows
Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE).
