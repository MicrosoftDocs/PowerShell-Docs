# About Aliases

## SHORT DESCRIPTION
Describes how to use alternate names for cmdlets and commands in
PowerShell.

## LONG DESCRIPTION

An alias is an alternate name or nickname for a cmdlet or for a command
element, such as a function, script, file, or executable file. You can use the
alias instead of the command name in any PowerShell commands.

To create an alias, use the New-Alias cmdlet. For example, the following
command creates the "gas" alias for the `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` cmdlet:

```powershell
New-Alias -Name gas -Value Get-AuthenticodeSignature
```

After you create the alias for the cmdlet name, you can use the alias instead
of the cmdlet name. For example, to get the Authenticode signature for the
SqlScript.ps1 file, type:

```powershell
Get-AuthenticodeSignature SqlScript.ps1
```

Or, type:

```powershell
gas SqlScript.ps1
```

If you create "word" as the alias for Microsoft Office Word, you can type
"word" instead of the following:

```powershell
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office11\Winword.exe"
```

## BUILT-IN ALIASES

PowerShell includes a set of built-in aliases, including "cd" and "chdir" for
the Set-Location cmdlet, and "ls" and "dir" for the Get-ChildItem cmdlet.

To get all the aliases on the computer, including the built-in aliases, type:

```powershell
Get-Alias
```

## ALIAS CMDLETS

PowerShell includes the following cmdlets, which are designed for working with
aliases:

- `Get-Alias` - Gets all the aliases in the current session.
- `New-Alias` - Creates a new alias.
- `Set-Alias` - Creates or changes an alias.
- `Export-Alias` - Exports one or more aliases to a file.
- `Import-Alias` - Imports an alias file into PowerShell.

For detailed information about the cmdlets, type:

```powershell
Get-Help <cmdlet-Name> -Detailed
```

For example, type:

```powershell
Get-Help Export-Alias -Detailed
```

## CREATING AN ALIAS

To create a new alias, use the New-Alias cmdlet. For example, to create the
"gh" alias for Get-Help, type:

```powershell
New-Alias -Name gh -Value Get-Help
```

You can use the alias in commands, just as you would use the full cmdlet name,
and you can use the alias with parameters.

For example, to get detailed Help for the Get-WmiObject cmdlet, type:

```powershell
Get-Help Get-WmiObject -Detailed
```

Or, type:

```powershell
gh Get-WmiObject -Detailed
```

## SAVING ALIASES

The aliases that you create are saved only in the current session. To use the
aliases in a different session, add the alias to your PowerShell profile. Or,
use the Export-Alias cmdlet to save the aliases to a file.

For more information, type:

```powershell
Get-Help about_Profiles
```

## GETTING ALIASES

To get all the aliases in the current session, including the built-in aliases,
the aliases in your PowerShell profiles, and the aliases that you have created
in the current session, type:

```powershell
Get-Alias
```

To get particular aliases, use the Name parameter of the Get-Alias cmdlet. For
example, to get aliases that begin with "p", type:

```powershell
Get-Alias -Name p*
```

To get the aliases for a particular item, use the Definition parameter. For
example, to get the aliases for the Get-ChildItem cmdlet type:

```powershell
Get-Alias -Definition Get-ChildItem
```

### GET-ALIAS OUTPUT

Get-Alias returns only one type of object, an AliasInfo object
(System.Management.Automation.AliasInfo). The name of aliases that don't
include a hyphen, such as "cd" are displayed in the following format:

```powershell
Get-Alias ac
```

```Output
CommandType     Name                    Version    Source
-----------     ----                    -------    ------
Alias           ac -> Add-Content
```

This makes it very quick and easy to get the information that you need.

The arrow-based alias name format is not used for aliases that include a
hyphen. These are likely to be preferred substitute names for cmdlets and
functions, instead of typical abbreviations or nicknames, and the author might
not want them to be as evident.

## ALTERNATE NAMES FOR COMMANDS WITH PARAMETERS

You can assign an alias to a cmdlet, script, function, or executable file. You
cannot assign an alias to a command and its parameters. For example, you can
assign an alias to the `Get-Eventlog` cmdlet, but you cannot assign an alias
to the `Get-Eventlog -LogName System` command.

You can create a function that includes the command. To create a function,
type the word "function" followed by a name for the function. Type the
command, and enclose it in braces ({}).

For example, the following command creates the syslog function. This function
represents the `Get-Eventlog -LogName System` command:

```powershell
function Get-SystemEventlog {Get-Eventlog -LogName System}
Set-Alias -Name syslog -Value Get-SystemEventlog
```

You can now type "syslog" instead of the command. And, you can create aliases
for the new function.

For more information about functions, type:

```powershell
Get-Help about_Functions
```

## ALIAS OBJECTS

PowerShell aliases are represented by objects that are instances of the
System.Management.Automation.AliasInfo class. For more information about this
type of object, see [AliasInfo Class][aliasinfo] in the Microsoft Developer
Network (MSDN) library.

To view the properties and methods of the alias objects, get the aliases.
Then, pipe them to the Get-Member cmdlet. For example:

```powershell
Get-Alias | Get-Member
```

To view the values of the properties of a specific alias, such as the `dir`
alias, get the alias. Then, pipe it to the Format-List cmdlet. For example,
the following command gets the "dir" alias. Next, the command pipes the alias
to the Format-List cmdlet. Then, the command uses the Property parameter of
Format-List with a wildcard character (\*) to display all the properties of
the `dir` alias. The following command performs these tasks:

```powershell
Get-Alias -Name dir | Format-List -Property *
```

## PowerShell ALIAS PROVIDER

PowerShell includes the Alias provider. The Alias provider lets you view the
aliases in PowerShell as though they were on a file system drive.

The Alias provider exposes the Alias: drive. To go into the Alias: drive,
type:

```powershell
Set-Location Alias:
```

To view the contents of the drive, type:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem
```

To view the contents of the drive from another PowerShell drive, begin the
path with the drive name. Include the colon (:). For example:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path Alias:
```

To get information about a particular alias, type the drive name and the alias
name. Or, type a name pattern. For example, to get all the aliases that begin
with "p", type:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path Alias:p*
```

For more information about the PowerShell Alias provider, type:

```powershell
Get-Help Alias
```
