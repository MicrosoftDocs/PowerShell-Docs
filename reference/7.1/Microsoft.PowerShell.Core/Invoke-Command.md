## DESCRIPTION

The `Invoke-Command` cmdlet runs commands on a local or remote computer and returns all output from
the commands, including errors. Using a single `Invoke-Command` command, you can run commands on
multiple computers.

To run a single command on a remote computer, use the **ComputerName** parameter. To run a series of
related commands that share data, use the `New-PSSession` cmdlet to create a **PSSession** (a
persistent connection) on the remote computer, and then use the **Session** parameter of
`Invoke-Command` to run the command in the **PSSession**. To run a command in a disconnected
session, use the **InDisconnectedSession** parameter. To run a command in a background job, use the
**AsJob** parameter.

You can also use `Invoke-Command` on a local computer to a script block as a command. PowerShell
runs the script block immediately in a child scope of the current scope.

Before using `Invoke-Command` to run commands on a remote computer, read [about_Remote](./About/about_Remote.md).

Starting with PowerShell 6.0 you can use Secure Shell (SSH) to establish a connection to and invoke
commands on remote computers. SSH must be installed on the local computer and the remote computer
must be configured with a PowerShell SSH endpoint. The benefit of an SSH based PowerShell remote
session is that it works across multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS). For SSH based session
you use the **HostName** or **SSHConnection** parameters to specify the remote computer and relevant
connection information. For more information about how to set up PowerShell SSH remoting, see
[PowerShell Remoting Over SSH](/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/ssh-remoting-in-powershell-core).

Some code samples use splatting to reduce the line length. For more information, see [about_Splatting](./About/about_Splatting.md).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Run a script on a server

This example runs the `Test.ps1` script on the Server01 computer.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -FilePath c:\scripts\test.ps1 -ComputerName Server01
```

The **FilePath** parameter specifies a script that is located on the local computer. The script runs
on the remote computer and the results are returned to the local computer.

### Example 2: Run a command on a remote server

This example runs a `Get-Culture` command on the Server01 remote computer.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server01 -Credential Domain01\User01 -ScriptBlock { Get-Culture }
```

The **ComputerName** parameter specifies the name of the remote computer. The **Credential**
parameter is used to run the command in the security context of Domain01\User01, a user who has
permission to run commands. The **ScriptBlock** parameter specifies the command to be run on the
remote computer.

In response, PowerShell requests the password and an authentication method for the User01 account.
It then runs the command on the Server01 computer and returns the result.

### Example 3: Run a command in a persistent connection

This example runs the same `Get-Culture` command in a session, using a persistent connection, on the
remote computer named Server02.

```powershell
$s = New-PSSession -ComputerName Server02 -Credential Domain01\User01
Invoke-Command -Session $s -ScriptBlock {Get-Culture}
```

The `New-PSSession` cmdlet creates a session on the Server02 remote computer and saves it in the
`$s` variable. Typically, you create a session only when you run a series of commands on the remote
computer.

The `Invoke-Command` cmdlet runs the `Get-Culture` command on Server02. The **Session** parameter
specifies the session saved in the `$s` variable.

In response, PowerShell runs the command in the session on the Server02 computer.

### Example 4: Use a session to run a series of commands that share data

This example compares the effects of using **ComputerName** and **Session** parameters of
`Invoke-Command`. It shows how to use a session to run a series of commands that share the same
data.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server02 -ScriptBlock {$p = Get-Process PowerShell}
Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server02 -ScriptBlock {$p.VirtualMemorySize}
$s = New-PSSession -ComputerName Server02
Invoke-Command -Session $s -ScriptBlock {$p = Get-Process PowerShell}
Invoke-Command -Session $s -ScriptBlock {$p.VirtualMemorySize}
```

```Output
17930240
```

The first two commands use the **ComputerName** parameter of `Invoke-Command` to run commands on the
Server02 remote computer. The first command uses the `Get-Process` cmdlet to get the PowerShell
process on the remote computer and to save it in the `$p` variable. The second command gets the
value of the **VirtualMemorySize** property of the PowerShell process.

When you use the **ComputerName** parameter, PowerShell creates a new session to run the command.
The session is closed when the command completes. The `$p` variable was created in one connection,
but it doesn't exist in the connection created for the second command.

The problem is solved by creating a persistent session on the remote computer, then running both of
the commands in the same session.

The `New-PSSession` cmdlet creates a persistent session on the computer Server02 and saves the
session in the `$s` variable. The `Invoke-Command` lines that follow use the **Session** parameter
to run both of the commands in the same session. Since both commands run in the same session, the
`$p` value remains active.

### Example 5: Enter a command stored in a local variable

This example shows how to create a command that is stored as a script block in a local variable.
When the script block is saved in a local variable, you can specify the variable as the value of the
**ScriptBlock** parameter.

```powershell
$command = { Get-WinEvent -LogName PowerShellCore/Operational |
  Where-Object {$_.Message -like "*certificate*"} }
Invoke-Command -ComputerName S1, S2 -ScriptBlock $command
```

The `$command` variable stores the `Get-WinEvent` command that's formatted as a script block. The
`Invoke-Command` runs the command stored in `$command` on the S1 and S2 remote computers.

### Example 6: Run a single command on several computers

This example demonstrates how to use `Invoke-Command` to run a single command on multiple computers.

```powershell
$parameters = @{
  ComputerName = "Server01", "Server02", "TST-0143", "localhost"
  ConfigurationName = 'MySession.PowerShell'
  ScriptBlock = { Get-WinEvent -LogName PowerShellCore/Operational }
}
Invoke-Command @parameters
```

The **ComputerName** parameter specifies a comma-separated list of computer names. The list of
computers includes the localhost value, which represents the local computer. The
**ConfigurationName** parameter specifies an alternate session configuration. The **ScriptBlock**
parameter runs `Get-WinEvent` to get the PowerShellCore/Operational event logs from each computer.

### Example 7: Get the version of the host program on multiple computers

This example gets the version of the PowerShell host program running on 200 remote computers.

```powershell
$version = Invoke-Command -ComputerName (Get-Content Machines.txt) -ScriptBlock {(Get-Host).Version}
```

Because only one command is run, you don't have to create persistent connections to each of the
computers. Instead, the command uses the **ComputerName** parameter to indicate the computers. To
specify the computers, it uses the `Get-Content` cmdlet to get the contents of the Machine.txt file,
a file of computer names.

The `Invoke-Command` cmdlet runs a `Get-Host` command on the remote computers. It uses dot notation
to get the **Version** property of the PowerShell host.

These commands run one at a time. When the commands complete, the output of the commands from all of
the computers is saved in the `$version` variable. The output includes the name of the computer from
which the data originated.

### Example 8: Run a background job on several remote computers

This example runs a command on two remote computers. The `Invoke-Command` command uses the **AsJob**
parameter so that the command runs as a background job. The commands run on the remote computers,
but the job exists on the local computer. The results are transmitted to the local computer.

```powershell
$s = New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01, Server02
Invoke-Command -Session $s -ScriptBlock {Get-EventLog system} -AsJob
```

```Output
Id   Name    State      HasMoreData   Location           Command
---  ----    -----      -----         -----------        ---------------
1    Job1    Running    True          Server01,Server02  Get-EventLog system
```

```powershell
$j = Get-Job
$j | Format-List -Property *
```

```Output
HasMoreData   : True
StatusMessage :
Location      : Server01,Server02
Command       : Get-EventLog system
JobStateInfo  : Running
Finished      : System.Threading.ManualResetEvent
InstanceId    : e124bb59-8cb2-498b-a0d2-2e07d4e030ca
Id            : 1
Name          : Job1
ChildJobs     : {Job2, Job3}
Output        : {}
Error         : {}
Progress      : {}
Verbose       : {}
Debug         : {}
Warning       : {}
StateChanged  :
```

```powershell
$results = $j | Receive-Job
```

The `New-PSSession` cmdlet creates sessions on the Server01 and Server02 remote computers. The
`Invoke-Command` cmdlet runs a background job in each of the sessions. The command uses the
**AsJob** parameter to run the command as a background job. This command returns a job object that
contains two child job objects, one for each of the jobs run on the two remote computers.

The `Get-Job` command saves the job object in the `$j` variable. The `$j` variable is then piped to
the `Format-List` cmdlet to display all properties of the job object in a list. The last command
gets the results of the jobs. It pipes the job object in `$j` to the `Receive-Job` cmdlet and stores
the results in the `$results` variable.

### Example 9: Include local variables in a command run on a remote computer

This example shows how to include the values of local variables in a command run on a remote
computer. The command uses the `Using` scope modifier to identify a local variable in a remote
command. By default, all variables are assumed to be defined in the remote session. The `Using`
scope modifier was introduced in PowerShell 3.0. For more information about the `Using` scope
modifier, see [about_Remote_Variables](./About/about_Remote_Variables.md) and [about_Scopes](./about/about_scopes.md).

```powershell
$Log = "PowerShellCore/Operational"
Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server01 -ScriptBlock {Get-WinEvent -LogName $Using:Log -MaxEvents 10}
```

The `$Log` variable stores the name of the event log, PowerShellCore/Operational. The
`Invoke-Command` cmdlet runs `Get-WinEvent` on Server01 to get the ten newest events from the event
log. The value of the **LogName** parameter is the `$Log` variable that is prefixed by the `Using`
scope modifier to indicate that it was created in the local session, not in the remote session.

### Example 10: Hide the computer name

This example shows the effect of using the **HideComputerName** parameter of `Invoke-Command`.
**HideComputerName** doesn't change the object that this cmdlet returns. It changes only the
display. You can still use the **Format** cmdlets to display the **PsComputerName** property of any
of the affected objects.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName S1, S2 -ScriptBlock {Get-Process PowerShell}
```

```Output
PSComputerName    Handles  NPM(K)    PM(K)      WS(K) VM(M)   CPU(s)     Id   ProcessName
--------------    -------  ------    -----      ----- -----   ------     --   -----------
S1                575      15        45100      40988   200     4.68     1392 PowerShell
S2                777      14        35100      30988   150     3.68     67   PowerShell
```

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName S1, S2 -ScriptBlock {Get-Process PowerShell} -HideComputerName
```

```Output
Handles  NPM(K)    PM(K)      WS(K) VM(M)   CPU(s)     Id   ProcessName
-------  ------    -----      ----- -----   ------     --   -----------
575      15        45100      40988   200     4.68     1392 PowerShell
777      14        35100      30988   150     3.68     67   PowerShell
```

The first two commands use `Invoke-Command` to run a `Get-Process` command for the PowerShell
process. The output of the first command includes the **PsComputerName** property, which contains
the name of the computer on which the command ran. The output of the second command, which uses
**HideComputerName**, doesn't include the **PsComputerName** column.

### Example 11: Use the Param keyword in a script block

The `Param` keyword and the **ArgumentList** parameter are used to pass variable values to named
parameters in a script block. This example displays filenames that begin with the letter `a` and
have the `.pdf` extension.

For more information about the `Param` keyword, see
[about_Language_Keywords](./about/about_language_keywords.md#param).

```powershell
$parameters = @{
    ComputerName = "Server01"
    ScriptBlock = { Param ($param1,$param2) Get-ChildItem -Name $param1 -Include $param2 }
    ArgumentList = "a*", "*.pdf"
}
Invoke-Command @parameters
```

```Output
aa.pdf
ab.pdf
ac.pdf
az.pdf
```

`Invoke-Command` uses the **ScriptBlock** parameter that defines two variables, `$param1` and
`$param2`. `Get-ChildItem` uses the named parameters, **Name** and **Include** with the variable
names. The **ArgumentList** passes the values to the variables.

### Example 12: Use the $args automatic variable in a script block

The `$args` automatic variable and the **ArgumentList** parameter are used to pass array values to
parameter positions in a script block. This example displays a server's directory contents of `.txt`
files. The `Get-ChildItem` **Path** parameter is position 0 and the **Filter** parameter is position
1.

For more information about the `$args` variable, see
[about_Automatic_Variables](./about/about_automatic_variables.md#args)

```powershell
$parameters = @{
    ComputerName = "Server01"
    ScriptBlock = { Get-ChildItem $args[0] $args[1] }
    ArgumentList = "C:\Test", "*.txt*"
}
Invoke-Command @parameters
```

```Output
    Directory: C:\Test

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a---           6/12/2019    15:15            128 alog.txt
-a---           7/27/2019    15:16            256 blog.txt
-a---           9/28/2019    17:10             64 zlog.txt
```

`Invoke-Command` uses a **ScriptBlock** parameter and `Get-ChildItem` specifies the `$args[0]` and
`$args[1]` array values. The **ArgumentList** passes the `$args` array values to the `Get-ChildItem`
parameter positions for **Path** and **Filter**.

### Example 13: Run a script on all the computers listed in a text file

This example uses the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet to run the `Sample.ps1` script on all the computers
listed in the `Servers.txt` file. The command uses the **FilePath** parameter to specify the script
file. This command lets you run the script on the remote computers, even if the script file isn't
accessible to the remote computers.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName (Get-Content Servers.txt) -FilePath C:\Scripts\Sample.ps1 -ArgumentList Process, Service
```

When you submit the command, the content of the `Sample.ps1` file is copied into a script block and
the script block is run on each of the remote computers. This procedure is equivalent to using the
**ScriptBlock** parameter to submit the contents of the script.

### Example 14: Run a command on a remote computer using a URI

This example shows how to run a command on a remote computer that's identified by a Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI). This particular example runs a `Set-Mailbox` command on a remote Exchange server.

```powershell
$LiveCred = Get-Credential
$parameters = @{
  ConfigurationName = 'Microsoft.Exchange'
  ConnectionUri = 'https://ps.exchangelabs.com/PowerShell'
  Credential = $LiveCred
  Authentication = 'Basic'
  ScriptBlock = {Set-Mailbox Dan -DisplayName "Dan Park"}
}
Invoke-Command @parameters
```

The first line uses the `Get-Credential` cmdlet to store Windows Live ID credentials in the
`$LiveCred` variable. PowerShell prompts the user to enter Windows Live ID credentials.

The `$parameters` variable is a hash table containing the parameters to be passed to the
`Invoke-Command` cmdlet. The `Invoke-Command` cmdlet runs a `Set-Mailbox` command using the
**Microsoft.Exchange** session configuration. The **ConnectionURI** parameter specifies the URL of
the Exchange server endpoint. The **Credential** parameter specifies the credentials stored in the
`$LiveCred` variable. The **AuthenticationMechanism** parameter specifies the use of basic
authentication. The **ScriptBlock** parameter specifies a script block that contains the command.

### Example 15: Use a session option

This example shows how to create and use a **SessionOption** parameter.

```powershell
$so = New-PSSessionOption -SkipCACheck -SkipCNCheck -SkipRevocationCheck
Invoke-Command -ComputerName server01 -UseSSL -ScriptBlock { Get-HotFix } -SessionOption $so -Credential server01\user01
```

The `New-PSSessionOption` cmdlet creates a session option object that causes the remote end not to
verify the Certificate Authority, Canonical Name, and Revocation Lists while evaluating the incoming
HTTPS connection. The **SessionOption** object is saved in the `$so` variable.

> [!NOTE]
> Disabling these checks is convenient for troubleshooting, but obviously not secure.

The `Invoke-Command` cmdlet runs a `Get-HotFix` command remotely. The **SessionOption** parameter is
given the `$so` variable.

### Example 16: Manage URI redirection in a remote command

This example shows how to use the **AllowRedirection** and **SessionOption** parameters to manage
URI redirection in a remote command.

```powershell
$max = New-PSSessionOption -MaximumRedirection 1
$parameters = @{
  ConnectionUri = "https://ps.exchangelabs.com/PowerShell"
  ScriptBlock = { Get-Mailbox dan }
  AllowRedirection = $true
  SessionOption = $max
}
Invoke-Command @parameters
```

The `New-PSSessionOption` cmdlet creates a **PSSessionOption** object that is saved in the `$max`
variable. The command uses the **MaximumRedirection** parameter to set the
**MaximumConnectionRedirectionCount** property of the **PSSessionOption** object to 1.

The `Invoke-Command` cmdlet runs a `Get-Mailbox` command on a remote Microsoft Exchange Server. The
**AllowRedirection** parameter provides explicit permission to redirect the connection to an
alternate endpoint. The **SessionOption** parameter uses the session object stored in the `$max`
variable.

As a result, if the remote computer specified by **ConnectionURI** returns a redirection message,
PowerShell redirects the connection, but if the new destination returns another redirection message,
the redirection count value of 1 is exceeded, and `Invoke-Command` returns a non-terminating error.

### Example 17: Access a network share in a remote session

This example shows how to access a network share from a remote session. Three computers are used to
demonstrate the example. Server01 is the local computer, Server02 is the remote computer, and Net03
contains the network share. Server01 connects to Server02, and then Server02 does a second hop to
Net03 to access the network share. For more information about how PowerShell Remoting supports hops
between computers, see
[Making the second hop in PowerShell Remoting](/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/ps-remoting-second-hop).

The required Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) delegation is enabled in the client
settings on the local computer, and in the service settings on the remote computer. To run the
commands in this example, you must be a member of the **Administrators** group on the local computer
and the remote computer.

```powershell
Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role Client -DelegateComputer Server02
$s = New-PSSession Server02
Invoke-Command -Session $s -ScriptBlock {Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role Server -Force}
$parameters = @{
  Session = $s
  ScriptBlock = { Get-Item \\Net03\Scripts\LogFiles.ps1 }
  Authentication = "CredSSP"
  Credential = "Domain01\Admin01"
}
Invoke-Command @parameters
```

The `Enable-WSManCredSSP` cmdlet enables CredSSP delegation from the Server01 local computer to the
Server02 remote computer. The **Role** parameter specifies **Client** to configure the CredSSP
client setting on the local computer.

`New-PSSession` creates a **PSSession** object for Server02 and stores the object in the `$s`
variable.

The `Invoke-Command` cmdlet uses the `$s` variable to connect to the remote computer, Server02. The
**ScriptBlock** parameter runs `Enable-WSManCredSSP` on the remote computer. The **Role** parameter
specifies **Server** to configure the CredSSP server setting on the remote computer.

The `$parameters` variable contains the parameter values to connect to the network share. The
`Invoke-Command` cmdlet runs a `Get-Item` command in the session in `$s`. This command gets a script
from the `\\Net03\Scripts` network share. The command uses the **Authentication** parameter with a
value of **CredSSP** and the **Credential** parameter with a value of **Domain01\Admin01**.

### Example 18: Start scripts on many remote computers

This example runs a script on more than a hundred computers. To minimize the impact on the local
computer, it connects to each computer, starts the script, and then disconnects from each computer.
The script continues to run in the disconnected sessions.

```powershell
$parameters = @{
  ComputerName = (Get-Content -Path C:\Test\Servers.txt)
  InDisconnectedSession = $true
  FilePath = "\\Scripts\Public\ConfigInventory.ps1"
  SessionOption = @{OutputBufferingMode="Drop";IdleTimeout=43200000}
}
Invoke-Command @parameters
```

The command uses `Invoke-Command` to run the script. The value of the **ComputerName** parameter is
a `Get-Content` command that gets the names of the remote computers from a text file. The
**InDisconnectedSession** parameter disconnects the sessions as soon as it starts the command. The
value of the **FilePath** parameter is the script that `Invoke-Command` runs on each computer.

The value of **SessionOption** is a hash table. The **OutputBufferingMode** value is set to **Drop**
and the **IdleTimeout** value is set to **43200000** milliseconds (12 hours).

To get the results of commands and scripts that run in disconnected sessions, use the
`Receive-PSSession` cmdlet.

### Example 19: Run a command on a remote computer using SSH

This example shows how to run a command on a remote computer using Secure Shell (SSH). If SSH is
configured on the remote computer to prompt for passwords, then you'll get a password prompt.
Otherwise, you'll have to use SSH key-based user authentication.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -HostName UserA@LinuxServer01 -ScriptBlock { Get-MailBox * }
```

### Example 20: Run a command on a remote computer using SSH and specify a user authentication key

This example shows how to run a command on a remote computer using SSH and specifying a key file for
user authentication. You won't be prompted for a password unless the key authentication fails and
the remote computer is configured to allow basic password authentication.

```powershell
Invoke-Command -HostName UserA@LinuxServer01 -ScriptBlock { Get-MailBox * } -KeyFilePath /UserA/UserAKey_rsa
```

### Example 21: Run a script file on multiple remote computers using SSH as a job

This example shows how to run a script file on multiple remote computers using SSH and the
**SSHConnection** parameter set. The **SSHConnection** parameter takes an array of hash tables that
contain connection information for each computer. This example requires that the target remote
computers have SSH configured to support key-based user authentication.

```powershell
$sshConnections =
@{ HostName="WinServer1"; UserName="Domain\UserA"; KeyFilePath="C:\Users\UserA\id_rsa" },
@{ HostName="UserB@LinuxServer5"; KeyFilePath="/Users/UserB/id_rsa" }
$results = Invoke-Command -FilePath c:\Scripts\CollectEvents.ps1 -SSHConnection $sshConnections
```

## PARAMETERS

### -AllowRedirection

Allows redirection of this connection to an alternate Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

When you use the **ConnectionURI** parameter, the remote destination can return an instruction to
redirect to a different URI. By default, PowerShell doesn't redirect connections, but you can use
this parameter to allow it to redirect the connection.

You can also limit the number of times the connection is redirected by changing the
**MaximumConnectionRedirectionCount** session option value. Use the **MaximumRedirection** parameter
of the `New-PSSessionOption` cmdlet or set the **MaximumConnectionRedirectionCount** property of the
`$PSSessionOption` preference variable. The default value is 5.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: Uri, FilePathUri
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ApplicationName

Specifies the application name segment of the connection URI. Use this parameter to specify the
application name when you aren't using the **ConnectionURI** parameter in the command.

The default value is the value of the `$PSSessionApplicationName` preference variable on the local
computer. If this preference variable isn't defined, the default value is WSMAN. This value is
appropriate for most uses. For more information, see [about_Preference_Variables](./About/about_Preference_Variables.md).

The WinRM service uses the application name to select a listener to service the connection request.
The value of this parameter should match the value of the **URLPrefix** property of a listener on
the remote computer.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, FilePathComputerName
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: $PSSessionApplicationName if set on the local computer, otherwise WSMAN
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ArgumentList

Supplies the values of local variables in the command. The variables in the command are replaced by
these values before the command is run on the remote computer. Enter the values in a comma-separated
list. Values are associated with variables in the order that they're listed. The alias for
**ArgumentList** is Args.

The values in the **ArgumentList** parameter can be actual values, such as 1024, or they can be
references to local variables, such as `$max`.

To use local variables in a command, use the following command format:

`{param($<name1>[, $<name2>]...) <command-with-local-variables>} -ArgumentList <value>`
-or- `<local-variable>`

The **param** keyword lists the local variables that are used in the command. **ArgumentList**
supplies the values of the variables, in the order that they're listed. For more information about
the behavior of **ArgumentList**, see [about_Splatting](about/about_Splatting.md#splatting-with-arrays).

```yaml
Type: Object[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: Args

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AsJob

Indicates that this cmdlet runs the command as a background job on a remote computer. Use this
parameter to run commands that take an extensive time to finish.

When you use the **AsJob** parameter, the command returns an object that represents the job, and
then displays the command prompt. You can continue to work in the session while the job finishes. To
manage the job, use the `*-Job` cmdlets. To get the job results, use the `Receive-Job` cmdlet.

The **AsJob** parameter resembles using the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet to run a `Start-Job` cmdlet
remotely. However, with **AsJob**, the job is created on the local computer, even though the job
runs on a remote computer. The results of the remote job are automatically returned to the local
computer.

For more information about PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](About/about_Jobs.md) and [about_Remote_Jobs](About/about_Remote_Jobs.md).

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: FilePathRunspace, Session, ComputerName, FilePathComputerName, Uri, FilePathUri, VMId, VMName, FilePathVMId, FilePathVMName, SSHHost, ContainerId, FilePathContainerId, SSHHostHashParam, FilePathSSHHost, FilePathSSHHostHash
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Authentication

Specifies the mechanism that's used to authenticate the user's credentials. CredSSP authentication
is available only in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and later versions of the Windows operating
system.

The acceptable values for this parameter are as follows:

- Default
- Basic
- Credssp
- Digest
- Kerberos
- Negotiate
- NegotiateWithImplicitCredential

The default value is Default.

For more information about the values of this parameter, see
[AuthenticationMechanism Enumeration](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.runspaces.authenticationmechanism).

> [!CAUTION]
> Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) authentication, in which the user's credentials are
> passed to a remote computer to be authenticated, is designed for commands that require
> authentication on more than one resource, such as accessing a remote network share. This mechanism
> increases the security risk of the remote operation. If the remote computer is compromised, the
> credentials that are passed to it can be used to control the network session. For more
> information, see
> [Credential Security Support Provider](/windows/win32/secauthn/credential-security-support-provider).

```yaml
Type: AuthenticationMechanism
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, FilePathComputerName, Uri, FilePathUri
Aliases:
Accepted values: Basic, Default, Credssp, Digest, Kerberos, Negotiate, NegotiateWithImplicitCredential

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Default
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CertificateThumbprint

Specifies the digital public key certificate (X509) of a user account that has permission to connect
to the disconnected session. Enter the certificate thumbprint of the certificate.

Certificates are used in client certificate-based authentication. They can be mapped only to local
user accounts and they don't work with domain accounts.

To get a certificate thumbprint, use a `Get-Item` or `Get-ChildItem` command in the PowerShell Cert:
drive.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, Uri
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ComputerName

Specifies the computers on which the command runs. The default is the local computer.

When you use the **ComputerName** parameter, PowerShell creates a temporary connection that's used
only to run the specified command and is then closed. If you need a persistent connection, use the
**Session** parameter.

Type the NETBIOS name, IP address, or fully qualified domain name of one or more computers in a
comma-separated list. To specify the local computer, type the computer name, localhost, or a dot
(`.`).

To use an IP address in the value of **ComputerName**, the command must include the **Credential**
parameter. The computer must be configured for the HTTPS transport or the IP address of the remote
computer must be included in the local computer's WinRM **TrustedHosts** list. For instructions to
add a computer name to the **TrustedHosts** list, see [How to Add a Computer to the Trusted Host
List](./about/about_remote_troubleshooting.md#how-to-add-a-computer-to-the-trusted-hosts-list).

On Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system, to include the local computer
in the value of **ComputerName**, you must run PowerShell using the **Run as administrator** option.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, FilePathComputerName
Aliases: Cn

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: Local computer
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ConfigurationName

Specifies the session configuration that is used for the new **PSSession**.

Enter a configuration name or the fully qualified resource URI for a session configuration. If you
specify only the configuration name, the following schema URI is prepended:
`https://schemas.microsoft.com/PowerShell`.

When used with SSH, this parameter specifies the subsystem to use on the target as defined in
`sshd_config`. The default value for SSH is the `powershell` subsystem.

The session configuration for a session is located on the remote computer. If the specified session
configuration doesn't exist on the remote computer, the command fails.

The default value is the value of the `$PSSessionConfigurationName` preference variable on the local
computer. If this preference variable isn't set, the default is **Microsoft.PowerShell**. For more
information, see [about_Preference_Variables](about/about_Preference_Variables.md).

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, FilePathComputerName, Uri, FilePathUri, VMId, VMName, FilePathVMId, FilePathVMName, ContainerId, FilePathContainerId
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: $PSSessionConfigurationName if set on the local computer, otherwise Microsoft.PowerShell
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ConnectionUri

Specifies a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that defines the connection endpoint of the session.
The URI must be fully qualified.

The format of this string is as follows:

`<Transport>://<ComputerName>:<Port>/<ApplicationName>`

The default value is as follows:

`http://localhost:5985/WSMAN`

If you don't specify a connection URI, you can use the **UseSSL** and **Port** parameters to specify
the connection URI values.

Valid values for the **Transport** segment of the URI are HTTP and HTTPS. If you specify a
connection URI with a Transport segment, but don't specify a port, the session is created with the
standards ports: 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. To use the default ports for PowerShell remoting,
specify port 5985 for HTTP or 5986 for HTTPS.

If the destination computer redirects the connection to a different URI, PowerShell prevents the
redirection unless you use the **AllowRedirection** parameter in the command.

```yaml
Type: Uri[]
Parameter Sets: Uri, FilePathUri
Aliases: URI, CU

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: http://localhost:5985/WSMAN
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ContainerId

Specifies an array of container IDs.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: ContainerId, FilePathContainerId
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential

Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action. The default is the current
user.

Type a user name, such as **User01** or **Domain01\User01**, or enter a **PSCredential** object
generated by the `Get-Credential` cmdlet. If you type a user name, you're prompted to enter the
password.

Credentials are stored in a [PSCredential](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential)
object and the password is stored as a [SecureString](/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring).

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about **SecureString** data protection, see
> [How secure is SecureString?](/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring#how-secure-is-securestring).

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, FilePathComputerName, Uri, FilePathUri, VMId, VMName, FilePathVMId, FilePathVMName
Aliases:

Required: True (VMId, VMName, FilePathVMId, FilePathVMName), False (ComputerName, FilePathComputerName, Uri, FilePathUri)
Position: Named
Default value: Current user
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EnableNetworkAccess

Indicates that this cmdlet adds an interactive security token to loopback sessions. The interactive
token lets you run commands in the loopback session that get data from other computers. For example,
you can run a command in the session that copies XML files from a remote computer to the local
computer.

A loopback session is a **PSSession** that originates and ends on the same computer. To create a
loopback session, omit the **ComputerName** parameter or set its value to dot (`.`), localhost, or
the name of the local computer.

By default, loopback sessions are created using a network token, which might not provide sufficient
permission to authenticate to remote computers.

The **EnableNetworkAccess** parameter is effective only in loopback sessions. If you use
**EnableNetworkAccess** when you create a session on a remote computer, the command succeeds, but
the parameter is ignored.

You can allow remote access in a loopback session using the **CredSSP** value of the
**Authentication** parameter, which delegates the session credentials to other computers.

To protect the computer from malicious access, disconnected loopback sessions that have interactive
tokens, which are those created using **EnableNetworkAccess**, can be reconnected only from the
computer on which the session was created. Disconnected sessions that use CredSSP authentication can
be reconnected from other computers. For more information, see `Disconnect-PSSession`.

This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, FilePathComputerName, Uri, FilePathUri
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -FilePath

Specifies a local script that this cmdlet runs on one or more remote computers. Enter the path and
filename of the script, or pipe a script path to `Invoke-Command`. The script must exist on the
local computer or in a directory that the local computer can access. Use **ArgumentList** to specify
the values of parameters in the script.

When you use this parameter, PowerShell converts the contents of the specified script file to a
script block, transmits the script block to the remote computer, and runs it on the remote computer.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: FilePathRunspace, FilePathComputerName, FilePathUri, FilePathVMId, FilePathVMName, FilePathContainerId, FilePathSSHHost, FilePathSSHHostHash
Aliases: PSPath

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -HideComputerName

Indicates that this cmdlet omits the computer name of each object from the output display. By
default, the name of the computer that generated the object appears in the display.

This parameter affects only the output display. It doesn't change the object.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: FilePathRunspace, Session, ComputerName, FilePathComputerName, Uri, FilePathUri, VMId, VMName, FilePathVMId, FilePathVMName, SSHHost, ContainerId, FilePathContainerId, SSHHostHashParam, FilePathSSHHost, FilePathSSHHostHash
Aliases: HCN

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -HostName

Specifies an array of computer names for a Secure Shell (SSH) based connection. This is similar to
the **ComputerName** parameter except that the connection to the remote computer is made using SSH
rather than Windows WinRM.

This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 6.0.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: SSHHost, FilePathSSHHost
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InDisconnectedSession

Indicates that this cmdlet runs a command or script in a disconnected session.

When you use the **InDisconnectedSession** parameter, `Invoke-Command` creates a persistent session
on each remote computer, starts the command specified by the **ScriptBlock** or **FilePath**
parameter, and then disconnects from the session. The commands continue to run in the disconnected
sessions. **InDisconnectedSession** enables you to run commands without maintaining a connection to
the remote sessions. And, because the session is disconnected before any results are returned,
**InDisconnectedSession** makes sure that all command results are returned to the reconnected
session, instead of being split between sessions.

You can't use **InDisconnectedSession** with the **Session** parameter or the **AsJob** parameter.

Commands that use **InDisconnectedSession** return a **PSSession** object that represents the
disconnected session. They don't return the command output. To connect to the disconnected session,
use the `Connect-PSSession` or `Receive-PSSession` cmdlets. To get the results of commands that ran
in the session, use the `Receive-PSSession` cmdlet. To run commands that generate output in a
disconnected session, set the value of the **OutputBufferingMode** session option to **Drop**. If
you intend to connect to the disconnected session, set the idle time-out in the session so that it
provides sufficient time for you to connect before deleting the session.

You can set the output buffering mode and idle time-out in the **SessionOption** parameter or in the
`$PSSessionOption` preference variable. For more information about session options, see
`New-PSSessionOption` and [about_Preference_Variables](./about/about_preference_variables.md).

For more information about the Disconnected Sessions feature, see [about_Remote_Disconnected_Sessions](about/about_Remote_Disconnected_Sessions.md).

This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, FilePathComputerName, Uri, FilePathUri
Aliases: Disconnected

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InputObject

Specifies input to the command. Enter a variable that contains the objects or type a command or
expression that gets the objects.

When using the **InputObject** parameter, use the `$Input` automatic variable in the value of the
**ScriptBlock** parameter to represent the input objects.

```yaml
Type: PSObject
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -JobName

Specifies a friendly name for the background job. By default, jobs are named `Job<n>`, where `<n>`
is an ordinal number.

If you use the **JobName** parameter in a command, the command is run as a job, and `Invoke-Command`
returns a job object, even if you don't include **AsJob** in the command.

For more information about PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](./About/about_Jobs.md).

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: FilePathRunspace, Session, ComputerName, FilePathComputerName, Uri, FilePathUri, ContainerId, FilePathContainerId
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Job<n>
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -KeyFilePath

Specifies a key file path used by Secure Shell (SSH) to authenticate a user on a remote computer.

SSH allows user authentication to be performed via private and public keys as an alternative to
basic password authentication. If the remote computer is configured for key authentication, then
this parameter can be used to provide the key that identifies the user.

This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 6.0.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: SSHHost, FilePathSSHHost
Aliases: IdentityFilePath

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NoNewScope

Indicates that this cmdlet runs the specified command in the current scope. By default,
`Invoke-Command` runs commands in their own scope.

This parameter is valid only in commands that are run in the current session, that is, commands that
omit both the **ComputerName** and **Session** parameters.

This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: InProcess
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Port

Specifies the network port on the remote computer that is used for this command. To connect to a
remote computer, the remote computer must be listening on the port that the connection uses. The
default ports are 5985 (WinRM port for HTTP) and 5986 (WinRM port for HTTPS).

Before using an alternate port, configure the WinRM listener on the remote computer to listen at
that port. To configure the listener, type the following two commands at the PowerShell prompt:

`Remove-Item -Path WSMan:\Localhost\listener\listener* -Recurse`

`New-Item -Path WSMan:\Localhost\listener -Transport http -Address * -Port \<port-number\>`

Don't use the **Port** parameter unless you must. The port that is set in the command applies to all
computers or sessions on which the command runs. An alternate port setting might prevent the command
from running on all computers.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, FilePathComputerName, SSHHost
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RemoteDebug

Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: FilePathRunspace, Session, ComputerName, FilePathComputerName, Uri, FilePathUri, VMId, VMName, FilePathVMId, FilePathVMName, SSHHost, ContainerId, FilePathContainerId, SSHHostHashParam, FilePathSSHHost, FilePathSSHHostHash
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RunAsAdministrator

Indicates that this cmdlet invokes a command as an Administrator.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: ContainerId, FilePathContainerId
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ScriptBlock

Specifies the commands to run. Enclose the commands in curly braces `{ }` to create a script block.
This parameter is required.

By default, any variables in the command are evaluated on the remote computer. To include local
variables in the command, use **ArgumentList**.

```yaml
Type: ScriptBlock
Parameter Sets: InProcess, Session, ComputerName, Uri, VMId, VMName, SSHHost, ContainerId, SSHHostHashParam
Aliases: Command

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Session

Specifies an array of sessions in which this cmdlet runs the command. Enter a variable that contains
**PSSession** objects or a command that creates or gets the **PSSession** objects, such as a
`New-PSSession` or `Get-PSSession` command.

When you create a **PSSession**, PowerShell establishes a persistent connection to the remote
computer. Use a **PSSession** to run a series of related commands that share data. To run a single
command or a series of unrelated commands, use the **ComputerName** parameter. For more information,
see [about_PSSessions](./About/about_PSSessions.md).

```yaml
Type: PSSession[]
Parameter Sets: FilePathRunspace, Session
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SessionName

Specifies a friendly name for a disconnected session. You can use the name to refer to the session
in subsequent commands, such as a `Get-PSSession` command. This parameter is valid only with the
**InDisconnectedSession** parameter.

This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, FilePathComputerName
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SessionOption

Specifies advanced options for the session. Enter a **SessionOption** object, such as one that you
create using the `New-PSSessionOption` cmdlet, or a hash table in which the keys are session option
names and the values are session option values.

The default values for the options are determined by the value of the `$PSSessionOption` preference
variable, if it's set. Otherwise, the default values are established by options set in the session
configuration.

The session option values take precedence over default values for sessions set in the
`$PSSessionOption` preference variable and in the session configuration. However, they don't take
precedence over maximum values, quotas, or limits set in the session configuration.

For a description of the session options that includes the default values, see
`New-PSSessionOption`. For information about the `$PSSessionOption` preference variable, see [about_Preference_Variables](About/about_Preference_Variables.md).
For more information about session configurations, see [about_Session_Configurations](About/about_Session_Configurations.md).

```yaml
Type: PSSessionOption
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, FilePathComputerName, Uri, FilePathUri
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SSHConnection

This parameter takes an array of hash tables where each hash table contains one or more connection
parameters needed to establish a Secure Shell (SSH) connection. The **SSHConnection** parameter is
useful for creating multiple sessions where each session requires different connection information.

The hashtable has the following members:

- **ComputerName** (or **HostName**)
- **Port**
- **UserName**
- **KeyFilePath** (or **IdentityFilePath**)

**ComputerName** (or **HostName**) is the only key-value pair that is required.

This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 6.0.

```yaml
Type: Hashtable[]
Parameter Sets: SSHHostHashParam, FilePathSSHHostHash
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SSHTransport

Indicates that the remote connection is established using Secure Shell (SSH).

By default PowerShell uses Windows WinRM to connect to a remote computer. This switch forces
PowerShell to use the **HostName** parameter for establishing an SSH based remote connection.

This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 6.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: SSHHost, FilePathSSHHost
Aliases:
Accepted values: true

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ThrottleLimit

Specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections that can be established to run this command.
If you omit this parameter or enter a value of 0, the default value, 32, is used.

The throttle limit applies only to the current command, not to the session or to the computer.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: FilePathRunspace, Session, ComputerName, FilePathComputerName, Uri, FilePathUri, VMId, VMName, FilePathVMId, FilePathVMName, ContainerId, FilePathContainerId
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 32
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UserName

Specifies the username for the account used to run a command on the remote computer. The user
authentication method depends on how Secure Shell (SSH) is configured on the remote computer.

If SSH is configured for basic password authentication, then you'll be prompted for the user
password.

If SSH is configured for key-based user authentication then a key file path can be provided via the
**KeyFilePath** parameter and no password prompt occurs. If the client user key file is located in
an SSH known location, then the **KeyFilePath** parameter isn't needed for key-based authentication,
and user authentication occurs automatically based on the username. For more information, see your
platform's SSH documentation about key-based user authentication.

This isn't a required parameter. If the **UserName** parameter isn't specified, then the current
logged on username is used for the connection.

This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 6.0.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: SSHHost, FilePathSSHHost
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UseSSL

Indicates that this cmdlet uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to establish a connection to
the remote computer. By default, SSL isn't used.

WS-Management encrypts all PowerShell content transmitted over the network. The **UseSSL** parameter
is an additional protection that sends the data across an HTTPS, instead of HTTP.

If you use this parameter, but SSL isn't available on the port that's used for the command, the
command fails.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, FilePathComputerName
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -VMId

Specifies an array of IDs of virtual machines.

```yaml
Type: Guid[]
Parameter Sets: VMId, FilePathVMId
Aliases: VMGuid

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -VMName

Specifies an array of names of virtual machines.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: VMName, FilePathVMName
Aliases:

Required: True

### -Subsystem

Specifies the SSH subsystem used for the new **PSSession**.

This specifies the subsystem to use on the target as defined in sshd_config.
The subsystem starts a specific version of PowerShell with predefined parameters.
If the specified subsystem does not exist on the remote computer, the command fails.

If this parameter is not used, the default is the 'powershell' subsystem.

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable,
-InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose,
-WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock

You can pipe a command in a script block to `Invoke-Command`. Use the `$Input` automatic variable to
represent the input objects in the command.

## OUTPUTS

### System.Management.Automation.PSRemotingJob, System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.PSSession, or the output of the invoked command

This cmdlet returns a job object, if you use the **AsJob** parameter. If you specify the
**InDisconnectedSession** parameter, `Invoke-Command` returns a **PSSession** object. Otherwise, it
returns the output of the invoked command, which is the value of the **ScriptBlock** parameter.

## NOTES

On Windows Vista, and later versions of the Windows operating system, to use the **ComputerName**
parameter of `Invoke-Command` to run a command on the local computer, you must run PowerShell using
the **Run as administrator** option.

When you run commands on multiple computers, PowerShell connects to the computers in the order in
which they appear in the list. However, the command output is displayed in the order that it's
received from the remote computers, which might be different.

Errors that result from the command that `Invoke-Command` runs are included in the command results.
Errors that would be terminating errors in a local command are treated as non-terminating errors in
a remote command. This strategy makes sure that terminating errors on one computer don't close the
command on all computers on which it's run. This practice is used even when a remote command is run
on a single computer.

If the remote computer isn't in a domain that the local computer trusts, the computer might not be
able to authenticate the user's credentials. To add the remote computer to the list of trusted hosts
in WS-Management, use the following command in the `WSMAN` provider, where `<Remote-Computer-Name>`
is the name of the remote computer:

`Set-Item -Path WSMan:\Localhost\Client\TrustedHosts -Value \<Remote-Computer-Name\>`

When you disconnect a **PSSession** using the **InDisconnectedSession** parameter, the session
state is **Disconnected** and the availability is **None**. The value of the **State** property is
relative to the current session. A value of **Disconnected** means that the **PSSession** isn't
connected to the current session. However, it doesn't mean that the **PSSession** is disconnected
from all sessions. It might be connected to a different session. To determine whether you can
connect or reconnect to the session, use the **Availability** property.

An **Availability** value of **None** indicates that you can connect to the session. A value of
**Busy** indicates that you can't connect to the **PSSession** because it's connected to another
session. For more information about the values of the **State** property of sessions, see
[RunspaceState](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.runspaces.runspacestate). For more
information about the values of the **Availability** property of sessions, see
[RunspaceAvailability](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.runspaces.runspaceavailability).

The **HostName** and **SSHConnection** parameters were included starting with PowerShell 6.0. They
were added to provide PowerShell remoting based on Secure Shell (SSH). PowerShell and SSH are
supported on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and PowerShell remoting works over these
platforms where PowerShell and SSH are installed and configured. This is separate from the previous
Windows only remoting that is based on WinRM and many of the WinRM specific features and limitations
don't apply. For example WinRM based quotas, session options, custom endpoint configuration, and
disconnect/reconnect features are currently not supported. For more information about how to set up
PowerShell SSH remoting, see
[PowerShell Remoting Over SSH](/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/ssh-remoting-in-powershell-core).
