summary: |-
  Gets the content of the item at the specified location.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
notes: |-
  The `Get-Content` cmdlet is designed to work with the data exposed by any provider. To get the
  providers in your session, use the `Get-PSProvider` cmdlet. For more information, see
  [about_Providers](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Providers.md).
inputs:
- name: <xref href="System.Int64, System.String[], System.Management.Automation.PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Get the content of a text file'
  code: |-
    1..100 | ForEach-Object { Add-Content -Path .\LineNumbers.txt -Value "This is line $_." }
    Get-Content -Path .\LineNumbers.txt

    This is Line 1
    This is Line 2
    ...
    This is line 99.
    This is line 100.
  description: |-
    The array values 1-100 are sent down the pipeline to the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet. `ForEach-Object`
    uses a script block with the `Add-Content` cmdlet to create the `LineNumbers.txt` file. The variable
    `$_` represents the array values as each object is sent down the pipeline. The `Get-Content` cmdlet
    uses the **Path** parameter to specify the `LineNumbers.txt` file and displays the content in the
    PowerShell console.
  summary: |+
    This example gets the content of a file in the current directory. The `LineNumbers.txt` file
    contains 100 lines in the format, **This is Line X** and is used in several examples.

- title: 'Example 2: Limit the number of lines Get-Content returns'
  code: |-
    Get-Content -Path .\LineNumbers.txt -TotalCount 5

    This is Line 1
    This is Line 2
    This is Line 3
    This is Line 4
    This is Line 5
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This command gets the first five lines of a file. The **TotalCount** parameter is used to gets the
    first five lines of content. This example uses the `LineNumbers.txt` file that was created in
    Example 1.

- title: 'Example 3: Get a specific line of content from a text file'
  code: |-
    (Get-Content -Path .\LineNumbers.txt -TotalCount 25)[-1]

    This is Line 25
  description: |-
    The `Get-Content` command is wrapped in parentheses so that the command completes before going to
    the next step. `Get-Content`returns an array of lines, this allows you to add the index notation after
    the parenthesis to retrieve a specific line number. In this case, the `[-1]` index specifies the
    last index in the returned array of 25 retrieved lines.
  summary: |+
    This command gets a specific number of lines from a file and then displays only the last line of
    that content. The **TotalCount** parameter gets the first 25 lines of content. This example uses the
    `LineNumbers.txt` file that was created in Example 1.

- title: 'Example 4: Get the last line of a text file'
  code: |-
    Get-Item -Path .\LineNumbers.txt | Get-Content -Tail 1

    This is Line 100
  description: |-
    This example uses the `Get-Item` cmdlet to demonstrate that you can pipe files into the
    `Get-Content` parameter. The **Tail** parameter gets the last line of the file. This method is
    faster than retrieving all of the lines and using the `[-1]` index notation.
  summary: |+
    This command gets the first line and last line of content from a file. This example uses the
    `LineNumbers.txt` file that was created in Example 1.

- title: 'Example 5: Get the content of an alternate data stream'
  code: |-
    Set-Content -Path .\Stream.txt -Value 'This is the content of the Stream.txt file'
    # Specify a wildcard to the Stream parameter to display all streams of the recently created file.
    Get-Item -Path .\Stream.txt -Stream *

    PSPath        : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\Test\Stream.txt::$DATA
    PSParentPath  : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\Test

    PSDrive       : C
    PSProvider    : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem
    PSIsContainer : False
    FileName      : C:\Test\Stream.txt
    Stream        : :$DATA
    Length        : 44

    # Retrieve the content of the primary, or $DATA stream.
    Get-Content -Path .\Stream.txt -Stream $DATA

    This is the content of the Stream.txt file

    # Use the Stream parameter of Add-Content to create a new Stream containing sample content.
    Add-Content -Path .\Stream.txt -Stream NewStream -Value 'Added a stream named NewStream to Stream.txt'
    # Use Get-Item to verify the stream was created.
    Get-Item -Path .\Stream.txt -Stream *

    PSPath        : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\Test\Stream.txt::$DATA
    PSParentPath  : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\Test
    PSChildName   : Stream.txt::$DATA
    PSDrive       : C
    PSProvider    : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem
    PSIsContainer : False
    FileName      : C:\Test\Stream.txt
    Stream        : :$DATA
    Length        : 44

    PSPath        : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\Test\Stream.txt:NewStream
    PSParentPath  : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\Test

    FileName      : C:\Test\Stream.txt
    Stream        : NewStream
    Length        : 46

    # Retrieve the content of your newly created Stream.
    Get-Content -Path .\Stream.txt -Stream NewStream

    Added a stream named NewStream to Stream.txt
  description: |-
    The **Stream** parameter is a dynamic parameter of the [FileSystem provider](../microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_filesystem_provider.md#stream-systemstring).
    By default `Get-Content` only retrieves data from the default, or `:$DATA` stream. **Streams** can
    be used to store hidden data such as attributes, security settings, or other data. They can also be
    stored on directories without being child items.
  summary: |+
    This example describes how to use the **Stream** parameter to get the content of an alternate data
    stream for files stored on a Windows NTFS volume. In this example, the `Set-Content` cmdlet is used
    to create sample content in a file named `Stream.txt`.

- title: 'Example 6: Get raw content'
  code: |-
    $raw = Get-Content -Path .\LineNumbers.txt -Raw
    $lines = Get-Content -Path .\LineNumbers.txt
    Write-Host "Raw contains $($raw.Count) lines."
    Write-Host "Lines contains $($lines.Count) lines."

    Raw contains 1 lines.
    Lines contains 100 lines.
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    The commands in this example get the contents of a file as one string, instead of an array of
    strings. By default, without the **Raw** dynamic parameter, content is returned as an array of
    newline-delimited strings. This example uses the `LineNumbers.txt` file that was created in Example
    1.

- title: 'Example 7: Use Filters with Get-Content'
  code: |-
    Get-Content -Path C:\Temp\* -Filter *.log
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    You can specify a filter to the `Get-Content` cmdlet. When using filters to qualify the **Path**
    parameter, you need to include a trailing asterisk (`*`) to indicate the contents of the
    path.

    The following command gets the content of all `*.log` files in the `C:\Temp` directory.

- title: 'Example 8: Get file contents as a byte array'
  code: |-
    $byteArray = Get-Content -Path C:\temp\test.txt -AsByteStream -Raw
    Get-Member -InputObject $bytearray

    TypeName: System.Byte[]

    Name           MemberType            Definition
    ----           ----------            ----------
    Count          AliasProperty         Count = Length
    Add            Method                int IList.Add(System.Object value)
  description: |-
    The first command uses the **AsByteStream** parameter to get the stream of bytes from the file.
    The **Raw** parameter ensures that the bytes are returned as a `[System.Byte[]]`. If the **Raw**
    parameter was absent, the return value is a stream of bytes, which is interpreted by
    PowerShell as `[System.Object[]]`.
  summary: |+
    This example demonstrates how to get the contents of a file as a `[byte[]]` as a single object.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsByteStream
  description: |+
    Specifies that the content should be read as a stream of bytes. The **AsByteStream** parameter was
    introduced in Windows PowerShell 6.0.

    A warning occurs when you use the **AsByteStream** parameter with the **Encoding** parameter. The
    **AsByteStream** parameter ignores any encoding and the output is returned as a stream of bytes.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with PowerShell.
    > To impersonate another user, or elevate your credentials when running this cmdlet,

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Delimiter
  description: |+
    Specifies the delimiter that `Get-Content` uses to divide the file into objects while it reads. The
    default is `\n`, the end-of-line character. When reading a text file, `Get-Content` returns a
    collection of string objects, each of which ends with an end-of-line character. When you enter a
    delimiter that does not exist in the file, `Get-Content` returns the entire file as a single,
    undelimited object.

    You can use this parameter to split a large file into smaller files by specifying a file separator,
    as the delimiter. The delimiter is preserved (not discarded) and becomes the last item in each file
    section.

    **Delimiter** is a dynamic parameter that the **FileSystem** provider adds to the `Get-Content`
    cmdlet. This parameter works only in file system drives.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Currently, when the value of the **Delimiter** parameter is an empty string, `Get-Content` does
    > not return anything. This is a known issue. To force `Get-Content` to return the entire file as
    > a single, undelimited string. Enter a value that does not exist in the file.

  defaultValue: End-of-line character
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Text.Encoding" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Encoding
  description: |+
    Specifies the type of encoding for the target file. The default value is `utf8NoBOM`.

    The acceptable values for this parameter are as follows:

    - `ascii`: Uses the encoding for the ASCII (7-bit) character set.
    - `bigendianunicode`: Encodes in UTF-16 format using the big-endian byte order.
    - `bigendianutf32`: Encodes in UTF-32 format using the big-endian byte order.
    - `oem`: Uses the default encoding for MS-DOS and console programs.
    - `unicode`: Encodes in UTF-16 format using the little-endian byte order.
    - `utf7`: Encodes in UTF-7 format.
    - `utf8`: Encodes in UTF-8 format.
    - `utf8BOM`: Encodes in UTF-8 format with Byte Order Mark (BOM)
    - `utf8NoBOM`: Encodes in UTF-8 format without Byte Order Mark (BOM)
    - `utf32`: Encodes in UTF-32 format.

    Encoding is a dynamic parameter that the **FileSystem** provider adds to the `Get-Content` cmdlet.
    This parameter is available only in file system drives.

    When reading from and writing to binary files, use the **AsByteStream** parameter and a value of 0
    for the **ReadCount** parameter. A **ReadCount** value of 0 reads the entire file in a single read
    operation. The default **ReadCount** value, 1, reads one byte in each read operation and converts
    each byte into a separate object, which causes errors when you use the `Set-Content` cmdlet to write
    the bytes to a file unless you use **AsByteStream** parameter.

    Beginning with PowerShell 6.2, the **Encoding** parameter also allows numeric IDs of registered code
    pages (like `-Encoding 1251`) or string names of registered code pages (like
    `-Encoding "windows-1251"`). For more information, see the .NET documentation for
    [Encoding.CodePage](/dotnet/api/system.text.encoding.codepage?view=netcore-2.2).

    > [!NOTE]
    > **UTF-7*** is no longer recommended to use. In PowerShell 7.1, a warning is written if you
    > specify `utf7` for the **Encoding** parameter.

  name: Exclude
  description: |+
    Specifies, as a string array, an item or items that this cmdlet excludes in the operation.
    The value of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter.

    Enter a path element or pattern, such as `*.txt`.
    Wildcard characters are permitted.

    The **Exclude** parameter is effective only when the command includes the contents of an item,
    such as `C:\Windows\*`, where the wildcard character specifies the contents of the `C:\Windows`
    directory.

- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Specifies a filter to qualify the **Path** parameter. The [FileSystem](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_FileSystem_Provider.md)
    provider is the only installed PowerShell provider that supports the use of filters. You can find
    the syntax for the **FileSystem** filter language in [about_Wildcards](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Wildcards.md).
    Filters are more efficient than other parameters, because the provider applies them when the cmdlet
    gets the objects rather than having PowerShell filter the objects after they are retrieved.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    **Force** will override a read-only attribute or create directories to complete a file path. The
    **Force** parameter does not attempt to change file permissions or override security restrictions.

  name: Include
  description: |+
    Specifies, as a string array, an item or items that this cmdlet includes in the operation. The value
    of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter. Enter a path element or pattern, such as
    `"*.txt"`. Wildcard characters are permitted. The **Include** parameter is effective only when the
    command includes the contents of an item, such as `C:\Windows\*`, where the wildcard character
    specifies the contents of the `C:\Windows` directory.

- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: LiteralPath
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies a path to one or more locations. The value of **LiteralPath** is used exactly as it is
    typed. No characters are interpreted as wildcards. If the path includes escape characters, enclose
    it in single quotation marks. Single quotation marks tell PowerShell not to interpret any characters
    as escape sequences.

  name: Path
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the path to an item where `Get-Content` gets the content. Wildcard characters are
    permitted. The paths must be paths to items, not to containers. For example, you must specify a path
    to one or more files, not a path to a directory.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Raw
  description: |+
    Ignores newline characters and returns the entire contents of a file in one string with the newlines
    preserved. By default, newline characters in a file are used as delimiters to separate the input
    into an array of strings. This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 3.0.

    **Raw** is a dynamic parameter that the **FileSystem** provider adds to the `Get-Content` cmdlet
    This parameter works only in file system drives.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Int64" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ReadCount
  description: |+
    Specifies how many lines of content are sent through the pipeline at a time. The default value is 1.
    A value of 0 (zero) sends all of the content at one time.

    This parameter does not change the content displayed, but it does affect the time it takes to
    display the content. As the value of **ReadCount** increases, the time it takes to return the first
    line increases, but the total time for the operation decreases. This can make a perceptible
    difference in large items.

  defaultValue: "1"

    > This Parameter is only available on Windows.

    Gets the contents of the specified alternate NTFS file stream from the file. Enter the stream name.
    Wildcards are not supported.

    **Stream** is a dynamic parameter that the **FileSystem** provider adds to the `Get-Content` cmdlet.
    This parameter works only in file system drives on Windows systems. This parameter was introduced in
    Windows PowerShell 3.0.

- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Wait
  description: |+
    Keeps the file open after all existing lines have been output. While waiting, `Get-Content` checks
    the file once each second and outputs new lines if present. You can interrupt **Wait** by pressing
    **CTRL+C**. Waiting also ends if the file gets deleted, in which case a non-terminating error is
    reported.

    **Wait** is a dynamic parameter that the FileSystem provider adds to the `Get-Content` cmdlet. This
    parameter works only in file system drives. **Wait** cannot be combined with **Raw**.

  defaultValue: "False"

uid: Microsoft.PowerShell.Management.Get-Content
name: Get-Content
description: |-
  The `Get-Content` cmdlet gets the content of the item at the location specified by the path, such as
  the text in a file or the content of a function. For files, the content is read one line at a time
  and returns a collection of objects, each of which represents a line of content.

  Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, `Get-Content` can also get a specified number of lines from the
  beginning or end of an item.
