### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Starts one or more stopped services.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
notes: |-
  This cmdlet is only available on Windows platforms.

  - You can also refer to `Start-Service` by its built-in alias, `sasv`. For more information, see
    [about_Aliases](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Aliases.md).
  - `Start-Service` can control services only if the current user has permission to do this. If a
    command does not work correctly, you might not have the required permissions.
  - To find the service names and display names of the services on your system, type `Get-Service`.
    The service names appear in the **Name** column, and the display names appear in the
    **DisplayName** column.
  - You can start only the services that have a start type of Manual, Automatic, or Automatic (Delayed
    Start). You cannot start the services that have a start type of Disabled. If a `Start-Service`
    command fails with the message `Cannot start service \<service-name\> on computer`, use
    `Get-CimInstance` to find the start type of the service and, if you have to, use the `Set-Service`
    cmdlet to change the start type of the service.
  - Some services, such as Performance Logs and Alerts (SysmonLog) stop automatically if they have no
    work to do. When PowerShell starts a service that stops itself almost immediately, it displays the
    following message: `Service \<display-name\> start failed.`
inputs:
- name: <xref href="System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController, System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    You can pipe objects that represent the services or strings that contain the service names to this
    cmdlet.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="None, System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    This cmdlet generates a **System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController** object that represents the
    service, if you specify **PassThru**. Otherwise, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Start a service by using its name'
  code: |-
    Start-Service -Name "eventlog"
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example starts the EventLog service on the local computer. The **Name** parameter identifies
    the service by its service name.

- title: 'Example 2: Display information without starting a service'
  code: |-
    Start-Service -DisplayName *remote* -WhatIf
  description: |-
    The **DisplayName** parameter identifies the services by their display name instead of their service
    name. The **WhatIf** parameter causes the cmdlet to display what would happen when you run the
    command but does not make changes.
  summary: |+
    This example shows what would occur if you started the services that have a display name that
    includes "remote".

- title: 'Example 3: Start a service and record the action in a text file'
  code: |-
    $s = Get-Service wmi
    Start-Service -InputObject $s -PassThru | Format-List >> services.txt
  description: |-
    First we use `Get-Service` to get an object that represent the WMI service and store it in the `$s`
    variable. Next, we start the service. Without the **PassThru** parameter, `Start-Service` does not
    create any output. The pipeline operator (|) passes the object output by `Start-Service` to the
    `Format-List` cmdlet to format the object as a list of its properties. The append redirection
    operator (\>\>) redirects the output to the services.txt file. The output is added to the end of the
    existing file.
  summary: |+
    This example starts the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service on the computer and adds a
    record of the action to the services.txt file.

- title: 'Example 4: Start a disabled service'
  code: |-
    PS> Start-Service tlntsvr
    Start-Service : Service 'Telnet (TlntSvr)' cannot be started due to the following error: Cannot start service TlntSvr on computer '.'.
    At line:1 char:14
    + Start-Service  <<<< tlntsvr

    PS> Get-CimInstance win32_service | Where-Object Name -eq "tlntsvr"
    ExitCode  : 0
    Name      : TlntSvr
    ProcessId : 0
    StartMode : Disabled
    State     : Stopped
    Status    : OK

    PS> Set-Service tlntsvr -StartupType manual
    PS> Start-Service tlntsvr
  description: |-
    The first attempt to start the Telnet service (tlntsvr) fails. The `Get-CimInstance` command shows
    that the **StartMode** property of the Tlntsvr service is **Disabled**. The `Set-Service` cmdlet
    changes the start type to **Manual**. Now, we can resubmit the `Start-Service` command. This time,
    the command succeeds. To verify that the command succeeded, run `Get-Service`.
  summary: |+
    This example shows how to start a service when the start type of the service is **Disabled**.

description: |-
  The `Start-Service` cmdlet sends a start message to the Windows Service Controller for each of the
  specified services. If a service is already running, the message is ignored without error. You can
  specify the services by their service names or display names, or you can use the **InputObject**
  parameter to supply a service object that represents the services that you want to start.
