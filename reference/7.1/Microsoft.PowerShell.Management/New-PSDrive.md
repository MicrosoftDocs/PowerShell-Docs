## DESCRIPTION

The `New-PSDrive` cmdlet creates temporary and persistent drives that are mapped to or associated
with a location in a data store, such as a network drive, a directory on the local computer, or a
registry key, and persistent Windows mapped network drives that are associated with a file system
location on a remote computer.

Temporary drives exist only in the current PowerShell session and in sessions that you create in the
current session. They can have any name that is valid in PowerShell and can be mapped to any local
or remote resource. You can use temporary PowerShell drives to access data in the associated data
store, just as you would do with any mapped network drive. You can change locations into the drive,
by using `Set-Location`, and access the contents of the drive by using `Get-Item` or
`Get-ChildItem`.

Because temporary drives are known only to PowerShell, you can't access them by using File Explorer,
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), Component Object Model (COM), Microsoft .NET Framework, or
with tools such as **net use**.

The following features were added to `New-PSDrive` in PowerShell 3.0:

- Mapped network drives. You can use the **Persist** parameter of `New-PSDrive` to create Windows
  mapped network drives. Unlike temporary PowerShell drives, Windows mapped network drives aren't
  session-specific. They're saved in Windows and they can be managed by using standard Windows
  tools, such as File Explorer and **net use**. Mapped network drives must have a drive-letter name
  and be connected to a remote file system location. When your command is scoped locally, no
  dot-sourcing, the **Persist** parameter doesn't persist the creation of a **PSDrive** beyond the
  scope in which the command is running. If you're running `New-PSDrive` inside a script, and you
  want the drive to persist indefinitely, you must dot-source the script. For best results, to force
  a new drive to persist indefinitely, add the **Scope** parameter to your command, and set its
  value to **Global**. For more information about dot-sourcing, see
  [about_Scripts](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Scripts.md#script-scope-and-dot-sourcing).
- External drives. When an external drive is connected to the computer, PowerShell automatically
  adds a **PSDrive** to the file system that represents the new drive. You don't have to restart
  PowerShell. Similarly, when an external drive is disconnected from the computer, PowerShell
  automatically deletes the **PSDrive** that represents the removed drive.
- Credentials for Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths.

When the value of the **Root** parameter is a UNC path, such as `\\Server\Share`, the credential
specified in the value of the **Credential** parameter is used to create the **PSDrive**. Otherwise,
**Credential** isn't effective when you're creating new file system drives.

Some code samples use splatting to reduce the line length and improve readability. For more
information, see [about_Splatting](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Splatting.md).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Create a temporary drive mapped to a network share

This example creates a temporary PowerShell drive that's mapped to a network share.

```powershell
New-PSDrive -Name "Public" -PSProvider "FileSystem" -Root "\\Server01\Public"
```

```Output
Name       Provider      Root
----       --------      ----
Public     FileSystem    \\Server01\Public
```

`New-PSDrive` uses the **Name** parameter to specify PowerShell drive named `Public` and the
**PSProvider** parameter to specify the PowerShell `FileSystem` provider. The **Root** parameter
specifies the network share's UNC path.

To view the contents from a PowerShell session: `Get-ChildItem -Path Public:`

### Example 2: Create a temporary drive mapped to a local directory

This example creates a temporary PowerShell drive that provides access to a directory on the local
computer.

```powershell
$parameters = @{
    Name = "MyDocs"
    PSProvider = "FileSystem"
    Root = "C:\Users\User01\Documents"
    Description = "Maps to my My Documents folder."
}
New-PSDrive @parameters
```

```Output
Name        Provider      Root
----        --------      ----
MyDocs      FileSystem    C:\Users\User01\Documents
```

Splatting creates the parameter keys and values. The **Name** parameter specifies the drive name,
**MyDocs**. The **PSProvider** parameter specifies the PowerShell `FileSystem` provider. **Root**
specifies the local computer's directory. The **Description** parameter describes the drive's
purpose. `New-PSDrive` uses the splatted parameters to create the `MyDocs` drive.

To view the contents from a PowerShell session: `Get-ChildItem -Path MyDocs:`

### Example 3: Create a temporary drive for a registry key

This example creates a temporary PowerShell drive that provides access to a registry key. It creates
a drive named MyCompany that is mapped to the `HKLM:\Software\MyCompany` registry key.

```powershell
New-PSDrive -Name "MyCompany" -PSProvider "Registry" -Root "HKLM:\Software\MyCompany"
```

```Output
Name           Provider      Root
----           --------      ----
MyCompany      Registry      HKLM:\Software\MyCompany
```

`New-PSDrive` uses the **Name** parameter to specify PowerShell drive named `MyCompany` and the
**PSProvider** parameter to specify the PowerShell `Registry` provider. The **Root** parameter
specifies the registry location.

To view the contents from a PowerShell session: `Get-ChildItem -Path MyCompany:`

### Example 4: Create a persistent mapped network drive using credentials

This example maps a network drive that's authenticated with a domain service account's credentials.
For more information about the **PSCredential** object that stores credentials and how passwords are
stored as a **SecureString**, see the **Credential** parameter's description.

```powershell
$cred = Get-Credential -Credential Contoso\ServiceAccount
New-PSDrive -Name "S" -Root "\\Server01\Scripts" -Persist -PSProvider "FileSystem" -Credential $cred
Net Use
```

```Output
Status       Local     Remote                    Network
---------------------------------------------------------
OK           S:        \\Server01\Scripts        Microsoft Windows Network
```

> [!NOTE]
> Remember, if you use the above snippet in a script, set the **Scope** parameter value to
> "Global" to ensure the drive persists outside the current scope.

The `$cred` variable stores a **PSCredential** object that contains the service account's
credentials. `Get-Credential` prompts you to enter the password that's stored in a **SecureString**.

`New-PSDrive` creates the mapped network drive by using several parameters. **Name** specifies the
`S` drive letter that Windows accepts. and **Root** defines `\\Server01\Scripts` as the location on
a remote computer. **Persist** creates a Windows mapped network drive that's saved on the local
computer. **PSProvider** specifies the `FileSystem` provider. **Credential** uses the `$cred`
variable to get the service account credentials for authentication.

The mapped drive can be viewed on the local computer in PowerShell sessions, File Explorer, and with
tools such as **net use**. To view the contents from a PowerShell session: `Get-ChildItem -Path S:`

### Example 5: Create persistent and temporary drives

This example shows the difference between a persistent mapped network drive and a temporary
PowerShell drive that is mapped to the same network share.

If you close the PowerShell session and then open a new session, the temporary `PSDrive:` isn't
available, but the persistent `X:` drive is available. When deciding which method to use to map
network drives, consider how you'll use the drive. For example, whether it has to be persistent, and
whether the drive has to be visible to other Windows features.

```powershell
# Create a temporary PowerShell drive called PSDrive:
# that's mapped to the \\Server01\Public network share.
New-PSDrive -Name "PSDrive" -PSProvider "FileSystem" -Root "\\Server01\Public"

# Use the Persist parameter of New-PSDrive to create the X: mapped network drive,
# which is also mapped to the \\Server01\Public network share.
New-PSDrive -Persist -Name "X" -PSProvider "FileSystem" -Root "\\Server01\Public"

# Now, you can use the Get-PSDrive drive cmdlet to examine the two drives.
# The drives appear to be the same, although the network share name appears only
# in the root of the PSDrive: drive.
Get-PSDrive -Name "PSDrive", "X"
```

```Output
Name       Provider      Root
----       --------      ----

PsDrive    FileSystem    \\Server01\public
X          FileSystem    X:\
```

```powershell
# Get-Member cmdlet shows that the drives have the same object type,
# System.Management.Automation.PSDriveInfo.
Get-PSDrive "PSDrive", "x" | Get-Member
```

```Output
TypeName: System.Management.Automation.PSDriveInfo

Name                MemberType   Definition
----                ----------   ----------
CompareTo           Method       System.Int32 CompareTo(PSDriveInfo drive),
Equals              Method       System.Boolean Equals(Object obj),
GetHashCode         Method       System.Int32 GetHashCode()
...
```

```powershell
# Net Use and Get-CimInstance for the Win32_LogicalDisk class,
# and Win32_NetworkConnection class find only the persistent X: drive.
# PowerShell temporary drives are known only to PowerShell.
Net Use
Get-CimInstance Win32_LogicalDisk | Format-Table -Property DeviceID
Get-CimInstance Win32_NetworkConnection
```

```Output
Status       Local     Remote                    Network
--------------------------------------------------------
OK           X:        \\contoso-pc\data         Microsoft Windows Network

## PARAMETERS

### -Confirm

Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential

Specifies a user account that has permission to do this action. The default is the current user.

Since PowerShell 3.0, when the value of the **Root** parameter is a UNC path, you can use
credentials to create file system drives.

Type a user name, such as **User01** or **Domain01\User01**, or enter a **PSCredential** object
generated by the `Get-Credential` cmdlet. If you type a user name, you're prompted to enter the
password.

Credentials are stored in a [PSCredential](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential)
object and the password is stored as a [SecureString](/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring).

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about **SecureString** data protection, see
> [How secure is SecureString?](/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring#how-secure-is-securestring).

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Current user
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Description

Specifies a brief text description of the drive. Type any string.

To see the descriptions of all the session's drives, `Get-PSDrive | Format-Table Name, Description`.

To see the description of a particular drive, type `(Get-PSDrive <DriveName>).Description`.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name

Specifies a name for the new drive. For persistent mapped network drives, use a drive letter. For
temporary PowerShell drives, you aren't limited to drive letters, use any valid string.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Persist

Indicates that this cmdlet creates a Windows mapped network drive. The **Persist** parameter is only
available on Windows.

Mapped network drives are saved in Windows on the local computer. They're persistent, not
session-specific, and can be viewed and managed in File Explorer and other tools.

When you scope the command locally, without dot-sourcing, the **Persist** parameter doesn't persist
the creation of a **PSDrive** beyond the scope in which you run the command. If you run
`New-PSDrive` inside a script, and you want the new drive to persist indefinitely, you must
dot-source the script. For best results, to force a new drive to persist, specify **Global** as the
value of the **Scope** parameter and include **Persist** in your command.

The name of the drive must be a letter, such as `D` or `E`. The value of **Root** parameter must be
a UNC path of a different computer. The **PSProvider** parameter's value must be `FileSystem`.

To disconnect a Windows mapped network drive, use the `Remove-PSDrive` cmdlet. When you disconnect a
Windows mapped network drive, the mapping is permanently deleted from the computer, not just deleted
from the current session.

Mapped network drives are specific to a user account. Mapped drives created in elevated sessions or
sessions using the credential of another user aren't visible in sessions started using different
credentials.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PSProvider

Specifies the PowerShell provider that supports drives of this kind.

For example, if the drive is associated with a network share or file system directory, the
PowerShell provider is `FileSystem`. If the drive is associated with a registry key, the provider is
`Registry`.

Temporary PowerShell drives can be associated with any PowerShell provider. Mapped network drives
can be associated only with the `FileSystem` provider.

To see a list of the providers in your PowerShell session, use the `Get-PSProvider` cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Root

Specifies the data store location to which a PowerShell drive is mapped.

For example, specify a network share, such as `\\Server01\Public`, a local directory, such as
`C:\Program Files`, or a registry key, such as `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft`.

Temporary PowerShell drives can be associated with a local or remote location on any supported
provider drive. Mapped network drives can be associated only with a file system location on a remote
computer.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Scope

Specifies a scope for the drive. The acceptable values for this parameter are: **Global**,
**Local**, and **Script**, or a number relative to the current scope. Scopes number 0 through the
number of scopes. The current scope number is 0 and its parent is 1. For more information, see
[about_Scopes](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Scopes.md).

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Local
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs. The cmdlet isn't run.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: `-Debug`, `-ErrorAction`, `-ErrorVariable`,
`-InformationAction`, `-InformationVariable`, `-OutVariable`, `-OutBuffer`, `-PipelineVariable`,
