### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Deletes the specified items.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
notes: |-
  The `Remove-Item` cmdlet is designed to work with the data exposed by any provider. To list the
  providers available in your session, type `Get-PsProvider`. For more information, see
  [about_Providers](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Providers.md).

  When you try to delete a folder that contains items without using the **Recurse** parameter, the
  cmdlet prompts for confirmation. Using `-Confirm:$false` does not suppress the prompt. This is by
  design.
inputs:
- name: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    You can pipe a string that contains a path, but not a literal path, to this cmdlet.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="None" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

    This cmdlet does not return any output.

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Delete files that have any file name extension'
  code: |-
    Remove-Item C:\Test\*.*
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example deletes all of the files that have names that include a dot (`.`) from the `C:\Test`
    folder. Because the command specifies a dot, the command does not delete folders or files that have
    no file name extension.

- title: 'Example 2: Delete some of the document files in a folder'
  code: |-
    Remove-Item * -Include *.doc -Exclude *1*
  description: |-
    It uses the wildcard character (`*`) to specify the contents of the current folder. It uses the
    **Include** and **Exclude** parameters to specify the files to delete.
  summary: |+
    This example deletes from the current folder all files that have a `.doc` file name extension and a
    name that does not include `*1*`.

- title: 'Example 3: Delete hidden, read-only files'
  code: |-
    Remove-Item -Path C:\Test\hidden-RO-file.txt -Force
  description: |-
    It uses the **Path** parameter to specify the file. It uses the **Force**
    parameter to delete it. Without **Force**, you cannot delete _read-only_ or
    _hidden_ files.
  summary: |+
    This command deletes a file that is both *hidden* and *read-only*.

- title: 'Example 4: Delete files in subfolders recursively'
  code: |-
    Get-ChildItem * -Include *.csv -Recurse | Remove-Item
  description: |-
    In the `Get-ChildItem` command, **Path** has a value of (`*`), which represents the contents of the
    current folder. It uses **Include** to specify the CSV file type, and it uses **Recurse** to make
    the retrieval recursive. If you try to specify the file type the path, such as `-Path *.csv`, the
    cmdlet interprets the subject of the search to be a file that has no child items, and **Recurse**
    fails.
  summary: |+
    This command deletes all of the CSV files in the current folder and all subfolders recursively.

    Because the **Recurse** parameter in `Remove-Item` has a known issue, the command in this example
    uses `Get-ChildItem` to get the desired files, and then uses the pipeline operator to pass them to
    `Remove-Item`.

- title: 'Example 5: Delete subkeys recursively'
  code: |-
    Remove-Item HKLM:\Software\MyCompany\OldApp -Recurse
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This command deletes the "OldApp" registry key and all its subkeys and values. It uses `Remove-Item`
    to remove the key. The path is specified, but the optional parameter name (**Path**) is omitted.

    The **Recurse** parameter deletes all of the contents of the "OldApp" key recursively. If the key
    contains subkeys and you omit the **Recurse** parameter, you are prompted to confirm that you want
    to delete the contents of the key.

- title: 'Example 6: Deleting files with special characters'
  code: |-

  description: |-
    The **Stream** parameter `Get-Item` gets the `Zone.Identifier` stream of the `Copy-Script.ps1`
    file. `Remove-Item` uses the **Stream** parameter to remove the `Zone.Identifier` stream of the
    file. Finally, the `Get-Item` cmdlet shows that the `Zone.Identifier` stream was deleted.
  summary: |+
    This example shows how to use the **Stream** dynamic parameter of the `Remove-Item` cmdlet to delete
    an alternate data stream. The stream parameter is introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

    Specifies, as a string array, an item or items that this cmdlet excludes in the operation. The value
    of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter. Enter a path element or pattern, such as
    `*.txt`. Wildcard characters are permitted. The **Exclude** parameter is effective only when the
    command includes the contents of an item, such as `C:\Windows\*`, where the wildcard character
    specifies the contents of the `C:\Windows` directory.

  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Specifies a filter to qualify the **Path** parameter. The
    [FileSystem](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_FileSystem_Provider.md) provider is the only
    installed PowerShell provider that supports the use of filters. You can find the syntax for the
    **FileSystem** filter language in
    [about_Wildcards](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Wildcards.md). Filters are more efficient
    than other parameters, because the provider applies them when the cmdlet gets the objects rather
    than having PowerShell filter the objects after they are retrieved.

  name: Force
  description: |+
    Forces the cmdlet to remove items that cannot otherwise be changed, such as hidden or read-only
    files or read-only aliases or variables. The cmdlet cannot remove constant aliases or variables.
    Implementation varies from provider to provider. For more information, see
    [about_Providers](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Providers.md). Even using the **Force**
    parameter, the cmdlet cannot override security restrictions.

  description: |+
    Specifies, as a string array, an item or items that this cmdlet includes in the operation. The value
    of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter. Enter a path element or pattern, such as
    `"*.txt"`. Wildcard characters are permitted. The **Include** parameter is effective only when the
    command includes the contents of an item, such as `C:\Windows\*`, where the wildcard character
    specifies the contents of the `C:\Windows` directory.

  name: LiteralPath
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies a path to one or more locations. The value of **LiteralPath** is used exactly as it is
    typed. No characters are interpreted as wildcards. If the path includes escape characters, enclose
    it in single quotation marks. Single quotation marks tell PowerShell not to interpret any characters
    as escape sequences.

  name: Recurse
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet deletes the items in the specified locations and in all child items of
    the locations.

    When it is used with the **Include** parameter, the **Recurse** parameter might not delete all
    subfolders or all child items. This is a known issue. As a workaround, try piping results of the
    `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` command to `Remove-Item`, as described in "Example 4" in this topic.

  name: Stream
  description: |+
    > [!NOTE]
    > This Parameter is only available on Windows.

    The **Stream** parameter is a dynamic parameter that the FileSystem provider adds to `Remove-Item`.
    This parameter works only in file system drives.

    You can use `Remove-Item` to delete an alternative data stream, such as `Zone.Identifier`.
    However, it is not the recommended way to eliminate security checks that block files that are
    downloaded from the Internet. If you verify that a downloaded file is safe, use the `Unblock-File`
    cmdlet.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  The `Remove-Item` cmdlet deletes one or more items. Because it is supported by many providers, it
  can delete many different types of items, including files, folders, registry keys, variables,
  aliases, and functions.
