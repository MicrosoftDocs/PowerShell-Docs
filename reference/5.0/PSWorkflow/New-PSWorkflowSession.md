# New-PSWorkflowSession

## SYNOPSIS
Creates a workflow session.

## SYNTAX

```
New-PSWorkflowSession [[-ComputerName] <String[]>] [-Credential <Object>] [-Name <String[]>] [-Port <Int32>]
 [-UseSSL] [-ApplicationName <String>] [-ThrottleLimit <Int32>] [-SessionOption <PSSessionOption>]
 [-Authentication <AuthenticationMechanism>] [-CertificateThumbprint <String>] [-EnableNetworkAccess]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **New-PSWorkflowSession** cmdlet creates a user-managed session (**PSSession**) that is especially designed for running Windows PowerShell workflows.
It uses the Microsoft.PowerShell.Workflow session configuration, which includes scripts, type and formatting files, and options that are required for workflows.

You can use **New-PSWorkflowSession** or its alias, nwsn.

You can also add workflow common parameters to this command.
For more information about workflow common parameters, see about_WorkflowCommonParameters

This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Create a workflow session on a remote computer
```
PS C:\> New-PSWorkflowSession -ComputerName "ServerNode01" -Name "WorkflowTests" -SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -OutputBufferingMode Drop)
```

This command creates the WorkflowTests session on the ServerNode01 remote computer.
The value of the *SessionOption* parameter is a **New-PSSessionOption** command that sets the output buffering mode in the session to Drop.

### Example 2: Create workflow sessions on multiple remote computers
```
PS C:\> "ServerNode01", "Server12" | New-PSWorkflowSession -Name WorkflowSession -Credential Domain01\Admin01 -ThrottleLimit 150
```

This command creates workflow sessions on the ServerNode01 and Server12 computers.
The command uses the *Credential* parameter to run with the permissions of the domain administrator.

The command uses the *ThrottleLimit* parameter to increase the per-command throttle limit to 150.
This value takes precedence over the default throttle limit of 100 that is set in the Microsoft.PowerShell.Workflow session configuration.

## PARAMETERS

### -ApplicationName
Specifies the application name segment of the connection URI.

The default value is the value of the $PSSessionApplicationName preference variable on the local computer.
If this preference variable is not defined, the default value is WSMAN.
This value is appropriate for most uses.
For more information, see about_Preference_Variables.

The WinRM service uses the application name to select a listener to service the connection request.
The value of this parameter should match the value of the **URLPrefix** property of a listener on the remote computer.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: WSMAN
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Authentication
Specifies the mechanism that is used to authenticate the user credentials.
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- Default 
- Basic 
- Credssp 
- Digest 
- Kerberos 
- Negotiate 
- NegotiateWithImplicitCredential 

The default value is Default.

CredSSP authentication is available only in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and later versions of the Windows operating system.

For more information about the values of this parameter, see [AuthenticationMechanism Enumeration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.runspaces.authenticationmechanism) in the MSDN library.

Caution: Credential Security Service Provider (CredSSP) authentication, in which the user credentials are passed to a remote computer to be authenticated, is designed for commands that require authentication on more than one resource, such as accessing a remote network share.
This mechanism increases the security risk of the remote operation.
If the remote computer is compromised, the credentials that are passed to it can be used to control the network session.

```yaml
Type: AuthenticationMechanism
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 
Accepted values: Default, Basic, Negotiate, NegotiateWithImplicitCredential, Credssp, Digest, Kerberos

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Default
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CertificateThumbprint
Specifies the digital public key certificate (X509) of a user account that has permission to perform this action.
Enter the certificate thumbprint of the certificate.

Certificates are used in client certificate-based authentication.
They can be mapped only to local user accounts; they do not work with domain accounts.

To get a certificate thumbprint, use the Get-Item cmdlet or the Get-ChildItem cmdlet in the Windows PowerShell Cert: drive.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ComputerName
Creates a persistent connection (**PSSession**) to the specified computer.
If you enter multiple computer names, Windows PowerShell creates multiple **PSSessions**, one for each computer.
The default is the local computer.

Type the NetBIOS name, an IP address, or a fully qualified domain name of one or more remote computers.
To specify the local computer, type the computer name, localhost, or a dot (.).
When the computer is in a different domain than the user, the fully qualified domain name is required.
You can also pipe a computer name, in quotation marks to **New-PSWorkflowSession**.

To use an IP address in the value of the *ComputerName* parameter, the command must include the *Credential* parameter.
Also, the computer must be configured for HTTPS transport or the IP address of the remote computer must be included in the WinRM TrustedHosts list on the local computer.
For instructions for adding a computer name to the TrustedHosts list, see "How to Add a Computer to the Trusted Host List" in about_Remote_Troubleshooting.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: Cn

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: Local computer
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential
Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
The default is the current user.

Type a user name, such as User01, Domain01\User01, or User@Domain.com, or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one returned by the Get-Credential cmdlet.

When you type a user name, this cmdlet prompts you for a password.

```yaml
Type: Object
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Current user
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EnableNetworkAccess
Indicates that this cmdlet adds an interactive security token to loopback sessions.
The interactive token lets you run commands in the loopback session that get data from other computers.
For example, you can run a command in the session that copies XML files from a remote computer to the local computer.

A loopback session is a **PSSession** that originates and ends on the same computer.
To create a loopback session, do not specify the *ComputerName* parameter or set its value to dot, localhost, or the name of the local computer.

By default, loopback sessions are created that have a network token, which might not provide sufficient permission to authenticate to remote computers.

The *EnableNetworkAccess* parameter is effective only in loopback sessions.
If you specify the *EnableNetworkAccess* parameter when you create a session on a remote computer, the command succeeds, but the parameter is ignored.

You can also allow remote access in a loopback session by using the **CredSSP** value of the *Authentication* parameter, which delegates the session credentials to other computers.

To protect the computer from malicious access, disconnected loopback sessions that have interactive tokens, those created by using the **EnableNetworkAccess** parameter, can be reconnected only from the computer on which the session was created.
Disconnected sessions that use CredSSP authentication can be reconnected from other computers.
For more information, see the Disconnect-PSSession cmdlet.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
Specifies a friendly name for the workflow session.

You can use the name to refer to the session when you use other cmdlets, such as Get-PSSession and Enter-PSSession.
The name is not required to be unique to the computer or the current session.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Session#
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Port
Specifies the network port on the remote computer that is used for this connection.
To connect to a remote computer, the remote computer must be listening on the port that the connection uses.
The default ports are 5985, which is the WinRM port for HTTP, and 5986, which is the WinRM port for HTTPS.

Before using another port, you must configure the WinRM listener on the remote computer to listen at that port.
Use the following commands to configure the listener:

`PS C:\\\> winrm delete winrm/config/listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTP`
`PS C:\\\> winrm create winrm/config/listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTP @{Port="\<port-number\>"}`

Do not use the *Port* parameter unless you must.
The port setting in the command applies to all computers or sessions on which the command runs.
An alternate port setting might prevent the command from running on all computers.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 5985, 5986
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SessionOption
Specifies advanced options for the session.
Enter a **SessionOption** object, such as one that you create by using the New-PSSessionOption cmdlet.

The default values for the options are determined by the value of the $PSSessionOption preference variable, if it is set.
Otherwise, the default values are established by options set in the session configuration.

The session option values take precedence over default values for sessions set in the $PSSessionOption preference variable and in the session configuration.
However, they do not take precedence over maximum values, quotas or limits set in the session configuration.
For more information about session configurations, see about_Session_Configurations.

For a description of the session options, including the default values, see **New-PSSessionOption**.
For information about the $PSSessionOption preference variable, see about_Preference_Variables.

```yaml
Type: PSSessionOption
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ThrottleLimit
Specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections that can be established to run this command.
If you omit this parameter or enter a value of 0 (zero), the default value for the Microsoft.PowerShellWorkflow session configuration, 100, is used.

The throttle limit applies only to the current command, not to the session or to the computer.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 100
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UseSSL
Indicates that this cmdlet uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to establish a connection to the remote computer.
By default, SSL is not used.

WS-Management encrypts all Windows PowerShell content transmitted over the network.
The *UseSSL* cmdlet is an additional protection that sends the data across an HTTPS connection instead of an HTTP connection.

If you specify this parameter, but SSL is not available on the port that is used for the command, the command fails.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).
