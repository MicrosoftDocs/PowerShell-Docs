# Out-Host

## SYNOPSIS
Sends output to the command line.

## SYNTAX

```
Out-Host [-Paging] [-InputObject <PSObject>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Out-Host** cmdlet sends output to the Windows PowerShell host for display.
The host displays the output at the command line.
Because **Out-Host** is the default, you do not have to specify it unless you want to use its parameters to change the display.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Display system processes one page at a time
```
PS C:\> Get-Process | Out-Host -Paging
```

This command displays the processes on the system one page at a time.
It uses the Get-Process cmdlet to get the processes on the system.
The pipeline operator sends the results to **Out-Host**, which displays them at the console.
The *Paging* parameter displays one page of data at a time.

The same command format is used for the Help function that is built into Windows PowerShell.
That function gets data from the Get-Help cmdlet and then uses the *Paging* parameter of **Out-Host** to display the data one page at a time by using this command format: `Get-Help $Args\[0\] | Out-Host -Paging`.

### Example 2: Display session history
```
PS C:\> $A = Get-History
PS C:\> Out-Host -InputObject $A
```

The first command uses the Get-History cmdlet to get the session history, and then it stores the history in the $a variable.

The second command uses **Out-Host** to display the content of the $a variable, and it uses the *InputObject* parameter to specify the variable to **Out-Host**.

## PARAMETERS

### -InputObject
Specifies the objects that are written to the console.
Enter a variable that contains the objects, or type a command or expression that gets the objects.

```yaml
Type: PSObject
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Paging
Indicates that this cmdlet displays one page of output at a time, and waits for user input before it displays the remaining pages, much like the traditional **more** command.
By default, all of the output is displayed on a single page.
The page size is determined by the characteristics of the host.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### System.Management.Automation.PSObject
You can pipe any object to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### None
This cmdlet does not generate any output.
However, the host might display the objects that **Out-Host** sends to it.

## NOTES
* The cmdlets that contain the **Out** verb (the **Out** cmdlets) do not format objects. They just render objects and send them to the specified display destination. If you send an unformatted object to an **Out** cmdlet, the cmdlet sends it to a formatting cmdlet before rendering it.
* The **Out** cmdlets do not have parameters for names or file paths. To send data to an **Out** cmdlet, use a pipeline operator (|) to send the output of a Windows PowerShell command to the cmdlet. You can also store data in a variable and use the *InputObject* parameter to pass the data to the cmdlet. For help, see the examples.
* **Out-Host** sends data, but it does not emit any output objects. If you pipe the output of **Out-Host** to the Get-Member cmdlet, **Get-Member** reports that no objects have been specified.
