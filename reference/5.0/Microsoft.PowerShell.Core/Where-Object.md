## Description

The `Where-Object` cmdlet selects objects that have particular property values from the collection of objects that are passed to it.
For example, you can use the `Where-Object` cmdlet to select files that were created after a certain date, events with a particular ID, or computers that use a particular version of Windows.

Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, there are two different ways to construct a `Where-Object` command.

- **Script block**.
  You can use a script block to specify the property name, a comparison operator, and a property value.
  `Where-Object` returns all objects for which the script block statement is true.

  For example, the following command gets processes in the Normal priority class, that is, processes where the value of the **PriorityClass** property equals Normal.

  `Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.PriorityClass -eq "Normal"}`

  All Windows PowerShell comparison operators are valid in the script block format.
  For more information about comparison operators, see [about_Comparison_Operators](./About/about_Comparison_Operators.md).

- **Comparison statement**.
  You can also write a comparison statement, which is much more like natural language.
  Comparison statements were introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  For example, the following commands also get processes that have a priority class of Normal.
  These commands are equivalent and can be used interchangeably.

  `Get-Process | Where-Object -Property PriorityClass -eq -Value "Normal"`

  `Get-Process | Where-Object PriorityClass -eq "Normal"`

  Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, **Where-Object** adds comparison operators as parameters in a **Where-Object** command.
  Unless specified, all operators are case-insensitive.
  Prior to Windows PowerShell 3.0, the comparison operators in the Windows PowerShell language could be used only in script blocks.

## Examples

### Example 1: Get stopped services

These commands get a list of all services that are currently stopped.

The `$_` automatic variable represents each object that is passed to the `Where-Object` cmdlet.

The first command uses the script block format, the second command uses the comparison statement format.

The commands are equivalent and can be used interchangeably.

```powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Stopped"}
Get-Service | where Status -eq "Stopped"
```

### Example 2: Get processes based on working set

These commands list processes that have a working set greater than 25,000 kilobytes (KB).
Because the value of the **WorkingSet** property is stored in bytes, the value of 25,000 is multiplied by 1,024.

The scriptblock and statement syntax are equivalent and can be used interchangeably.

```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.WorkingSet -GT 25000*1024}
Get-Process | Where-Object WorkingSet -GT (25000*1024)
```

### Example 3: Get processes based on process name

These commands get the processes that have a **ProcessName** property value that begins with the letter *p*.
The **Match** operator lets you use regular expression matches.

The scriptblock and statement syntax are equivalent and can be used interchangeably.

```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -Match "^p.*"}
Get-Process | Where-Object ProcessName -Match "^p.*"
```

### Example 4: Use the comparison statement format

This example shows how to use the new comparison statement format of the `Where-Object` cmdlet.

The first command uses the comparison statement format.
In this command, no aliases are used and all parameters include the parameter name.

The second command is the more natural use of the comparison command format.
The **where** alias is substituted for the `Where-Object` cmdlet name and all optional parameter names are omitted.

```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object -Property Handles -GE -Value 1000
Get-Process | where Handles -GE 1000
```

### Example 5: Get commands based on properties

This example shows how to write commands that return items that are true or false or have any value for a specified property.
Each example shows both the script block and comparison statement formats for the command.

```powershell
# Use Where-Object to get commands that have any value for the OutputType property of the command.
# This omits commands that do not have an OutputType property and those that have an OutputType property, but no property value.
Get-Command | where OutputType
Get-Command | where {$_.OutputType}
```

```powershell
# Use Where-Object to get objects that are containers.
# This gets objects that have the **PSIsContainer** property with a value of $True and excludes all others.
Get-ChildItem | where PSIsContainer -eq $False
```

```powershell
# Finally, use the Not operator (!) to get objects that are not containers.
# This gets objects that do have the **PSIsContainer** property and those that have a value of $False for the **PSIsContainer** property.
Get-ChildItem | where {!$_.PSIsContainer}
# You cannot use the Not operator (!) in the comparison statement format of the command.
Get-ChildItem | where PSIsContainer -eq $False
```

### Example 6: Use multiple conditions

```powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable | where {($_.Name -notlike "Microsoft*" -and $_.Name -notlike "PS*") -and $_.HelpInfoUri}
```

This example shows how to create a `Where-Object` command with multiple conditions.

This command gets non-core modules that support the Updatable Help feature.
The command uses the *ListAvailable* parameter of the `Get-Module` cmdlet to get all modules on the computer.
A pipeline operator (|) sends the modules to the `Where-Object` cmdlet, which gets modules whose names do not begin with Microsoft or PS, and have a value for the **HelpInfoURI** property, which tells Windows PowerShell where to find updated help files for the module.
The comparison statements are connected by the **And** logical operator.

The example uses the script block command format.
Logical operators, such as **And** and **Or**, are valid only in script blocks.
You cannot use them in the comparison statement format of a `Where-Object` command.

- For more information about Windows PowerShell logical operators, see [about_Logical_Operators](./About/about_logical_operators.md).
- For more information about the Updatable Help feature, see [about_Updatable_Help](./About/about_Updatable_Help.md).

```

### -In

Indicates that this cmdlet gets objects if the property value matches any of the specified values.

For example: `Get-Process | where -Property ProcessName -in -Value "Svchost", "TaskHost", "WsmProvHost"`

If the value of the *Value* parameter is a single object, Windows PowerShell converts it to a collection of one object.

If the property value of an object is an array, Windows PowerShell uses reference equality to determine a match.
**Where-Object** returns the object only if the value of the *Property* parameter and any value of *Value* are the same instance of an object.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: InSet
Aliases: IIn

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InputObject

Specifies the objects to be filtered.
You can also pipe the objects to **Where-Object**.

When you use the *InputObject* parameter with **Where-Object**, instead of piping command results to **Where-Object**, the *InputObject* value is treated as a single object.
This is true even if the value is a collection that is the result of a command, such as `-InputObject (Get-Process)`.
Because *InputObject* cannot return individual properties from an array or collection of objects, we recommend that, if you use **Where-Object** to filter a collection of objects for those objects that have specific values in defined properties, you use **Where-Object** in the pipeline, as shown in the examples in this topic.

```yaml
Type: PSObject
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Is

Indicates that this cmdlet gets objects if the property value is an instance of the specified .NET Framework type.
Enclose the type name in square brackets.

For example, `Get-Process | where StartTime -Is [DateTime]`

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter

Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IsNot

Indicates that this cmdlet gets objects if the property value is not an instance of the specified .NET Framework type.

For example, `Get-Process | where StartTime -IsNot [DateTime]`

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: IsNotSet
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

Aliases: ILike

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Match

Indicates that this cmdlet gets objects if the property value matches the specified regular expression.
When the input is scalar, the matched value is saved in $Matches automatic variable.

For example: `Get-Process | where ProcessName -Match "shell"`

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: MatchSet
Aliases: IMatch

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

```

### -NE

Indicates that this cmdlet gets objects if the property value is different than the specified value.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: NotEqualSet
Aliases: INE

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NotContains

Indicates that this cmdlet gets objects if none of the items in the property value is an exact match for the specified value.

For example: `Get-Process | where ProcessName -NotContains "Svchost"`

*NotContains* refers to a collection of values and is true if the collection does not contain any items that are an exact match for the specified value.
If the input is a single object, Windows PowerShell converts it to a collection of one object.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: NotContainsSet
Aliases: INotContains

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NotIn

Indicates that this cmdlet gets objects if the property value is not an exact match for any of the specified values.

For example: `Get-Process | where -Value "svchost" -NotIn -Property ProcessName`

If the value of *Value* is a single object, Windows PowerShell converts it to a collection of one object.

If the property value of an object is an array, Windows PowerShell uses reference equality to determine a match.
**Where-Object** returns the object only if the value of *Property* and any value of *Value* are not the same instance of an object.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
