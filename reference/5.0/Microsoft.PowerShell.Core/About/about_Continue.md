# About Continue
## about_Continue


# SHORT DESCRIPTION

Describes how the Continue statement immediately returns the program flow
to the top of a program loop.

# LONG DESCRIPTION

In a script, the Continue statement immediately returns the program flow
to the top of the innermost loop that is controlled by a For, Foreach, or
While statement.

The Continue keyword supports labels. A label is a name you assign to a
statement in a script. For information about labels, see about_Break.

In the following example, program flow returns to the top of the While loop
if the $ctr variable is equal to 5. As a result, all the numbers between 1
and 10 are displayed except for 5:

while ($ctr -lt 10)
{
$ctr +=1
if ($ctr -eq 5) {continue}
Write-Host $ctr
}

Note that in a For loop, execution continues at the first line in the
loop. If the arguments of the For statement test a value that is
modified by the For statement, an infinite loop may result.
