# About While

## SHORT DESCRIPTION
Describes a language statement that you can use to run a command block
based on the results of a conditional test.

## LONG DESCRIPTION

The While statement (also known as a While loop) is a language construct
for creating a loop that runs commands in a command block as long as a
conditional test evaluates to true. The While statement is easier to
construct than a For statement because its syntax is less complicated. In
addition, it is more flexible than the Foreach statement because you
specify a conditional test in the While statement to control how many times
the loop runs.

The following shows the While statement syntax:

```powershell
while (<condition>){<statement list>}
```

When you run a While statement, PowerShell evaluates the `<condition>`
section of the statement before entering the `<statement list>` section. The
condition portion of the statement resolves to either true or false. As
long as the condition remains true, PowerShell reruns the `<statement list>`
section.

The `<statement list>` section of the statement contains one or more
commands that are run each time the loop is entered or repeated.

For example, the following While statement displays the numbers 1 through 3
if the $val variable has not been created or if the $val variable has been
created and initialized to 0.

```powershell
while($val -ne 3)
{
    $val++
    Write-Host $val
}
```

In this example, the condition ($val is not equal to 3) is true while $val
\= 0, 1, 2. Each time through the loop, $val is incremented by 1 using the
\+\+ unary increment operator ($val\+\+). The last time through the loop,
$val \= 3. When $val equals 3, the condition statement evaluates to false,
and the loop exits.

To conveniently write this command at the PowerShell command prompt, you
can enter it in the following way:

```powershell
while($val -ne 3){$val++; Write-Host $val}
```

Notice that the semicolon separates the first command that adds 1 to $val
from the second command that writes the value of $val to the console.
