# About Redirection
## about_Redirection


## SHORT DESCRIPTION
Explains how to redirect output from  Windows PowerShell?to text files.


## LONG DESCRIPTION
By default, Windows PowerShell sends its command output to the  Windows PowerShell console. However, you can direct the output to a text file, and you can redirect error output to the regular output stream.

You can use the following methods to redirect output:

- Use the Out-File cmdlet, which sends command output to a text file. Typically, you use the Out-File cmdlet when you need to use its parameters, such as the Encoding, Force, Width, or NoClobber parameters.

- Use the Tee-Object cmdlet, which sends command output to a text file and then sends it to the pipeline.

- Use the Windows PowerShell redirection operators.


### WINDOWS POWERSHELL REDIRECTION OPERATORS
The redirection operators enable you to send particular types of output to files and to the success output stream.

The  Windows PowerShell redirection operators use the following characters to represent each output type:


```
*   All output  
1   Success output  
2   Errors  
3   Warning messages  
4   Verbose output  
5   Debug messages
```


NOTE: The All (\*), Warning (3), Verbose (4) and Debug (5) redirection operators were introduced in  Windows PowerShell 3.0. They do not work in earlier versions of  Windows PowerShell.

The Windows PowerShell redirection operators are as follows.


```
Operator  Description                Example    
--------  ----------------------     ------------------------------  
>         Sends output to the        Get-Process > Process.txt  
          specified file.  
  
>>        Appends the output to      dir *.ps1 >> Scripts.txt  
          the contents of the    
          specified file.  
  
2>        Sends errors to the        Get-Process none 2> Errors.txt  
          specified file.  
  
2>>       Appends errors to          Get-Process none 2>> Save-Errors.txt  
          the contents of the   
          specified file.  
  
2>&1      Sends errors (2) and       Get-Process none, Powershell 2>&1  
          success output (1)   
          to the success   
          output stream.  
  
3>        Sends warnings to the      Write-Warning "Test!" 3> Warnings.txt  
          specified file.  
  
3>>       Appends warnings to        Write-Warning "Test!" 3>> Save-Warnings.txt  
          the contents of the   
          specified file.  
  
3>&1      Sends warnings (3) and     function Test-Warning   
          success output (1)         {  Get-Process PowerShell;   
          to the success                Write-Warning "Test!" }  
          output stream.             Test-Warning 3>&1  
  
4>        Sends verbose output to    Import-Module * -Verbose 4> Verbose.txt  
          the specified file.  
  
4>>       Appends verbose output     Import-Module * -Verbose 4>> Save-Verbose.txt  
          to the contents of the   
          specified file.  
  
4>&1      Sends verbose output (4)   Import-Module * -Verbose 4>&1  
          and success output (1)      
          to the success output  
          stream.                
  
5>        Sends debug messages to    Write-Debug "Starting" 5> Debug.txt  
          the specified file.  
  
5>>       Appends debug messages     Write-Debug "Saving" 5>> Save-Debug.txt  
          to the contents of the   
          specified file.  
  
5>&1      Sends debug messages (5)   function Test-Debug   
          and success output (1)     { Get-Process PowerShell   
          to the success output        Write-Debug "PS" }  
          stream.                    Test-Debug 5>&1  
  
*>        Sends all output types     function Test-Output  
          to the specified file.     { Get-Process PowerShell, none    
                                       Write-Warning "Test!"  
*>>       Appends all output types     Write-Verbose "Test Verbose"  
          to the contents of the       Write-Debug "Test Debug" }   
          specified file.              
                                     Test-Output *> Test-Output.txt  
*>&1      Sends all output types     Test-Output *>> Test-Output.txt  
          (*) to the success output  Test-Output *>&1        
          stream.
```


The syntax of the redirection operators is as follows:


```
<input> <operator> [<path>\]<file>
```


If the specified file already exists, the redirection operators that do not append data (> and n>) overwrite the current contents of the file without warning. However, if the file is a read-only, hidden, or system file, the redirection fails. The append redirection operators (>> and n>>) do not write to a read-only file, but they append content to a system or hidden file.

To force the redirection of content to a read-only, hidden, or system file, use the Out-File cmdlet with its Force parameter. When you are writing to files, the redirection operators use Unicode encoding. If the file has a different encoding, the output might not be formatted correctly. To redirect content to non-Unicode files, use the Out-File cmdlet with its Encoding parameter.
