TOPIC  
    about_Windows_PowerShell_5.0  
  
SHORT DESCRIPTION  
    Describes new features that are included in   
    Windows PowerShell 5.0.  
  
LONG DESCRIPTION  
  
    Windows PowerShell 5.0 includes significant new features that extend its  
    use, improve its usability, and allow you to control and manage Windows-based  
    environments more easily and comprehensively.  
  
    Windows PowerShell 5.0 is backward-compatible. Cmdlets, providers, modules,   
    snap-ins, scripts, functions, and profiles that were designed for Windows  
    PowerShell 4.0, Windows PowerShell 3.0, and Windows PowerShell 2.0 generally  
    work in Windows PowerShell 5.0 without changes.  
  
    Windows PowerShell 5.0 is installed by default on Windows Server Technical  
    Preview and Windows Technical Preview. To install Windows PowerShell 5.0 on  
    Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 8.1 Enterprise, or Windows 8.1 Pro, download  
    and install Windows Management Framework 5.0 Preview.   
    (http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=44070)  
    Be sure to read the download details, and meet all system requirements,  
    before you install Windows Management Framework 5.0 Preview.  
  
    You can also read about changes to Windows PowerShell 5.0 in the Microsoft  
    TechNet topic, "What's New in Windows PowerShell."  
    (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=512808)  
  
NEW FEATURES  
  
    New features in Windows PowerShell  
  
    -- Starting in Windows PowerShell 5.0, you can develop by using classes,  
       by using formal syntax and semantics that are similar to other object-oriented  
       programming languages. Class, Enum, and other keywords have been added to the  
       Windows PowerShell language to support the new feature. For more information  
       about working with classes, see about_Classes.  
    -- In collaboration with Microsoft Research, a new cmdlet, ConvertFrom-String,  
       has been added. ConvertFrom-String lets you extract and parse structured   
       objects from the content of text strings. For more information, see  
       ConvertFrom-String.  
    -- A new module, Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive, includes cmdlets that let you   
       compress files and folders into archive (also known as ZIP) files, extract  
       files from existing ZIP files, and update ZIP files with newer versions  
       of files compressed within them.  
    -- A new module, OneGet, lets you discover and install software packages on  
       the Internet. The OneGet module is a manager or multiplexer of existing  
       package managers (also called package providers) to unify Windows package  
       management with a single Windows PowerShell interface.  
    -- A new module, PowerShellGet, lets you find, install, publish, and update  
       modules and DSC resources on the PowerShell Resource Gallery, or on an internal  
       module repository that you can set up by running the Register-PSRepository cmdlet.  
    -- New-Item, Remove-Item, and Get-ChildItem have been enhanced to support   
       creating and managing symbolic links. The ItemType parameter for New-Item  
       accepts a new value, SymbolicLink. Now you can create symbolic links in a  
       single line by running the New-Item cmdlet.  
    -- Windows PowerShell transcription has been improved to apply to all hosting  
       applications (such as Windows PowerShell ISE) in addition to the console host  
       (powershell.exe). Transcription options (including enabling a system-wide   
       transcript) can be configured by enabling the Turn on PowerShell Transcription  
       Group Policy setting, found in  
       Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows PowerShell.  
    -- A new detailed script tracing feature lets you enable detailed tracking and  
       analysis of Windows PowerShell scripting use on a system. After you enable  
       detailed script tracing, Windows PowerShell logs all script blocks to the  
       Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) event log, Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational.  
    -- Starting in Windows PowerShell 5.0, new Cryptographic Message Syntax cmdlets  
       support encryption and decryption of content by using the IETF standard format  
       for cryptographically protecting messages as documented by RFC5652  
       (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652). The Get-CmsMessage, Protect-CmsMessage,  
       and Unprotect-CmsMessage cmdlets have been added to the   
       Microsoft.PowerShell.Security module.  
    -- New cmdlets in the Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility module, Get-Runspace,  
       Debug-Runspace, Get-RunspaceDebug, Enable-RunspaceDebug, and   
       Disable-RunspaceDebug, let you set debug options on a runspace, and start  
       and stop debugging on a runspace. For debugging arbitrary runspaces—that is,  
       runspaces that are not the default runspace for a Windows PowerShell console  
       or Windows PowerShell ISE session—Windows PowerShell lets you set breakpoints  
       in a script, and have added breakpoints stop the script from running until  
       you can attach a debugger to debug the runspace script. Nested debugging  
       support for arbitrary runspaces has been added to the Windows PowerShell  
       script debugger for runspaces.  
    -- New cmdlets Enter-PSHostProcess and Exit-PSHostProcess let you debug   
       Windows PowerShell scripts in processes separate from the current process  
       that is running in the Windows PowerShell console. Run Enter-PSHostProcess  
       to enter, or attach to, a specific process ID, and then run Get-Runspace to  
       return the active runspaces within the process. Run Exit-PSHostProcess to  
       detach from the process when you are finished debugging the script within   
       the process.  
    -- A new Wait-Debugger cmdlet has been added to the Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility  
       module. You can run Wait-Debugger to stop a script in the debugger before   
       running the next statement in the script.  
    -- The Windows PowerShell Workflow debugger now supports command or tab completion,  
       and you can debug nested workflow functions. You can now press Ctrl+Break to  
       enter the debugger in a running script, in both local and remote sessions, and  
       in a workflow script.  
    -- A Debug-Job cmdlet has been added to the Microsoft.PowerShell.Core module to  
       debug running job scripts for Windows PowerShell Workflow, background, and   
       jobs running in remote sessions.  
    -- A new state, AtBreakpoint, has been added for Windows PowerShell jobs. The  
       AtBreakpoint state applies when a job is running a script that includes set  
       breakpoints, and the script has hit a breakpoint. When a job is stopped at a  
       debug breakpoint, you must debug the job by running the Debug-Job cmdlet.  
    -- Windows PowerShell 5.0 implements support for multiple versions of a single  
       Windows PowerShell module in the same folder in $PSModulePath. A   
       RequiredVersion property has been added to the ModuleSpecification class to  
       help you get the desired version of a module; this property is   
       mutually-exclusive with the ModuleVersion property. RequiredVersion is now  
       supported as part of the value of the FullyQualifiedName parameter of the  
       Get-Module, Import-Module, and Remove-Module cmdlets.  
    -- You can now perform module version validation by running the   
       Test-ModuleManifest cmdlet.  
    -- Results of the Get-Command cmdlet now display a Version column; a new Version  
       property has been added to the CommandInfo class. Get-Command shows commands  
       from multiple versions of the same module. The Version property is also part  
       of derived classes of CmdletInfo: CmdletInfo and ApplicationInfo.  
    -- A new Get-ItemPropertyValue cmdlet lets you get the value of a property without  
       using dot notation. For example, in older releases of Windows PowerShell, you  
       can run the following command to get the value of the Application Base property  
       of the PowerShellEngine registry key: (Get-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SOFTWARE\  
       Microsoft\PowerShell\3\PowerShellEngine -Name ApplicationBase).ApplicationBase.  
       Starting in Windows PowerShell 5.0, you can run Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path HKLM:  
       \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\3\PowerShellEngine -Name ApplicationBase.  
    -- A new NetworkSwitch module contains cmdlets that enable you to apply switch,  
       virtual LAN (VLAN), and basic Layer 2 network switch port configuration to  
       Windows Server 2012 R2 (and later releases) logo-certified network switches.  
    -- The FullyQualifiedName parameter has been added to Import-Module and  
       Remove-Module cmdlets, to support storing multiple versions of a single module.  
    -- Save-Help, Update-Help, Import-PSSession, Export-PSSession, and Get-Command  
       have a new parameter, FullyQualifiedModule, of type ModuleSpecification. Add  
       this parameter to specify a module by its fully qualified name.  
    -- The value of $PSVersionTable.PSVersion has been updated to 5.0.  
  
    New features in Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration  
  
    -- Windows PowerShell language enhancements let you define Windows PowerShell  
       Desired State Configuration (DSC) resources by using classes.  
       Import-DscResource is now a true dynamic keyword; Windows PowerShell parses  
       the specified module’s root module, searching for classes that contain the  
       DscResource attribute. You can now use classes to define DSC resources,  
       in which neither a MOF file nor a DSCResource subfolder in the module  
       folder is required. A Windows PowerShell module file can contain multiple  
       DSC resource classes.  
    -- A new parameter, ThrottleLimit, has been added to the following cmdlets in  
       the PSDesiredStateConfiguration module. Add the ThrottleLimit parameter   
       to specify the number of target computers or devices on which you want the  
       command to work at the same time.  
         -- Get-DscConfiguration  
         -- Get-DscConfigurationStatus  
         -- Get-DscLocalConfigurationManager  
         -- Restore-DscConfiguration  
         -- Test-DscConfiguration  
         -- Compare-DscConfiguration  
         -- Publish-DscConfiguration  
         -- Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager  
         -- Start-DscConfiguration  
         -- Update-DscConfiguration  
    -- With centralized DSC error reporting, rich error information is not only  
       logged in the event log, but it can be sent to a central location for later  
       analysis. You can use this central location to store DSC configuration errors  
       that have occurred for any server in their environment. After the report  
       server is defined in the meta-configuration, all errors are sent to the  
       report server, and then stored in a database. You can set up this functionality  
       regardless of whether or not a target node is configured to pull configurations  
       from a pull server.  
    -- Improvements to Windows PowerShell ISE ease DSC resource authoring. You can  
       now do the following.  
         -- List all DSC resources within a configuration or node block by entering  
            Ctrl+Space on a blank line within the block.  
         -- Automatic completion on resource properties of the enumeration type.  
         -- Automatic completion on the DependsOn property of DSC resources, based  
            on other resource instances in the configuration.  
         -- Improved tab completion of resource property values.  
    -- A new DscLocalConfigurationManager attribute designates a configuration block  
       as a meta-configuration, which is used to configure the DSC Local Configuration  
       Manager. This attribute restricts a configuration to containing only items  
       which configure the DSC Local Configuration Manager. During processing,   
       this configuration generates a *.meta.mof file that is then sent to the  
       appropriate target nodes by running the Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager cmdlet.  
    -- Partial configurations are now allowed in Windows PowerShell 5.0. You can  
       deliver configuration documents to a node in fragments. For a node to receive  
       multiple fragments of a configuration document, the node’s Local Configuration  
       Manager must be first set to specify the expected fragments.  
    -- Cross-computer synchronization is new in DSC in Windows PowerShell 5.0. By  
       using the built-in WaitFor* resources (WaitForAll, WaitForAny, and  
       WaitForSome), you can now specify dependencies across computers during  
       configuration runs, without external orchestrations. These resources provide  
       node-to-node synchronization by using CIM connections over the WS-Man protocol.  
       A configuration can wait for another computer’s specific resource state to change.  
    -- Just Enough Administration (JEA), a new delegation security feature, leverages  
       DSC and Windows PowerShell constrained runspaces to help secure enterprises  
       from data loss or compromise by employees, whether intentional or unintentional.  
       For more information about JEA, including where you can download the xJEA DSC  
       resource, see Just Enough Administration, Step by Step.  
       (http://ppe.blogs.technet.com/b/privatecloud/archive/2014/05/14/just-enough-administration-step-by-step.aspx)  
    -- The following new cmdlets have been added to the PSDesiredStateConfiguration  
       module.  
         -- A new Get-DscConfigurationStatus cmdlet gets high-level information about  
            configuration status from a target node. You can obtain the status of the  
            last, or of all configurations.  
         -- A new Compare-DscConfiguration cmdlet compares a specified configuration  
            with the actual state of one or more target nodes.  
         -- A new Publish-DscConfiguration cmdlet copies a configuration MOF file to   
            a target node, but does not apply the configuration. The configuration is  
            applied during the next consistency pass, or when you run the  
            Update-DscConfiguration cmdlet.  
         -- A new Test-DscConfiguration cmdlet lets you verify that a resulting  
            configuration matches the desired configuration, returning either True if  
            the configuration matches the desired configuration, or False if the actual  
            configuration does not match the desired configuration.  
         -- A new Update-DscConfiguration cmdlet forces a configuration to be processed.  
            If the Local Configuration Manager is in pull mode, the cmdlet gets the   
            configuration from the pull server before applying it.  
  
    New features in Windows PowerShell ISE  
    -- You can now edit remote Windows PowerShell scripts and files in a local copy of  
       Windows PowerShell ISE, by running Enter-PSSession to start a remote session on   
       the computer that’s storing the files you want to edit, and then running PSEdit  
       <path and file name on the remote computer>. This feature eases editing Windows  
       PowerShell files that are stored on the Server Core installation option of  
       Windows Server, where Windows PowerShell ISE cannot run.  
    -- The Start-Transcript cmdlet is now supported in Windows PowerShell ISE.  
    -- You can now debug remote scripts in Windows PowerShell ISE.  
    -- A new menu command, Break All (Ctrl+B), breaks into the debugger for both  
       local and remotely-running scripts.  
  
    New features in Windows PowerShell Web Services (Management OData IIS Extension)  
    -- Starting in Windows PowerShell 5.0, you can generate a set of Windows PowerShell  
       cmdlets based on the functionality exposed by a given OData endpoint, by  
       running the Export-ODataEndpointProxy cmdlet.  
  
    Notable bug fixes in Windows PowerShell 5.0  
    -- Windows PowerShell 5.0 includes a new COM implementation, which offers  
       significant performance improvements when you are working with COM objects.  
       For a video demonstration of the effect, see Com_Perf_Improvements.
