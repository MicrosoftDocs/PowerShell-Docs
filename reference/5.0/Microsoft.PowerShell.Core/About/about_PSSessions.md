# About PSSessions

## Short Description

Describes Windows PowerShell sessions (PSSessions) and explains how to
establish a persistent connection to a remote computer.

## Long Description

To run Windows PowerShell commands on a remote computer, you can use the
**ComputerName** parameter of a cmdlet, or you can create a Windows PowerShell
session (PSSession) and run commands in the PSSession.

When you create a PSSession, Windows PowerShell establishes a persistent
connection to the remote computer. Use a PSSession to run a series of related
commands on a remote computer. Commands that run in the same PSSession can
share data, such as the values of variables, aliases, and functions.

You can also create a PSSession on the local computer and run commands in it.
A local PSSession uses the Windows PowerShell remoting infrastructure to
create and maintain the PSSession.

Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, PSSessions are independent of the
sessions in which they are created. Active PSSessions are maintained on the
remote computer (or the computer at the remote end or "server-side" of the
connection). As a result, you can disconnect from the PSSession and reconnect
to it at a later time from the same computer or from a different computer.

This topic explains how to create, use, get, and delete PSSessions. For more
advanced information, see
[about_PSSession_Details](about_PSSession_Details.md).

Note: PSSessions use the Windows PowerShell remoting infrastructure. To use
PSSessions, the local and remote computers must be configured for remoting.
For more information, see
[about_Remote_Requirements](about_Remote_Requirements.md).

In Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, to create a PSSession on a
local computer, you must start Windows PowerShell with the "Run as
administrator" option.

## What Is a Session?

A session is an environment in which Windows PowerShell runs.

Each time you start Windows PowerShell, a session is created for you, and you
can run commands in the session. You can also add items to your session, such
as modules and snap-ins, and you can create items, such as variables,
functions, and aliases. These items exist only in the session and are deleted
when the session ends.

You can also create user-managed sessions, known as " Windows PowerShell
sessions" or "PSSessions," on the local computer or on a remote computer. Like
the default session, you can run commands in a PSSession and add and create
items. However, unlike the session that starts automatically, you can control
the PSSessions that you create. You can get, create, configure, and remove
them, disconnect and reconnect to them, and run multiple commands in the same
PSSession. The PSSession remains available until you delete it or it times
out.

Typically, you create a PSSession to run a series of related commands on a
remote computer. When you create a PSSession on a remote computer, Windows
PowerShell establishes a persistent connection to the remote computer to
support the session.

If you use the **ComputerName** parameter of the `Invoke-Command` or
`Enter-PSSession` cmdlet to run a remote command or to start an interactive
session, Windows PowerShell creates a temporary session on the remote computer
and closes the session as soon as the command is complete or as soon as the
interactive session ends. You cannot control these temporary sessions, and you
cannot use them for more than a single command or a single interactive
session.

In Windows PowerShell, the "current session" is the session that you are
working in. The "current session" can refer to any session, including a
temporary session or a PSSession.

## Why Use a PSSession?

Use a PSSession when you need a persistent connection to a remote computer.
With a PSSession, you can run a series of commands that share data, such as
the value of variables, the contents of a function, or the definition of an
alias.

You can run remote commands without creating a PSSession. Use the
**ComputerName** parameter of remote-enabled cmdlets to run a single command
or a series of unrelated commands on one or many computers.

When you use the **ComputerName** parameter of `Invoke-Command` or
`Enter-PSSession`, Windows PowerShell establishes a temporary connection to
the remote computer and then closes the connection as soon as the command is
complete. Any data elements that you create are lost when the connection is
closed.

Other cmdlets that have a **ComputerName** parameter, such as `Get-Eventlog`
and `Get-WmiObject`, use different remoting technologies to gather data. None
create a persistent connection like a PSSession.

## How to Create a PSSession

To create a PSSession, use the `New-PSSession` cmdlet. To create the PSSession
on a remote computer, use the **ComputerName** parameter of the
`New-PSSession` cmdlet.

For example, the following command creates a new PSSession on the Server01
computer.

```powershell
New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01
```

When you submit the command, `New-PSSession` creates the PSSession and returns
an object that represents the PSSession. You can save the object in a variable
when you create the PSSession, or you can use a `Get-PSSession` command to get
the PSSession at a later time.

For example, the following command creates a new PSSession on the Server01
computer and saves the resulting object in the $ps variable.

```powershell
$ps = New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01
```

## How to Create PSSessions on Multiple Computers

To create PSSessions on multiple computers, use the **ComputerName** parameter
of the `New-PSSession` cmdlet. Type the names of the remote computers in a
comma-separated list.

For example, to create PSSessions on the Server01, Server02, and Server03
computers, type:

```powershell
New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01, Server02, Server03
```

`New-PSSession` creates one PSSession on each of the remote computers.

## How to Get PSSessions

To get the PSSessions that were created in your current session, use the
`Get-PSSession` cmdlet without the **ComputerName** parameter. `Get-PSSession`
returns the same type of object that `New-PSSession` returns.

The following command gets all the PSSessions that were created in the current session.

```powershell
Get-PSSession
```

The default display of the PSSessions shows their ID and a default display
name. You can assign an alternate display name when you create the session.

```output
Id   Name       ComputerName    State    ConfigurationName
---  ----       ------------    -----    ---------------------
1    Session1   Server01        Opened   Microsoft.PowerShell
2    Session2   Server02        Opened   Microsoft.PowerShell
3    Session3   Server03        Opened   Microsoft.PowerShell
```

You can also save the PSSessions in a variable. The following command gets the
PSSessions and saves them in the \$ps123 variable.

```powershell
$ps123 = Get-PSSession
```

When using the PSSession cmdlets, you can refer to a PSSession by its ID, by
its name, or by its instance ID (a GUID). The following command gets a
PSSession by its ID and saves it in the \$ps01 variable.

```powershell
$ps01 = Get-PSSession -Id 1
```

Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, PSSessions are maintained on the remote
computer. To get PSSessions that you created on particular remote computers,
use the **ComputerName** parameter of the `Get-PSSession` cmdlet. The
following command gets the PSSessions that you created on the Server01 remote
computer. This includes PSSessions created in the current session and in other
sessions on the local computer or other computers.

```powershell
Get-PSSession -ComputerName Server01
```

In Windows PowerShell 2.0, `Get-PSSession` gets only the PSSessions that were
created in the current session. It does not get PSSessions that were created
in other sessions or on other computers, even if the sessions are connected to
and are running commands on the local computer.

## How to Run Commands in a PSSession

To run a command in one or more PSSessions, use the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet.
Use the Session parameter to specify the PSSessions and the **ScriptBlock**
parameter to specify the command.

For example, to run a `Get-ChildItem` ("dir") command in each of the three
PSSessions saved in the $ps123 variable, type:

```powershell
Invoke-Command -Session $ps123 -ScriptBlock { Get-ChildItem }
```

## How to Delete PSSessions

When you are finished with the PSSession, use the `Remove-PSSession` cmdlet to
delete the PSSession and to release the resources that it was using.

```powershell
Remove-PSSession -Session $ps
```

or

```powershell
Remove-PSSession -Id 1
```

To remove a PSSession from a remote computer, use the **ComputerName**
parameter of the `Remove-PSSession` cmdlet.

```powershell
Remove-PSSession -ComputerName Server01 -Id 1
```

If you do not delete the PSSession, the PSSession remains available for use
until it times out.

You can also use the **IdleTimeout** parameter of the `New-PSSessionOption`
cmdlet to set an expiration time for an idle PSSession. For more information,
see [New-PSSessionOption](../New-PSSessionOption.md).
