# About Regular Expressions
## about_Regular_Expressions


# SHORT DESCRIPTION

Describes regular expressions in Windows PowerShell.

# LONG DESCRIPTION

Windows PowerShell supports the following regular expression characters.

Format   Logic                            Example
-------- -------------------------------  -----------------------
value    Matches exact characters         "book" -match "oo"
anywhere in the original value.

.        Matches any single character.    "copy" -match "c..y"

[value]  Matches at least one of the      "big" -match "b[iou]g"
characters in the brackets.

[range]  Matches at least one of the      "and" -match "[a-e]nd"
characters within the range.
The use of a hyphen (-) allows
you to specify an adjacent
character.

[^]      Matches any characters except    "and" -match "[^brt]nd"
those in brackets.

^        Matches the beginning            "book" -match "^bo"
characters.

$        Matches the end characters.      "book" -match "ok$"

Matches any instances            "baggy" -match "g"
of the preceding character.

?        Matches zero or one instance     "baggy" -match "g?"
of the preceding character.

\        Matches the character that       "Try$" -match "Try\$"
follows as an escaped character.

Windows PowerShell supports the character classes available in
Microsoft .NET Framework regular expressions.

Format   Logic                            Example
-------- -------------------------------  -----------------------
\p{name} Matches any character in the     "abcd defg" -match "\p{Ll}+"
named character class specified
by {name}. Supported names are
Unicode groups and block
ranges such as Ll, Nd,
Z, IsGreek, and IsBoxDrawing.

\P{name} Matches text not included in     1234 -match "\P{Ll}+"
the groups and block ranges
specified in {name}.

\w       Matches any word character.      "abcd defg" -match "\w+"
Equivalent to the Unicode        (this matches abcd)
character categories [\p{Ll}
\p{Lu}\p{Lt}\p{Lo}\p{Nd}\p{Pc}].
If ECMAScript-compliant behavior
is specified with the ECMAScript
option, \w is equivalent to
[a-zA-Z_0-9].

\W       Matches any nonword character.   "abcd defg" -match "\W+"
Equivalent to the Unicode        (This matches the space)
categories [^\p{Ll}\p{Lu}\p{Lt}
\p{Lo}\p{Nd}\p{Pc}].

\s       Matches any white-space          "abcd defg" -match "\s+"
character.  Equivalent to the
Unicode character categories
[\f\n\r\t\v\x85\p{Z}].

\S       Matches any non-white-space      "abcd defg" -match "\S+"
character. Equivalent to the
Unicode character categories
[^\f\n\r\t\v\x85\p{Z}].

\d       Matches any decimal digit.       12345 -match "\d+"
Equivalent to \p{Nd} for
Unicode and [0-9] for non-
Unicode behavior.

\D       Matches any nondigit.            "abcd" -match "\D+"
Equivalent  to \P{Nd} for
Unicode and [^0-9] for non-
Unicode behavior.

Windows PowerShell supports the quantifiers available in .NET Framework
regular expressions. The following are some examples of quantifiers.

Format   Logic                            Example
-------- -------------------------------  -----------------------
Specifies zero or more matches;  "abc" -match "\w"
for example, \wor (abc).
Equivalent to {0,}.

+        Matches repeating instances of   "xyxyxy" -match "xy+"
the preceding characters.

?        Specifies zero or one matches;   "abc" -match "\w?"
for example, \w? or (abc)?.
Equivalent to {0,1}.

{n}      Specifies exactly n matches;     "abc" -match "\w{2}"
for example, (pizza){2}.

{n,}     Specifies at least n matches;    "abc" -match "\w{2,}"
for example, (abc){2,}.

{n,m}    Specifies at least n, but no     "abc" -match "\w{2,3}"
more than m, matches.

All the comparisons shown in the preceding table evaluate to true.

Notice that the escape character for regular expressions, a backslash (),
is different from the escape character for Windows PowerShell. The
escape character for Windows PowerShell is the backtick character (`)
# (ASCII 96).
