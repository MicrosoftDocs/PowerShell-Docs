# New-Service

## SYNOPSIS
Creates a new Windows service.

## SYNTAX

```
New-Service [-Name] <String> [-BinaryPathName] <String> [-DisplayName <String>] [-Description <String>]
 [-StartupType <ServiceStartMode>] [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-DependsOn <String[]>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The **New-Service** cmdlet creates a new entry for a Windows service in the registry and in the service database.
A new service requires an executable file that runs during the service.

The parameters of this cmdlet let you set the display name, description, startup type, and dependencies of the service.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Create a service

```
PS C:\> New-Service -Name "TestService" -BinaryPathName "C:\WINDOWS\System32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs"
```

This command creates a service named TestService.

### Example 2: Create a service that includes description, startup type, and display name

```
PS C:\> New-Service -Name "TestService" -BinaryPathName "C:\WINDOWS\System32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs" -DependsOn NetLogon -DisplayName "Test Service" -StartupType Manual -Description "This is a test service."
```

This command creates a service named TestService.
It uses the parameters of **New-Service** to specify a description, startup type, and display name for the new service.

### Example 3: View the new service

```
PS C:\> Get-WmiObject win32_service -Filter "name='testservice'"
ExitCode  : 0
Name      : testservice
ProcessId : 0
StartMode : Auto
State     : Stopped
Status    : OK
```

This command uses **Get-WmiObject** to get the **Win32_Service** object for the new service.
This object includes the start mode and the service description.

### Example 4: Delete a service

```
PS C:\> sc.exe delete TestService
- or -
PS C:\> (Get-WmiObject win32_service -Filter "name='TestService'").delete()
```

This example shows two ways to delete the TestService service.
The first command uses the delete option of Sc.exe.
The second command uses the **Delete** method of the Win32_Service objects that **Get-WmiObject** returns.
