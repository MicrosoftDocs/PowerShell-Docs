## DESCRIPTION

The `Get-Content` cmdlet gets the content of the item at the location specified by the path, such as the text in a file.
It reads the content one line at a time and returns a collection of objects, each of which represents a line of content.

Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, `Get-Content` can also get a specified number of lines from the beginning or end of an item.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get the content of a text file

```powershell
Get-Content -Path C:\Chapters\Chapter1.txt
```

This command gets the content of the Chapter1.txt file.
It uses the **Path** parameter to specify the name of the item.
`Get-Content` passes the content down the pipeline. Because there are no other pipeline elements, the content is formatted by default and displayed at the command line.

### Example 2: Get the first 50 lines from a text file and store the results in another file

```powershell
Get-Content c:\Logs\Log060912.txt -TotalCount 50 | Set-Content Sample.txt
```

This command gets the first 50 lines of the Log060912.txt file and stores them in the Sample.txt file.
The command uses the `Get-Content` cmdlet to get the text in the file.
(The name of **Path** parameter, which is optional, is omitted.) The **TotalCount** parameter limits the content retrieved to the first 50 lines.
The pipeline operator (|) sends the result to the `Set-Content` cmdlet, which places it in the Sample.txt file.

### Example 3: Get the fifth line of a text file

```powershell
(Get-Content Cmdlets.txt -TotalCount 5)[-1]
```

This command gets the fifth line of the Cmdlets.txt text file.
It uses the **TotalCount** parameter to get the first five lines and then uses array notation to get the last line (indicated by "-1") of the resulting set.

### Example 4: Get the first and last line of a text file

```powershell
Get-ChildItem .\*.txt | ForEach-Object {Get-Content $_ -TotalCount 1; Get-Content $_ -Tail 1}
```

This command gets the first and last lines of each text file in the current directory.
The command uses the **Tail** parameter and the **Head** alias of the **TotalCount** parameter

### Example 5: Get the content of an alternate data stream

This command uses the `-Stream` parameter to get the content of the `Zone.Identifier` alternate data stream.
The output includes Zone ID value of 3, which represents the internet.

```powershell
Get-Content .\Copy-Scripts.ps1 -Stream Zone.Identifier
```

```output
[ZoneTransfer]
ZoneId=3
```

### Example 6: Getting a hashtable out of file contents as a hastable

The commands in this example get the contents of a module manifest file (.psd1) as a hash table.
The manifest file contains a hash table, but if you get the contents without the `-Raw` dynamic parameter, it is returned as an array of newline-delimited strings.

```powershell
# First, use the -Path property of modules to get the path to the file that contains the module manifest for the PSScheduledJob module.
# Store the path in the Manifest variable.
$Manifest = (Get-Module -ListAvailable PSScheduledJob).Path
# Use the Invoke-Expression cmdlet to run a Get-Content command and the -Raw dynamic parameter of the  Get-Content cmdlet to get the contents of the module manifest file in a single string.
# Store the hashtable in the Hash variable.
$Hash = Invoke-Expression (Get-Content $Manifest -Raw)
# Return the contents of the hashtable as a collection of name-value pairs.
$Hash
```

```output

## PARAMETERS

### -Path

Specifies the path to an item.
`Get-Content` gets the content of the item.
Wildcards are permitted.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: Path
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -LiteralPath

Specifies the path to an item.
Unlike the **Path** parameter, the value of **LiteralPath** is used exactly as it is typed.
No characters are interpreted as wildcards.
If the path includes escape characters, enclose it in single quotation marks.
Single quotation marks tell Windows PowerShell not to interpret any characters as escape sequences.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: LiteralPath
Aliases: PSPath

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ReadCount

Specifies how many lines of content are sent through the pipeline at a time.
The default value is 1.
A value of 0 (zero) sends all of the content at one time.

This parameter does not change the content displayed, but it does affect the time it takes to display the content.
As the value of **ReadCount** increases, the time it takes to return the first line increases, but the total time for the operation decreases.
This can make a perceptible difference in large items.

```yaml
Type: Int64
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 1
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -TotalCount

Specifies the number of lines from the beginning of a file or other item.
The default is -1 (all lines).

You can use the "TotalCount" parameter name or its aliases, "First" or "Head".

```yaml
Type: Int64
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: First, Head

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: -1
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Tail

Specifies the number of lines from the end of a file or other item.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

You can use the **Tail** parameter name or its alias, **Last**.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: Last

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Filter

Specifies a filter in the provider's format or language.
The value of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter.
The syntax of the filter, including the use of wildcards, depends on the provider.
Filters are more efficient than other parameters, because the provider applies them when this cmdlet gets the objects, rather than having Windows PowerShell filter the objects after they are retrieved.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -Include

Specifies, as a string array, the item or items that this cmdlet includes in the operation.
The value of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter.
Enter a path element or pattern, such as *.txt.
Wildcards are permitted.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -Exclude

Specifies, as a string array, the item or items that this cmdlet omits when performing the operation.
The value of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter.
Enter a path element or pattern, such as *.txt.
Wildcards are permitted.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -Force

Overrides restrictions that prevent the command from succeeding, provided the changes do not compromise security.
For example, **Force** will override the read-only attribute or create directories to complete a file path, but it will not attempt to change file permissions.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential

Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
The default is the current user.

Type a user name, such as "User01" or "Domain01\User01", or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one generated by the `Get-Credential` cmdlet.
If you type a user name, you will be prompted for a password.

> [!WARNING]
> This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with Windows PowerShell.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Current user
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Delimiter

Specifies the delimiter that `Get-Content` uses to divide the file into objects while it reads. The default is "\n", the end-of-line character. When reading a text file, `Get-Content` returns a collection of string objects, each of which ends with an end-of-line character. When you enter a delimiter that does not exist in the file, `Get-Content` returns the entire file as a single, undelimited object.

You can use this parameter to split a large file into smaller files by specifying a file separator, as the delimiter. The delimiter is preserved (not discarded) and becomes the last item in each file section.

`-Delimiter` is a dynamic parameter that the FileSystem provider adds to the `Get-Content` cmdlet. This parameter works only in file system drives.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, when the value of the `-Delimiter` parameter is an empty string, `Get-Content` does not return anything. This is a known issue. To force `Get-Content` to return the entire file as a single, undelimited string, enter a value that does not exist in the file.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: End-of-line character
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Wait

Keeps the file open after all existing lines have been output. While waiting, `Get-Content` checks the file once each second and outputs new lines as they are appended. You can interrupt `-Wait` by pressing  CTRL+C.
Waiting also ends if the file gets deleted, in which case a non-terminating error is reported.

`-Wait` is a dynamic parameter that the FileSystem provider adds to the `Get-Content` cmdlet. This parameter works only in file system drives. `-Wait` cannot be combined with `-Raw`

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Raw

Ignores newline characters and returns the entire contents of a file in one string with the newlines preserved. By default, newline characters in a file are used as delimiters to separate the input into an array of strings.

`-Raw` is a dynamic parameter that the FileSystem provider adds to the `Get-Content` cmdlet. This parameter works only in file system drives.

This parameter is introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Encoding

Specifies the file encoding. The default is ASCII.

Valid values are:

- **ASCII**: Uses the encoding for the ASCII (7-bit) character set.
- **BigEndianUnicode**: Encodes in UTF-16 format using the big-endian byte order.
- **BigEndianUTF32**:  Encodes in UTF-32 format using the big-endian byte order.
- **Byte**:   Encodes a set of characters into a sequence of bytes.
- **String**:  Uses the encoding type for a string.
- **Unicode**:  Encodes in UTF-16 format using the little-endian byte order.
- **UTF7**:   Encodes in UTF-7 format.
- **UTF8**:  Encodes in UTF-8 format.
- **UTF32**:  Encodes in UTF-32 format.
- **Default**: Encodes in the default installed code page.
- **OEM**: Uses the default encoding for MS-DOS and console programs.
- **Unknown**:  The encoding type is unknown or invalid. The data can be treated as binary.

Encoding is a dynamic parameter that the FileSystem provider adds to the `Get-Content` cmdlet. This parameter works only in file system drives.

When reading from and writing to binary files, use a value of Byte for the Encoding dynamic parameter and a value of 0 for the ReadCount parameter.  A ReadCount value of 0 reads the entire file in a single read operation and converts it into a single object (PSObject).  The default ReadCount value, 1, reads one byte in each read operation and converts each byte into a separate object, which causes errors when you use the `Set-Content` cmdlet to write the bytes to a file. For more information, see the examples.

```yaml
Type: FileSystemCmdletProviderEncoding
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: Unknown, String, Unicode, Byte, BigEndianUnicode, UTF8, UTF7, UTF32, Ascii, Default, Oem

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: ASCII
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Stream

Gets the contents of the specified alternate NTFS file stream from the file. Enter the stream name. Wildcards are not supported.

Stream is a dynamic parameter that the FileSystem provider adds to the `Get-Content` cmdlet. This parameter works only in file system drives.

This parameter is introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UseTransaction

Includes the command in the active transaction.
This parameter is valid only when a transaction is in progress.
For more information, see about_Transactions.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: usetx

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
