# Set-Service

## SYNOPSIS
Starts, stops, and suspends a service, and changes its properties.

## SYNTAX

### Name (Default)
```
Set-Service [-ComputerName <String[]>] [-Name] <String> [-DisplayName <String>] [-Description <String>]
 [-StartupType <ServiceStartMode>] [-Status <String>] [-PassThru] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### InputObject
```
Set-Service [-ComputerName <String[]>] [-DisplayName <String>] [-Description <String>]
 [-StartupType <ServiceStartMode>] [-Status <String>] [-InputObject <ServiceController>] [-PassThru] [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Set-Service** cmdlet changes the properties of a local or remote service.
This includes the status, description, display name, and start mode.
You can use this cmdlet to start, stop, or suspend, or pause, a service.
To identify the service, enter its service name or submit a service object, or pipe a service name or service object to **Set-Service**.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Change a display name
```
PS C:\> Set-Service -Name "lanmanworkstation" -DisplayName "LanMan Workstation"
```

This command changes the display name of the lanmanworkstation service to LanMan Workstation.
The default is Workstation.

### Example 2: Change the startup type of services
```
PS C:\> Get-WMIObject win32_service -Filter "name = 'SysmonLog'"

ExitCode  : 0
Name      : SysmonLog
ProcessId : 0
StartMode : Manual
State     : Stopped
Status    : OK
PS C:\> Set-Service -Name "sysmonlog" -StartupType automatic
PS C:\> Get-WMIObject win32_service -Filter "name = 'SysmonLog'"
ExitCode  : 0
Name      : SysmonLog
ProcessId : 0
StartMode : Auto
State     : Stopped
Status    : OK

PS C:\> Get-WMIObject win32_service | Format-Table Name, StartMode -auto

Name                                  StartMode
----                                  ---------
AdtAgent                              Auto
Alerter                               Disabled
ALG                                   Manual
AppMgmt                               Manual
...
```

These commands get the startup type of the Performance Logs and Alerts (SysmonLog) service, set the start mode to automatic, and then display the result of the change.

These commands use the **Get-WmiObject** cmdlet to get the **Win32_Service** object for the service, because the **ServiceController** object that **Get-Service** returns does not include the start mode.

The first command uses the **Get-WmiObject** cmdlet to get the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) object that represents the **SysmonLog** service.
The default output of this command displays the start mode of the service.

The second command uses Set-Service to change the start mode to automatic.
Then, the first command is repeated to display the change.

The final command displays the start mode of all services on the computer.

### Example 3: Change the description of a service
```
PS C:\> Set-Service -Name "Schedule" -ComputerName "S1" -Description "Configures and schedules tasks."
PS C:\> Get-WMIObject win32_service -ComputerName "s1" | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "Schedule"} | Format-List Name, Description
```

These commands change the description of the Task Scheduler service on the S1 remote computer and then display the result.

These commands use the **Get-WmiObject** cmdlet to get the **Win32_Service** object for the service, because the **ServiceController** object that **Get-Service** returns does not include the service description.

The first command changes the description.
It identifies the service by using the service name of the service, Schedule.

The second command uses the **Get-WmiObject** cmdlet to get an instance of the WMI **Win32_Service** that represents the Task Scheduler service.
The first element in the command gets all instances of the **Win32_service** class.

The pipeline operator (|) passes the result to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects instances with a value of Schedule in the **Name** property.

Another pipeline operator sends the result to the Format-List cmdlet, which formats the output as a list that has only the **Name** and **Description** properties.

### Example 4: Start a service on a remote computer
```
PS C:\> Set-Service -Name "winrm" -Status Running -PassThru -ComputerName "Server02"
```

This command starts the WinRM service on the Server02 computer.
The command uses the Status parameter to specify the desired status, which is running, and the *PassThru* parameter to direct **Set-Service** to return an object that represents the WinRM service.

### Example 5: Suspend a service on remote computers
```
PS C:\> Get-Service -Name "schedule" -ComputerName "S1", "S2" | Set-Service -Status paused
```

This command suspends the Schedule service on the S1 and S2 remote computers.
It uses **Get-Service** to get the service.
A pipeline operator (|) sends the service to **Set-Service**, which changes its status to Paused.

### Example 6: Stop a service on the local computer
```
PS C:\> $S = Get-Service -Name "schedule"
PS C:\> Set-Service -InputObject $S -Status stopped
```

These commands stop the Schedule service on the local computer.

The first command uses **Get-Service** to get the Schedule service.
The command stores the service in the $s variable.

The second command changes the status of the Schedule service to Stopped.
It uses the *InputObject* parameter to submit the service stored in the $s variable, and it uses the *Status* parameter to specify the desired status.

## PARAMETERS

Specifies one or more computers.
The default is the local computer.

Type the NetBIOS name, an IP address, or a fully qualified domain name of a remote computer.
To specify the local computer, type the computer name, a dot (.), or localhost.

This parameter does not rely on Windows PowerShell remoting.
You can use the *ComputerName* parameter even if your computer is not configured to run remote commands.

This cmdlet does not return any objects.

## NOTES
* To use **Set-Service** on Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system, start Windows PowerShell by using the Run as administrator option.
* **Set-Service** can control services only when the current user has permission to do this. If a command does not work correctly, you might not have the required permissions.
* To find the service names and display names of the services on your system, type `Get-Service`. The service names appear in the **Name** column and the display names appear in the **DisplayName** column.
