# Write-Warning

## SYNOPSIS
Writes a warning message.

## SYNTAX

```
Write-Warning [-Message] <String> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Write-Warning** cmdlet writes a warning message to the PowerShell host.
The response to the warning depends on the value of the user's $WarningPreference variable and the use of the *WarningAction* common parameter.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Write a warning message
```
PS C:\> Write-Warning "This is only a test warning."
```

This command displays the message "WARNING: This is only a test warning."

### Example 2: Pass a string to Write-Warning
```
PS C:\> $w = "This is only a test warning."
PS C:\> $w | Write-Warning
```

This command shows that you can use a pipeline operator (|) to send a string to **Write-Warning**.
You can save the string in a variable, as shown in this command, or pipe the string directly to **Write-Warning**.

### Example 3: Set the $WarningPreference variable and write a warning
```
PS C:\> $warningpreference
Continue PS C:\> Write-Warning "This is only a test warning."
This is only a test warning. PS C:\> $warningpreference = "SilentlyContinue"
PS C:\> Write-Warning "This is only a test warning."
PS C:\>
PS C:\> $warningpreference = "Stop"
PS C:\> Write-Warning "This is only a test warning."
WARNING: This is only a test message.
Write-Warning : Command execution stopped because the shell variable "WarningPreference" is set to Stop.
At line:1 char:14
     + Write-Warning <<<<  "This is only a test message."
```

This example shows the effect of the value of the $WarningPreference variable on a **Write-Warning** command.

The first command displays the default value of the $WarningPreference variable, which is Continue.
As a result, when you write a warning, the warning message is displayed and execution continues.

When you change the value of the $WarningPreference variable, the effect of the **Write-Warning** command changes again.
A value of SilentlyContinue suppresses the warning.
A value of Stop displays the warning and then stops execution of the command.

For more information about the $WarningPreference variable, see about_Preference_Variables.

### Example 4: Set the WarningAction parameter and write a warning
```
PS C:\> Write-Warning "This is only a test warning." -WarningAction Inquire
WARNING: This is only a test warning.
Confirm
Continue with this operation?
 [Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [H] Halt Command  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"):
```

This example shows the effect of the *WarningAction* common parameter on a **Write-Warning** command.
You can use the *WarningAction* common parameter with any cmdlet to determine how PowerShell responds to warnings resulting from that command.
The *WarningAction* common parameter overrides the value of the $WarningPreference only for that particular command.

This command uses the **Write-Warning** cmdlet to display a warning.
The *WarningAction* common parameter with a value of Inquire directs the system to prompt the user when the command displays a warning.

For more information about the *WarningAction* common parameter, see about_CommonParameters.

## PARAMETERS


### -Message
Specifies the warning message.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: Msg

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### System.String
You can pipe a string that contains the warning to **Write-Warning**.

## OUTPUTS

### None
**Write-Warning** writes only to the warning stream.
It does not generate any other output.

## NOTES
* The default value for the $WarningPreference variable is Continue, which displays the warning and then continues executing the command. To determine valid values for a preference variable such as $WarningPreference, set it to a string of random characters, such as "abc". The resulting error message will list the valid values.
