# Get-PSBreakpoint

## SYNOPSIS
Gets the breakpoints that are set in the current session.

## SYNTAX

### Script (Default)
```
Get-PSBreakpoint [-Script <String[]>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Variable
```
Get-PSBreakpoint [-Script <String[]>] -Variable <String[]> [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Command
```
Get-PSBreakpoint [-Script <String[]>] -Command <String[]> [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Type
```
Get-PSBreakpoint [-Script <String[]>] [-Type] <BreakpointType[]> [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Id
```
Get-PSBreakpoint [-Id] <Int32[]> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-PSBreakPoint** cmdlet gets the breakpoints that are set in the current session.
You can use the cmdlet parameters to get particular breakpoints.

A breakpoint is a point in a command or script where execution stops temporarily so that you can examine the instructions.
**Get-PSBreakpoint** is one of several cmdlets designed for debugging PowerShell scripts and commands.
For more information about the PowerShell debugger, see about_Debuggers.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get all breakpoints for all scripts and functions
```
PS C:\> Get-PSBreakpoint
```

This command gets all breakpoints set on all scripts and functions in the current session.

### Example 2: Get breakpoints by ID
```
PS C:\> Get-PSBreakpoint -Id 2
Function   :
IncrementAction     :
Enabled    :
TrueHitCount   : 0
Id         : 2
Script     : C:\ps-test\sample.ps1
ScriptName : C:\ps-test\sample.ps1
```

This command gets the breakpoint with breakpoint ID 2.

### Example 3: Pipe an ID to Get-PSBreakpoint
```
PS C:\> $B = Set-PSBreakpoint -Script "sample.ps1" -Command "Increment"
PS C:\> $B.Id | Get-PSBreakpoint
```

These commands show how to get a breakpoint by piping a breakpoint ID to **Get-PSBreakpoint**.

The first command uses the Set-PSBreakpoint cmdlet to create a breakpoint on the Increment function in the Sample.ps1 script.
It saves the breakpoint object in the $B variable.

The second command uses the dot operator (.) to get the Id property of the breakpoint object in the $B variable.
It uses a pipeline operator (|) to send the ID to the **Get-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet.

As a result, **Get-PSBreakpoint** gets the breakpoint with the specified ID.

### Example 4: Get breakpoints in specified script files
```
PS C:\> Get-PSBreakpoint -Script "Sample.ps1, SupportScript.ps1"
```

This command gets all of the breakpoints in the Sample.ps1 and SupportScript.ps1 files.

This command does not get other breakpoints that might be set in other scripts or on functions in the session.

### Example 5: Get breakpoints in specified cmdlets
```
PS C:\> Get-PSBreakpoint -Command "Read-Host, Write-Host" -Script "Sample.ps1"
```

This command gets all Command breakpoints that are set on Read-Host or Write-Host commands in the Sample.ps1 file.

### Example 6: Get Command breakpoints in a specified file
```
PS C:\> Get-PSBreakpoint -Type Command -Script "Sample.ps1"
```

This command gets all Command breakpoints in the Sample.ps1 file.

### Example 7: Get breakpoints by variable
```
PS C:\> Get-PSBreakpoint -Variable "Index, Swap"
```

This command gets breakpoints that are set on the $Index and $Swap variables in the current session.

### Example 8: Get all Line and Variable breakpoints in a file
```
PS C:\> Get-PSBreakpoint -Type Line, Variable -Script "Sample.ps1"
```

This command gets all line and variable breakpoints in the Sample.ps1 script.
