# Disable-PSBreakpoint

## SYNOPSIS
Disables the breakpoints in the current console.

## SYNTAX

### Breakpoint (Default)
```
Disable-PSBreakpoint [-PassThru] [-Breakpoint] <Breakpoint[]> [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Id
```
Disable-PSBreakpoint [-PassThru] [-Id] <Int32[]> [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Disable-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet disables breakpoints, which assures that they are not hit when the script runs.
You can use it to disable all breakpoints, or you can specify breakpoints by submitting breakpoint objects or breakpoint IDs.

Technically, this cmdlet changes the value of the Enabled property of a breakpoint object to False.
To re-enable a breakpoint, use the Enable-PSBreakpoint cmdlet.
Breakpoints are enabled by default when you create them by using the Set-PSBreakpoint cmdlet.

A breakpoint is a point in a script where execution stops temporarily so that you can examine the instructions in the script.
**Disable-PSBreakpoint** is one of several cmdlets designed for debugging PowerShell scripts.
For more information about the PowerShell debugger, see about_Debuggers.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Set a breakpoint and disable it
```
PS C:\> $B = Set-PSBreakpoint -Script "sample.ps1" -Variable "name"
PS C:\> $B | Disable-PSBreakpoint
```

These commands disable a newly-created breakpoint.

The first command uses the Set-PSBreakpoint cmdlet to create a breakpoint on the *Name* variable in the Sample.ps1 script.
Then, it saves the breakpoint object in the $B variable.

The second command uses the **Disable-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet to disable the new breakpoint.
It uses a pipeline operator (|) to send the breakpoint object in $B to the **Disable-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet.

As a result of this command, the value of the Enabled property of the breakpoint object in $B is False.

### Example 2: Disable a breakpoint
```
PS C:\> Disable-PSBreakpoint -Id 0
```

This command disables the breakpoint with breakpoint ID 0.

### Example 3: Create a disabled breakpoint
```
PS C:\> Disable-PSBreakpoint -Breakpoint ($B = Set-PSBreakpoint -Script "sample.ps1" -Line 5)
PS C:\> $B
```

This command creates a new breakpoint that is disabled until you enable it.

It uses the **Disable-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet to disable the breakpoint.
The value of the *Breakpoint* parameter is a Set-PSBreakpoint command that sets a new breakpoint, generates a breakpoint object, and saves the object in the $B variable.

Cmdlet parameters that take objects as their values can accept a variable that contains the object or a command that gets or generates the object.
In this case, because **Set-PSBreakpoint** generates a breakpoint object, it can be used as the value of the *Breakpoint* parameter.

The second command displays the breakpoint object in the value of the $B variable.

### Example 4: Disable all breakpoints in the current console
```
PS C:\> Get-PSBreakpoint | Disable-PSBreakpoint
```

This command disables all breakpoints in the current console.
You can abbreviate this command as: "gbp | dbp".

## PARAMETERS

### -Breakpoint
Specifies the breakpoints to disable.
Enter a variable that contains breakpoint objects or a command that gets breakpoint objects, such as a Get-PSBreakpoint command.
You can also pipe breakpoint objects to the **Disable-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: Breakpoint[]
Parameter Sets: Breakpoint
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Id
Disables the breakpoints with the specified breakpoint IDs.
Enter the IDs or a variable that contains the IDs.
You cannot pipe IDs to **Disable-PSBreakpoint**.

```yaml
Type: Int32[]
Parameter Sets: Id
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PassThru
Returns an object representing the enabled breakpoints.
By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### System.Management.Automation.Breakpoint
You can pipe a breakpoint object to **Disable-PSBreakpoint**.

## OUTPUTS

### None or System.Management.Automation.Breakpoint
When you use the *PassThru* parameter, **Disable-PSBreakpoint** returns an object that represents the disabled breakpoint.
Otherwise, this cmdlet does not generate any output.
