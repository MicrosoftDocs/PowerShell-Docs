# New-Event

## SYNOPSIS
Creates a new event.

## SYNTAX

```
New-Event [-SourceIdentifier] <String> [[-Sender] <PSObject>] [[-EventArguments] <PSObject[]>]
 [[-MessageData] <PSObject>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **New-Event** cmdlet creates a new custom event.

You can use custom events to notify users about state changes in your program and any change that your program can detect, including hardware or system conditions, application status, disk status, network status, or the completion of a background job.

Custom events are automatically added to the event queue in your session whenever they are raised; you do not need to subscribe to them.
However, if you want to forward an event to the local session or specify an action to respond to the event, use the Register-EngineEvent cmdlet to subscribe to the custom event.

When you subscribe to a custom event, the event subscriber is added to your session.
If you cancel the event subscription by using the Unregister-Event cmdlet, the event subscriber and custom event are deleted from the session.
If you do not subscribe to the custom event, to delete the event, you must change the program conditions or close the PowerShell session.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Create a new event in the event queue
```
PS C:\> New-Event -SourceIdentifier Timer -Sender windows.timer -MessageData "Test"
```

This command creates a new event in the PowerShell event queue.
It uses a **Windows.Timer** object to send the event.

### Example 2: Raise an event in response to another event
```
PS C:\> function Enable-ProcessCreationEvent
{
   $Query = New-Object System.Management.WqlEventQuery "__InstanceCreationEvent", (New-Object TimeSpan 0,0,1), "TargetInstance isa 'Win32_Process'"
   $ProcessWatcher = New-Object System.Management.ManagementEventWatcher $Query
   $Identifier = "WMI.ProcessCreated"
   Register-ObjectEvent $ProcessWatcher "EventArrived" -SupportEvent $Identifier -Action
   {
      [void] (New-Event -SourceID "PowerShell.ProcessCreated" -Sender $Args[0] -EventArguments $Args[1].SourceEventArgs.NewEvent.TargetInstance)
   }
}
```

This sample function uses the **New-Event** cmdlet to raise an event in response to another event.
The command uses the Register-ObjectEvent cmdlet to subscribe to the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event that is raised when a new process is created.
The command uses the *Action* parameter of the cmdlet to call the **New-Event** cmdlet, which creates the new event.

Because the events that **New-Event** raises are automatically added to the PowerShell event queue, you do not need to register for that event.
