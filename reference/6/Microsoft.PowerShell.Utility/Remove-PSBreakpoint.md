# Remove-PSBreakpoint

## SYNOPSIS
Deletes breakpoints from the current console.

## SYNTAX

### Breakpoint (Default)
```
Remove-PSBreakpoint [-Breakpoint] <Breakpoint[]> [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Id
```
Remove-PSBreakpoint [-Id] <Int32[]> [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Remove-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet deletes a breakpoint.
Enter a breakpoint object or a breakpoint ID.

When you remove a breakpoint, the breakpoint object is no longer available or functional.
If you have saved a breakpoint object in a variable, the reference still exists, but the breakpoint does not function.

**Remove-PSBreakpoint** is one of several cmdlets designed for debugging PowerShell scripts.
For more information about the PowerShell debugger, see about_Debuggers.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Remove all breakpoints
```
PS C:\> Get-PSBreakpoint | Remove-PSBreakpoint
```

This command deletes all of the breakpoints in the current console.

### Example 2: Remove a specified breakpoint
```
PS C:\> $B = Set-PSBreakpoint -Script "sample.ps1" -Variable "Name"
PS C:\> $B | Remove-PSBreakpoint
```

This command deletes a breakpoint.

The first command uses the Set-PSBreakpoint cmdlet to create a breakpoint on the Name variable in the Sample.ps1 script.
Then, it saves the breakpoint object in the $B variable.

The second command uses the **Remove-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet to delete the new breakpoint.
It uses a pipeline operator (|) to send the breakpoint object in the $B variable to the **Remove-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet.

As a result of this command, if you run the script, it runs to completion without stopping.
Also, the **Get-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet does not return this breakpoint.

### Example 3: Remove a breakpoint by ID
```
PS C:\> Remove-PSBreakpoint -Id 2
```

This command deletes the breakpoint with breakpoint ID 2.

### Example 4: Use a function to remove all breakpoints
```
PS C:\> function del-psb { get-psbreakpoint | remove-psbreakpoint }
```

This simple function deletes all of the breakpoints in the current console.
It uses the Get-PSBreakpoint cmdlet to get the breakpoints.
Then, it uses a pipeline operator (|) to send the breakpoints to the **Remove-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet, which deletes them.

As a result, you can type `del-psb` instead of the longer command.

To save the function, add it to your PowerShell profile.
