# Set-ExecutionPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
Sets the PowerShell execution policies for Windows computers.

## SYNTAX

### All

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy [-ExecutionPolicy] <ExecutionPolicy> [[-Scope] <ExecutionPolicyScope>] [-Force]
[-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet changes PowerShell execution policies for Windows computers. For
more information, see [about_Execution_Policies](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/about/about_Execution_Policies.md).

For non-Windows computers, the default execution policy is **Unrestricted** and cannot be changed.
The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet is available, but PowerShell displays a console message that it's
not supported.

An execution policy is part of the PowerShell security strategy. Execution policies determine
whether you can load configuration files, such as your PowerShell profile, or run scripts. And,
whether scripts must be digitally signed before they are run.

The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet's default scope is **LocalMachine**, which affects everyone who
uses the computer. To change the execution policy for **LocalMachine**, start PowerShell with **Run
as Administrator**.

To display the execution policies for each scope in the order of precedence, use
`Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`. To see the effective execution policy for your PowerShell session use
`Get-ExecutionPolicy` with no parameters.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Set an execution policy

This example shows how to set the execution policy for the local computer.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
```

```Output
        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process       Undefined
  CurrentUser    RemoteSigned
 LocalMachine    RemoteSigned
```

The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the
**RemoteSigned** policy. The **Scope** parameter specifies the default scope value,
**LocalMachine**. To view the execution policy settings, use the `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet with
the **List** parameter.

### Example 2: Set an execution policy that conflicts with a Group Policy

This command attempts to set the **LocalMachine** scope's execution policy to **Restricted**.
**LocalMachine** is more restrictive, but isn't the effective policy because it conflicts with a
Group Policy. The **Restricted** policy is written to the registry hive **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE**.

```
PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope LocalMachine

Set-ExecutionPolicy : PowerShell updated your local preference successfully, but the setting is
overridden by the Group Policy applied to your system. Due to the override, your shell will retain
its current effective execution policy of "AllSigned". Contact your Group Policy administrator for
more information. At line:1 char:20 + Set-ExecutionPolicy <<<< restricted

PS> Get-ChildItem -Path HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds

    Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds

Name                    Property
----                    --------
Microsoft.PowerShell    Path            : C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
                        ExecutionPolicy : Restricted
ScriptedDiagnostics     ExecutionPolicy : Unrestricted
```

The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the
**Restricted** policy. The **Scope** parameter specifies the default scope value, **LocalMachine**.
The `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet uses the **Path** parameter with the **HKLM** provider to specify
registry location.

### Example 3: Apply the execution policy from a remote computer to a local computer

This command gets the execution policy object from a remote computer and sets the policy on the
local computer. `Get-ExecutionPolicy` sends a **Microsoft.PowerShell.ExecutionPolicy** object down
the pipeline. `Set-ExecutionPolicy` accepts pipeline input and doesn't require the
**ExecutionPolicy** parameter.

```
PS> Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server01 -ScriptBlock { Get-ExecutionPolicy } | Set-ExecutionPolicy
```

The `Invoke-Command` cmdlet is executed at the local computer and sends the **ScriptBlock** to the
remote computer. The **ComputerName** parameter specifies the remote computer, **Server01**. The
**ScriptBlock** parameter runs `Get-ExecutionPolicy` on the remote computer. The
`Get-ExecutionPolicy` object is sent down the pipeline to the `Set-ExecutionPolicy`.
`Set-ExecutionPolicy` applies the execution policy to the local computer's default scope,
**LocalMachine**.

### Example 4: Set the scope for an execution policy

This example shows how to set an execution policy for a specified scope, **CurrentUser**. The
**CurrentUser** scope only affects the user who sets this scope.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Scope CurrentUser
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
```

```Output
        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process       Undefined
  CurrentUser       AllSigned
 LocalMachine    RemoteSigned
```

`Set-ExecutionPolicy` uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the **AllSigned** policy.
The **Scope** parameter specifies the **CurrentUser**. To view the execution policy settings, use
the `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet with the **List** parameter.

The effective execution policy for the user becomes **AllSigned**.

### Example 5: Remove the execution policy for the current user

This example shows how use the **Undefined** execution policy to remove an execution policy for a
specified scope.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Undefined -Scope CurrentUser
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
```

```Output
        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process       Undefined
  CurrentUser       Undefined
 LocalMachine    RemoteSigned
```

`Set-ExecutionPolicy` uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the **Undefined** policy.
The **Scope** parameter specifies the **CurrentUser**. To view the execution policy settings, use
the `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet with the **List** parameter.

### Example 6: Set the execution policy for the current PowerShell session

The **Process** scope only affects the current PowerShell session. The execution policy is saved in
the environment variable `$env:PSExecutionPolicyPreference` and is deleted when the session is
closed.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Scope Process
```

```Output
        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process       AllSigned
  CurrentUser    RemoteSigned
 LocalMachine    RemoteSigned
```

The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the **AllSigned**
policy. The **Scope** parameter specifies the value **Process**. To view the execution policy
settings, use the `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet with the **List** parameter.

### Example 7: Unblock a script to run it without changing the execution policy

This example shows how the **RemoteSigned** execution policy prevents you from running unsigned
scripts.

A best practice is to read the script's code and verify it's safe **before** using the
`Unblock-File` cmdlet. The `Unblock-File` cmdlet unblocks scripts so they can run, but doesn't
change the execution policy.

```
PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine

PS> Get-ExecutionPolicy

RemoteSigned

PS> .\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1

.\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 : File .\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 cannot be loaded.
The file .\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 is not digitally signed.
The script will not execute on the system.
For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
At line:1 char:1
+ .\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], PSSecurityException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess

PS> Unblock-File -Path .\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1

PS> Get-ExecutionPolicy

RemoteSigned

PS> .\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1

Task 1:
```

The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the **RemoteSigned**
policy. The policy is set for the default scope, **LocalMachine**.

The `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet shows that **RemoteSigned** is the effective execution policy for
the current PowerShell session.

The **Start-ActivityTracker.ps1** script is executed from the current directory. The script is
blocked by **RemoteSigned** because the script isn't digitally signed.

For this example, the script's code was reviewed and verified as safe to run. The `Unblock-File`
cmdlet uses the **Path** parameter to unblock the script.

To verify that `Unblock-File` didn't change the execution policy, `Get-ExecutionPolicy` displays the
effective execution policy, **RemoteSigned**.

The script, **Start-ActivityTracker.ps1** is executed from the current directory. The script begins
to run because it was unblocked by the `Unblock-File` cmdlet.

## PARAMETERS

### -ExecutionPolicy

Specifies the execution policy. If there are no Group Policies and each scope's execution policy is
set to **Undefined**, then **Restricted** becomes the effective policy for all users.

The acceptable execution policy values are as follows:

- **AllSigned**. Requires that all scripts and configuration files are signed by a trusted
  publisher, including scripts written on the local computer.
- **Bypass**. Nothing is blocked and there are no warnings or prompts.
- **Default**. Sets the default execution policy. **Restricted** for Windows clients or
  **RemoteSigned** for Windows servers.
- **RemoteSigned**. Requires that all scripts and configuration files downloaded from the Internet
  are signed by a trusted publisher. The default execution policy for Windows server computers.
- **Restricted**. Doesn't load configuration files or run scripts. The default execution policy
  Windows client computers.
- **Undefined**. No execution policy is set for the scope. Removes an assigned execution policy from
  a scope that is not set by a Group Policy. If the execution policy in all scopes is **Undefined**,
  the effective execution policy is **Restricted**.
- **Unrestricted**. Loads all configuration files and runs all scripts. If you run an unsigned
  script that was downloaded from the Internet, you are prompted for permission before it runs. The
  default execution policy for non-Windows computers and cannot be changed.

```yaml
Type: ExecutionPolicy
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: AllSigned, Bypass, Default, RemoteSigned, Restricted, Undefined, Unrestricted

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force

Suppresses all the confirmation prompts. Use caution with this parameter to avoid unexpected
results.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Scope

Specifies the scope that is affected by an execution policy. The default scope is **LocalMachine**.

The effective execution policy is determined by the order of precedence as follows:

- **MachinePolicy**. Set by a Group Policy for all users of the computer.
- **UserPolicy**. Set by a Group Policy for the current user of the computer.
- **Process**. Affects only the current PowerShell session.
- **CurrentUser**. Affects only the current user.
- **LocalMachine**. Default scope that affects all users of the computer.

The **Process** scope only affects the current PowerShell session. The execution policy is saved in
the environment variable `$env:PSExecutionPolicyPreference`, rather than the registry. When the
PowerShell session is closed, the variable and value are deleted.

Execution policies for the **CurrentUser** scope are written to the registry hive
**HKEY_LOCAL_USER**.

Execution policies for the **LocalMachine** scope are written to the registry hive
**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE**.

```yaml
Type: ExecutionPolicyScope
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: CurrentUser, LocalMachine, MachinePolicy, Process, UserPolicy

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: LocalMachine
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs. The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable,
-InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose,
-WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### Microsoft.PowerShell.ExecutionPolicy, System.String

You can pipe an execution policy object or a string that contains the name of an execution policy to
`Set-ExecutionPolicy`.

## OUTPUTS

### None

`Set-ExecutionPolicy` doesn't return any output.

## NOTES

`Set-ExecutionPolicy` doesn't change the **MachinePolicy** and **UserPolicy** scopes because they
are set by Group Policies.

`Set-ExecutionPolicy` doesn't override a Group Policy, even if the user preference is more
restrictive than the policy.

If the Group Policy **Turn on Script Execution** is enabled for the computer or user, the user
preference is saved, but it is not effective. PowerShell displays a message that explains the
conflict.
