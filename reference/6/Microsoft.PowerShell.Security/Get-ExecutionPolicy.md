# Get-ExecutionPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
Gets the execution policies for the current session.

## SYNTAX

### All

```
Get-ExecutionPolicy [[-Scope] <ExecutionPolicyScope>] [-List] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

To display the execution policies for each scope in the order of precedence, use
`Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`. To see the effective execution policy for your PowerShell session use
`Get-ExecutionPolicy` with no parameters.

The effective execution policy is determined by execution policies that are set by
`Set-ExecutionPolicy` and Group Policy settings.

For more information, see [about_Execution_Policies](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/about/about_Execution_Policies.md).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get all execution policies

This command displays the execution policies for each scope in the order of precedence.

```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
```

```Output
Scope          ExecutionPolicy
-----          ---------------
MachinePolicy  Undefined
UserPolicy     Undefined
Process        Undefined
CurrentUser    AllSigned
LocalMachine   Undefined
```

The `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet uses the **List** parameter to display each scope's execution
policy.

### Example 2: Set an execution policy

This example shows how to set an execution policy for the local computer.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
```

```Output
        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process       Undefined
  CurrentUser       AllSigned
 LocalMachine    RemoteSigned
```

The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the
**RemoteSigned** policy. The **Scope** parameter specifies the default scope value,
**LocalMachine**. To view the execution policy settings, use the `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet with
the **List** parameter.

### Example 3: Get the effective execution policy

This example shows how to display the effective execution policy for a PowerShell session.

```
PS> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process       Undefined
  CurrentUser       AllSigned
 LocalMachine    RemoteSigned

PS> Get-ExecutionPolicy

AllSigned
```

The `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet uses the **List** parameter to display each scope's execution
policy. The `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet is run without a parameter to display the effective
execution policy, **AllSigned**.

### Example 4: Unblock a script to run it without changing the execution policy

This example shows how the **RemoteSigned** execution policy prevents you from running unsigned
scripts.

A best practice is to read the script's code and verify it's safe **before** using the
`Unblock-File` cmdlet. The `Unblock-File` cmdlet unblocks scripts so they can run, but doesn't
change the execution policy.

```
PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine

PS> Get-ExecutionPolicy

RemoteSigned

PS> .\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1

.\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 : File .\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 cannot be loaded.
The file .\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 is not digitally signed.
The script will not execute on the system.
For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
At line:1 char:1
+ .\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], PSSecurityException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess

PS> Unblock-File -Path .\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1

PS> Get-ExecutionPolicy

RemoteSigned

PS> .\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1

Task 1:
```

The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the **RemoteSigned**
policy. The policy is set for the default scope, **LocalMachine**.

The `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet shows that **RemoteSigned** is the effective execution policy for
the current PowerShell session.

The **Start-ActivityTracker.ps1** script is executed from the current directory. The script is
blocked by **RemoteSigned** because the script isn't digitally signed.

For this example, the script's code was reviewed and verified as safe to run. The `Unblock-File`
cmdlet uses the **Path** parameter to unblock the script.

To verify that `Unblock-File` didn't change the execution policy, `Get-ExecutionPolicy` displays the
effective execution policy, **RemoteSigned**.

The script, **Start-ActivityTracker.ps1** is executed from the current directory. The script begins
to run because it was unblocked by the `Unblock-File` cmdlet.

## PARAMETERS

### -List

Gets all execution policy values for the session listed in precedence order. By default,
`Get-ExecutionPolicy` gets only the effective execution policy.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Scope

Specifies the scope that is affected by an execution policy.

The effective execution policy is determined by the order of precedence as follows:

- **MachinePolicy**. Set by a Group Policy for all users of the computer.
- **UserPolicy**. Set by a Group Policy for the current user of the computer.
- **Process**. Affects only the current PowerShell session.
- **CurrentUser**. Affects only the current user.
- **LocalMachine**. Default scope that affects all users of the computer.

```yaml
Type: ExecutionPolicyScope
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: CurrentUser, LocalMachine, MachinePolicy, Process, UserPolicy

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: Effective execution policy
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable,
-InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose,
-WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### None

`Get-ExecutionPolicy` doesn't accept input from the pipeline.

## OUTPUTS

### Microsoft.PowerShell.ExecutionPolicy

## NOTES

An execution policy is part of the PowerShell security strategy. Execution policies determine
whether you can load configuration files, such as your PowerShell profile, or run scripts. And,
whether scripts must be digitally signed before they are run.
