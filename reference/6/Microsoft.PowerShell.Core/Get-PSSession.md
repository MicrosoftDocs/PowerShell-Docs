## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-PSSession** cmdlet gets the user-managed PowerShell sessions (**PSSessions**) on local and remote computers.

Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, sessions are stored on the computers at the remote end of each connection.
You can use the *ComputerName* or *ConnectionUri* parameters of **Get-PSSession** to get the sessions that connect to the local computer or remote computers, even if they were not created in the current session.

Without parameters, **Get-PSSession** gets all sessions that were created in the current session.

Use the filtering parameters, including *Name*, *ID*, *InstanceID*, *State*, *ApplicationName*, and *ConfigurationName* to select from among the sessions that **Get-PSSession** returns.

Use the remaining parameters to configure the temporary connection in which the **Get-PSSession** command runs when you use the *ComputerName* or *ConnectionUri* parameters.

NOTE: In Windows PowerShell 2.0, without parameters, **Get-PSSession** gets all sessions that were created in the current session.
The *ComputerName* parameter gets sessions that were created in the current session and connect to the specified computer.

For more information about PowerShell sessions, see about_PSSessions (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135181).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get sessions created in the current session
```
PS C:\> Get-PSSession
```

This command gets all of the **PSSessions** that were created in the current session.
It does not get **PSSessions** that were created in other sessions or on other computers, even if they connect to this computer.

### Example 2: Get sessions connected to the local computer
```
PS C:\> Get-PSSession -ComputerName "localhost"
```

This command gets the **PSSessions** that are connected to the local computer.
To indicate the local computer, type the computer name, localhost, or a dot (.)

The command returns all of the sessions on the local computer, even if they were created in different sessions or on different computers.

### Example 3: Get sessions connected to a computer
```
PS C:\> Get-PSSession -ComputerName "Server02"
 Id Name            ComputerName    State         ConfigurationName     Availability
 -- ----            ------------    -----         -----------------     ------------
  2 Session3        Server02       Disconnected  ITTasks                       Busy
  1 ScheduledJobs   Server02       Opened        Microsoft.PowerShell     Available
  3 Test            Server02       Disconnected  Microsoft.PowerShell          Busy
```

This command gets the **PSSessions** that are connected to the Server02 computer.

The command returns all of the sessions on Server02, even if they were created in different sessions or on different computers.

The output shows that two of the sessions have a Disconnected state and a Busy availability.
They were created in different sessions and are currently in use.
The ScheduledJobs session, which is Opened and Available, was created in the current session.

### Example 4: Save results of this command
```
PS C:\> New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01, Server02, Server03
PS C:\> $s1, $s2, $s3 = Get-PSSession
```

This example shows how to save the results of a **Get-PSSession** command in multiple variables.

The first command uses the **New-PSSession** cmdlet to create **PSSessions** on three remote computers.

The second command uses a **Get-PSSession** cmdlet to get the three **PSSessions**.
It then saves each of the **PSSessions** in a separate variable.

When PowerShell assigns an array of objects to an array of variables, it assigns the first object to the first variable, the second object to the second variable, and so on.
If there are more objects than variables, it assigns all remaining objects to the last variable in the array.
If there are more variables than objects, the extra variables are not used.

### Example 5: Delete a session by using an instance ID
```
PS C:\> Get-PSSession | Format-Table -Property ComputerName, InstanceID
PS C:\> $s = Get-PSSession -InstanceID a786be29-a6bb-40da-80fb-782c67f7db0f
PS C:\> Remove-PSSession -Session $s
```

This example shows how to get a **PSSession** by using its instance ID, and then to delete the **PSSession**.

The first command gets all of the **PSSessions** that were created in the current session.
It sends the **PSSessions** to the Format-Table cmdlet, which displays the **ComputerName** and **InstanceID** properties of each **PSSession**.

The second command uses the **Get-PSSession** cmdlet to get a particular **PSSession** and to save it in the $s variable.
The command uses the **InstanceID** parameter to identify the **PSSession**.

The third command uses the Remove-PSSession cmdlet to delete the **PSSession** in the $s variable.

### Example 6: Get a session that has a particular name
```
The first command gets sessions on the Server02 and Server12 remote computers that have names that begin with BackupJob and use the ITTasks session configuration.The command uses the *Name* parameter to specify the name pattern and the *ConfigurationName* parameter to specify the session configuration. The value of the *SessionOption* parameter is a hash table that sets the value of the *OperationTimeout* to 240000 milliseconds (4 minutes). This setting gives the command more time to complete.The *ConfigurationName* and *SessionOption* parameters are used to configure the temporary sessions in which the **Get-PSSession** cmdlet runs on each computer.The output shows that the command returns the BackupJob04 session. The session is disconnected and the *Availability* is None, which indicates that it is not in use.
PS C:\> Get-PSSession -ComputerName Server02, Server12 -Name BackupJob* -ConfigurationName ITTasks -SessionOption @{OperationTimeout=240000}
 Id Name            ComputerName    State         ConfigurationName     Availability
 -- ----            ------------    -----         -----------------     ------------
  3 BackupJob04     Server02        Disconnected        ITTasks                  None

The second command uses the **Get-PSSession** cmdlet to get to the BackupJob04 session and the Connect-PSSession cmdlet to connect to the session. The command saves the session in the $s variable.
PS C:\> $s = Get-PSSession -ComputerName Server02 -Name BackupJob04 -ConfigurationName ITTasks | Connect-PSSession

The third command gets the session in the $s variable. The output shows that the **Connect-PSSession** command was successful. The session is in the **Opened** state and is available for use.
PS C:\> $s
Id Name            ComputerName    State         ConfigurationName     Availability
-- ----            ------------    -----         -----------------     ------------
 5 BackupJob04     Server02        Opened        ITTasks                  Available
```

The commands in this example find a session that has a particular name format and uses a particular session configuration and then connect to the session.
You can use a command like this one to find a session in which a colleague started a task and connect to finish the task.

### Example 7: Get a session by using its ID
```
PS C:\> Get-PSSession -Id 2
```

This command gets the **PSSession** with ID 2.
Because the value of the **ID** property is unique only in the current session, the *Id* parameter is valid only for local commands.

## PARAMETERS

### -AllowRedirection
Indicates that this cmdlet allows redirection of this connection to an alternate Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
By default, PowerShell does not redirect connections.

This parameter configures the temporary connection that is created to run a **Get-PSSession** command with the *ConnectionUri* parameter.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: ConnectionUriInstanceId, ConnectionUri
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ApplicationName
Specifies the name of an application.
This cmdlet connects only to sessions that use the specified application.

Enter the application name segment of the connection URI.
For example, in the following connection URI, the application name is WSMan: `http://localhost:5985/WSMAN`.
The application name of a session is stored in the **Runspace.ConnectionInfo.AppName** property of the session.

The value of this parameter is used to select and filter sessions.
It does not change the application that the session uses.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, ComputerInstanceId
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Authentication
Specifies the mechanism that is used to authenticate credentials for the session in which the **Get-PSSession** command runs.

This parameter configures the temporary connection that is created to run a **Get-PSSession** command with the *ComputerName* or *ConnectionUri* parameter.

The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- Default
- Basic
- Credssp
- Digest
- Kerberos
- Negotiate
- NegotiateWithImplicitCredential.

The default value is Default.

For more information about the values of this parameter, see [AuthenticationMechanism Enumeration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.runspaces.authenticationmechanism) in the MSDN library.

CAUTION: Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) authentication, in which the user's credentials are passed to a remote computer to be authenticated, is designed for commands that require authentication on more than one resource, such as accessing a remote network share.
This mechanism increases the security risk of the remote operation.
If the remote computer is compromised, the credentials that are passed to it can be used to control the network session.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: AuthenticationMechanism
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, ComputerInstanceId, ConnectionUriInstanceId, ConnectionUri
Aliases:
Accepted values: Default, Basic, Negotiate, NegotiateWithImplicitCredential, Credssp, Digest, Kerberos

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CertificateThumbprint
Specifies the digital public key certificate (X509) of a user account that has permission to create the session in which the **Get-PSSession** command runs.
Enter the certificate thumbprint of the certificate.

This parameter configures the temporary connection that is created to run a **Get-PSSession** command with the *ComputerName* or *ConnectionUri* parameter.

Certificates are used in client certificate-based authentication.
They can be mapped only to local user accounts; they do not work with domain accounts.

To get a certificate thumbprint, use a Get-Item or Get-ChildItem command in the PowerShell Cert: drive.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, ComputerInstanceId, ConnectionUriInstanceId, ConnectionUri
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ComputerName
Specifies an array of names of computers.
Gets the sessions that connect to the specified computers.
Wildcard characters are not permitted.
There is no default value.

Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, **PSSession** objects are stored on the computers at the remote end of each connection.
To get the sessions on the specified computers, PowerShell creates a temporary connection to each computer and runs a **Get-PSSession** command.

Type the NetBIOS name, an IP address, or a fully-qualified domain name of one or more computers.
To specify the local computer, type the computer name, localhost, or a dot (.).

Note: This parameter gets sessions only from computers that run Windows PowerShell 3.0 or later versions of PowerShell.
Earlier versions do not store sessions.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, ComputerInstanceId
Aliases: Cn

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ConfigurationName
Specifies the name of a configuration.
This cmdlet gets only to sessions that use the specified session configuration.

Enter a configuration name or the fully qualified resource URI for a session configuration.
If you specify only the configuration name, the following schema URI is prepended: http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell.
The configuration name of a session is stored in the **ConfigurationName** property of the session.

The value of this parameter is used to select and filter sessions.
It does not change the session configuration that the session uses.

For more information about session configurations, see about_Session_Configurations.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, ComputerInstanceId, ConnectionUriInstanceId, ConnectionUri, VMIdInstanceId, ContainerId, ContainerIdInstanceId, VMId, VMName, VMNameInstanceId
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ConnectionUri
Specifies a URI that defines the connection endpoint for the temporary session in which the **Get-PSSession** command runs.
The URI must be fully qualified.

This parameter configures the temporary connection that is created to run a **Get-PSSession** command with the *ConnectionUri* parameter.

The format of this string is:

\<Transport\>://\<ComputerName\>:\<Port\>/\<ApplicationName\>

The default value is: http://localhost:5985/WSMAN.

If you do not specify a *ConnectionUri*, you can use the *UseSSL*, *ComputerName*, *Port*, and *ApplicationName* parameters to specify the *ConnectionURI* values.
Valid values for the Transport segment of the URI are HTTP and HTTPS.
If you specify a connection URI with a Transport segment, but do not specify a port, the session is created with standards ports: 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.
To use the default ports for PowerShell remoting, specify port 5985 for HTTP or 5986 for HTTPS.

If the destination computer redirects the connection to a different URI, PowerShell prevents the redirection unless you use the *AllowRedirection* parameter in the command.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

This parameter gets sessions only from computers that run Windows PowerShell 3.0 or later versions of Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core.
Earlier versions do not store sessions.

```yaml
Type: Uri[]
Parameter Sets: ConnectionUriInstanceId, ConnectionUri
Aliases: URI, CU

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential
Specifies a user credential.
This cmdlet runs the command with the permissions of the specified user.
Specify a user account that has permission to connect to the remote computer and run a **Get-PSSession** command.
The default is the current user.
Type a user name, such as `User01`, `Domain01\User01`, or `User@Domain.com`, or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one returned by the Get-Credential cmdlet.
When you type a user name, this cmdlet prompts you for a password.

This parameter configures to the temporary connection that is created to run a **Get-PSSession** command with the *ComputerName* or *ConnectionUri* parameter.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, ComputerInstanceId, ConnectionUriInstanceId, ConnectionUri
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Id
Specifies an array of session IDs.
This cmdlet gets only the sessions with the specified IDs.
Type one or more IDs, separated by commas, or use the range operator (..) to specify a range of IDs.
You cannot use the ID parameter together with the *ComputerName* parameter.

An ID is an integer that uniquely identifies the user-managed sessions in the current session.
It is easier to remember and type than the *InstanceId*, but it is unique only within the current session.
The ID of a session is stored in the ID property of the session.

```yaml
Type: Int32[]
Parameter Sets: Id
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InstanceId
Specifies an array of instance IDs of sessions.
This cmdlet gets only the sessions with the specified instance IDs.

The instance ID is a GUID that uniquely identifies a session on a local or remote computer.
The **InstanceID** is unique, even when you have multiple sessions running in PowerShell.

The instance ID of a session is stored in the **InstanceID** property of the session.

```yaml
Type: Guid[]
Parameter Sets: ComputerInstanceId, ConnectionUriInstanceId, VMIdInstanceId, ContainerIdInstanceId, VMNameInstanceId
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

```yaml
Type: Guid[]
Parameter Sets: InstanceId
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
Specifies an array of session names.
This cmdlet gets only the sessions that have the specified friendly names.
Wildcard characters are permitted.

The friendly name of a session is stored in the **Name** property of the session.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: Name
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, ConnectionUri, ContainerId, VMId, VMName
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Port
Specifies the specified network port that is used for the temporary connection in which the **Get-PSSession** command runs.
To connect to a remote computer, the remote computer must be listening on the port that the connection uses.
The default ports are 5985, which is the WinRM port for HTTP, and 5986, which is the WinRM port for HTTPS.

Before using an alternate port, you must configure the WinRM listener on the remote computer to listen at that port.
To configure the listener, type the following two commands at the PowerShell prompt:

`Remove-Item -Path WSMan:\Localhost\listener\listener* -Recurse`

`New-Item -Path WSMan:\Localhost\listener -Transport http -Address * -Port \<port-number\>`

This parameter configures to the temporary connection that is created to run a **Get-PSSession** command with the *ComputerName* or *ConnectionUri* parameter.

Do not use the *Port* parameter unless you must.
The **Port** set in the command applies to all computers or sessions on which the command runs.
An alternate port setting might prevent the command from running on all computers.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, ComputerInstanceId
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SessionOption
Specifies advanced options for the session.
Enter a **SessionOption** object, such as one that you create by using the New-PSSessionOption cmdlet, or a hash table in which the keys are session option names and the values are session option values.

The default values for the options are determined by the value of the $PSSessionOption preference variable, if it is set.
Otherwise, the default values are established by options set in the session configuration.

The session option values take precedence over default values for sessions set in the $PSSessionOption preference variable and in the session configuration.
However, they do not take precedence over maximum values, quotas or limits set in the session configuration.

For a description of the session options, including the default values, see New-PSSessionOption.
For information about the $PSSessionOption preference variable, see [about_Preference_Variables](About/about_Preference_Variables.md) in the Microsoft TechNet library.
For more information about session configurations, see about_Session_Configurations (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=145152).

```yaml
Type: PSSessionOption
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, ComputerInstanceId, ConnectionUriInstanceId, ConnectionUri
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -State
Specifies a session state.
This cmdlet gets only sessions in the specified state.
The acceptable values for this parameter are: All, Opened, Disconnected, Closed, and Broken.
The default value is All.

The session state value is relative to the current sessions.
Sessions that were not created in the current sessions and are not connected to the current session have a state of Disconnected even when they are connected to a different session.

The state of a session is stored in the **State** property of the session.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SessionFilterState
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, ComputerInstanceId, ConnectionUriInstanceId, ConnectionUri, VMIdInstanceId, ContainerId, ContainerIdInstanceId, VMId, VMName, VMNameInstanceId
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ThrottleLimit
Specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections that can be established to run the **Get-PSSession** command.
If you omit this parameter or enter a value of 0 (zero), the default value, 32, is used.
The throttle limit applies only to the current command, not to the session or to the computer.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, ComputerInstanceId, ConnectionUriInstanceId, ConnectionUri
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UseSSL
Indicates that this cmdlet uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to establish the connection in which the **Get-PSSession** command runs.
By default, SSL is not used.
If you use this parameter, but SSL is not available on the port used for the command, the command fails.

This parameter configures the temporary connection that is created to run a **Get-PSSession** command with the *ComputerName* parameter.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

## OUTPUTS

### System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.PSSession

## NOTES
* This cmdlet gets user-managed sessions **PSSession** objects" such as those that are created by using the New-PSSession, **Enter-PSSession**, and Invoke-Command cmdlets. It does not get the system-managed session that is created when you start PowerShell.
* Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, **PSSession** objects are stored on the computer that is at the server-side or receiving end of a connection. To get the sessions that are stored on the local computer or a remote computer, PowerShell establishes a temporary session to the specified computer and runs query commands in the session.
* To get sessions that connect to a remote computer, use the *ComputerName* or *ConnectionUri* parameters to specify the remote computer. To filter the sessions that **Get-PSSession** gets, use the *Name*, *ID*, *InstanceID*, and *State* parameters. Use the remaining parameters to configure the temporary session that **Get-PSSession** uses.
* When you use the *ComputerName* or *ConnectionUri* parameters, **Get-PSSession** gets only sessions from computers running Windows PowerShell 3.0 and later versions of PowerShell.
* The value of the **State** property of a **PSSession** is relative to the current session. Therefore, a value of **Disconnected** means that the **PSSession** is not connected to the current session. However, it does not mean that the **PSSession** is disconnected from all sessions. It might be connected to a different session. To determine whether you can connect or reconnect to the **PSSession** from the current session, use the **Availability** property.

  An **Availability** value of **None** indicates that you can connect to the session.
A value of **Busy** indicates that you cannot connect to the **PSSession** because it is connected to another session.

  For more information about the values of the **State** property of sessions, see [RunspaceState Enumeration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.runspaces.runspacestate) in the MSDN library.

  For more information about the values of the **Availability** property of sessions, see [RunspaceAvailability Enumeration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.runspaces.runspaceavailability) in the MSDN library.
