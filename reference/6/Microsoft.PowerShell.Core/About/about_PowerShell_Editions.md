# About PowerShell Editions

## Short Description
Different editions of PowerShell run on different underlying runtimes.

## Long Description

From PowerShell 5.1, there are multiple *editions* of PowerShell that each run on
a different .NET runtime. As of PowerShell 6.2 there are two editions of PowerShell:

- **Desktop**, which runs on .NET Framework. PowerShell 4 and below, as well as
  PowerShell 5.1 on full-featured Windows editions like Windows Desktop, Windows Server,
  Windows Server Core and most other Windows operating systems are Desktop edition.
  This is the original PowerShell edition.
- **Core**, which runs on .NET Core. PowerShell 6.0 and above, as well as PowerShell 5.1 on
  some reduced-footprint Windows editions such as Windows Nano Server and Windows IoT where
  .NET Framework is unavailable.

Because the edition of PowerShell corresponds to its .NET runtime, it is the primary indicator
of .NET API and PowerShell module compatibility; some .NET APIs, types or methods are not available
in both .NET runtimes and this affects PowerShell scripts and modules that depend on them.

## The `$PSEdition` automatic variable

In PowerShell 5.1 and above, you can find out what edition you are running with the `$PSEdition`
automatic variable:

```powershell
$PSEdition
```

```Output
Core
```

In PowerShell 4 and below, this variable does not exist. `$PSEdition` being null should be treated
as the same as having the value `Desktop`.

### Edition in `$PSVersionTable`

The `$PSVersionTable` automatic variable also has edition information in PowerShell 5.1 and above:

```powershell
$PSVersionTable
```

```Output
Name                           Value
----                           -----
PSVersion                      6.2.0-rc.1
PSEdition                      Core           # <-- Edition information
GitCommitId                    6.2.0-rc.1
OS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18865
Platform                       Win32NT
PSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}
PSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3
SerializationVersion           1.1.0.1
WSManStackVersion              3.0
```

The `PSEdition` field will have the same value as the `$PSEdition` automatic variable.

## The `CompatiblePSEditions` module manifest field

PowerShell modules can declare what editions of PowerShell they are compatible with using the
`CompatiblePSEditions` field of the module manifest.

For example, a module manifest declaring compatibility with both `Desktop` and `Core` editions
of PowerShell:

```powershell
@{
    ModuleVersion = '1.0'
    FunctionsToExport = @('Test-MyModule')
    CompatiblePSEditions = @('Desktop', 'Core')
}
```

An example of a module manifest with only `Desktop` compatibility:

```powershell
@{
    ModuleVersion = '1.0'
    FunctionsToExport = @('Test-MyModule')
    CompatiblePSEditions = @('Desktop')
}
```

Omitting the `CompatiblePSEditions` field from a module manifest will have the same effect as
setting it to `Desktop`, since modules created before this field was introduced were implicitly
written for this edition.

For modules not shipped as part of Windows (i.e. modules you write or install from the gallery),
this field is informational only; PowerShell does not change behavior based on the
`CompatiblePSEditions` field, but does expose it on the `PSModuleInfo` object (returned by
`Get-Module`) for your own logic:

```powershell
New-ModuleManifest -Path .\TestModuleWithEdition.psd1 -CompatiblePSEditions Desktop,Core -PowerShellVersion '5.1'
$ModuleInfo = Test-ModuleManifest -Path .\TestModuleWithEdition.psd1
$ModuleInfo.CompatiblePSEditions
```

```Output
Desktop
Core
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `CompatiblePSEditions` module field is only compatible with PowerShell 5.1 and above.
> Including this field will cause a module to be incompatible with PowerShell 4 and below.
> Since the field is purely informational, it can be safely omitted in later PowerShell versions.

In PowerShell 6.1, `Get-Module -ListAvailable` has had its formatter updated to display the
edition-compatibility of each module:

```PowerShell
Get-Module -ListAvailable
```

```Output

    Directory: C:\Users\me\Documents\PowerShell\Modules

## Edition-compatibility for modules that ship as part of Windows

For modules that come as part of Windows (or are installed as part of a role or feature),
PowerShell 6.1 and above treat the `CompatiblePSEditions` field differently. Such modules are found
in the Windows PowerShell system modules directory
(`%windir%\System\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules`).

For modules loaded from or found in this directory, PowerShell 6.1 and above uses the
`CompatiblePSEditions` field to determine whether the module will be compatible with the current
session and behaves accordingly.

When `Import-Module` is used, a module without `Core` in `CompatiblePSEditions` will not be imported
and an error will be displayed:

```powershell
Import-Module BitsTransfer
```

```Output
Import-Module : Module 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\BitsTransfer\BitsTransfer.psd1' does not support current PowerShell edition 'Core'. Its supported editions are 'Desktop'. Use 'Import-Module -SkipEditionCheck' to ignore the compatibility of this module.
At line:1 char:1
+ Import-Module BitsTransfer
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ CategoryInfo          : ResourceUnavailable: (C:\WINDOWS\system32\u2026r\BitsTransfer.psd1:String) [Import-Module], InvalidOperationException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : Modules_PSEditionNotSupported,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.ImportModuleCommand
```

When `Get-Module -ListAvailable` is used, modules without `Core` in `CompatiblePSEditions` will not
be displayed:

```powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable BitsTransfer
```

```Output
# No output
```

In both cases, the `-SkipEditionCheck` switch parameter can be used to override this behavior:

```powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable -SkipEditionCheck BitsTransfer
```

```Output

    Directory: C:\WINDOWS\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules

ModuleType Version    Name                                PSEdition ExportedCommands
---------- -------    ----                                --------- ----------------
Manifest   2.0.0.0    BitsTransfer                        Desk      {Add-BitsFile, Complete-BitsTransfer, Get-BitsTransfer,...

```

> [!WARNING]
> `Import-Module -SkipEditionCheck` may appear to succeed for a module, but using that module
> runs the risk of encountering an incompatibility later on; while loading the module initially
> succeeds, a command may later call an incompatible API and fail spontaneously.

## Authoring PowerShell modules for edition cross-compatibility

When writing a PowerShell module to target both `Desktop` and `Core` editions of PowerShell,
there are things you can do to ensure cross-edition compatibility.

The only true way to confirm and continually validate compatibility however is to write tests for
your script or module and run them on all versions and editions of PowerShell you need compatibility
with. A recommended testing framework for this is [Pester][].

### PowerShell script

As a language, PowerShell works the same between editions; it is the cmdlets, modules and .NET APIs
you use that are affected by edition compatibility.

Generally, scripts that work in PowerShell 6.1 and above will work with Windows PowerShell 5.1,
but there are some exceptions.

Version 1.18.0 [PSScriptAnalyzer][] module has rules like [`PSUseCompatibleCommands`][] and
[`PSUseCompatibleTypes`][] that are able to detect possibly incompatible usage of commands
and .NET APIs in PowerShell scripts.

### .NET assemblies

If you are writing a binary module or a module that incorporates .NET assemblies (DLLs) generated
from source code, you should compile against [.NET Standard][] and [PowerShell Standard][]
for compile-time compatibility validation of .NET and PowerShell API compatibility.

Although these libraries are able to check some compatibility at compile time, they won't be able
to catch possible behavioral differences between editions. For this you must still write tests.
