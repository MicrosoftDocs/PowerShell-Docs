# About Automatic Variables

## SHORT DESCRIPTION

Describes variables that store state information for PowerShell. These
variables are created and maintained by PowerShell.

## LONG DESCRIPTION

Conceptually, these variables are considered to be read-only.
Even though they **can** be written to, for backward compatibility they **should not** be written to.

Here is a list of the automatic variables in  PowerShell:

### $$

Contains the last token in the last line received by the session.

### $?

Contains the execution status of the last operation. It contains TRUE if
the last operation succeeded and FALSE if it failed.

### $^

Contains the first token in the last line received by the session.

### $_

Same as $PSItem. Contains the current object in the pipeline object. You
can use this variable in commands that perform an action on every object or
on selected objects in a pipeline.

### $ARGS

Contains an array of the undeclared parameters and\/or parameter values
that are passed to a function, script, or script block. When you create a
function, you can declare the parameters by using the param keyword or by
adding a comma-separated list of parameters in parentheses after the
function name.

In an event action, the $Args variable contains objects that represent the
event arguments of the event that is being processed. This variable is
populated only within the Action block of an event registration command.
The value of this variable can also be found in the SourceArgs property of
the PSEventArgs object (System.Management.Automation.PSEventArgs) that
Get-Event returns.

### $CONSOLEFILENAME

Contains the path of the console file (.psc1) that was most recently used
in the session. This variable is populated when you start PowerShell with
the PSConsoleFile parameter or when you use the Export-Console cmdlet to
export snap-in names to a console file.

When you use the Export-Console cmdlet without parameters, it automatically
updates the console file that was most recently used in the session. You
can use this automatic variable to determine which file will be updated.

### $ERROR

Contains an array of error objects that represent the most recent errors.
The most recent error is the first error object in the array ($Error[0]).

To prevent an error from being added to the $Error array, use the
ErrorAction common parameter with a value of Ignore. For more information,
see [about_CommonParameters](about_CommonParameters.md).

### $EVENT

Contains a PSEventArgs object that represents the event that is being
processed. This variable is populated only within the Action block of an
event registration command, such as Register-ObjectEvent. The value of this
variable is the same object that the Get-Event cmdlet returns. Therefore,
you can use the properties of the $Event variable, such as
$Event.TimeGenerated , in an Action script block.

### $EVENTARGS

Contains an object that represents the first event argument that derives
from EventArgs of the event that is being processed. This variable is
populated only within the Action block of an event registration command.
The value of this variable can also be found in the SourceEventArgs
property of the PSEventArgs (System.Management.Automation.PSEventArgs)
object that Get-Event returns.

### $EVENTSUBSCRIBER

Contains a PSEventSubscriber object that represents the event subscriber of
the event that is being processed. This variable is populated only within
the Action block of an event registration command. The value of this
variable is the same object that the Get-EventSubscriber cmdlet returns.

### $EXECUTIONCONTEXT

Contains an EngineIntrinsics object that represents the execution context
of the PowerShell host. You can use this variable to find the execution
objects that are available to cmdlets.

### $FALSE

Contains FALSE. You can use this variable to represent FALSE in commands
and scripts instead of using the string "false". The string can be
interpreted as TRUE if it is converted to a non-empty string or to a
non-zero integer.

### $FOREACH

Contains the enumerator (not the resulting values) of a ForEach loop. You
can use the properties and methods of enumerators on the value of the
$ForEach variable. This variable exists only while the ForEach loop is
running; it is deleted after the loop is completed. For detailed
information, see [about_ForEach](about_ForEach.md).

### $HOME

Contains the full path of the user's home directory. This variable is the
equivalent of the `%homedrive%%homepath%` Windows environment variables,
typically C:\\Users\\<UserName>.

### $HOST

Contains an object that represents the current host application for
PowerShell. You can use this variable to represent the current host in
commands or to display or change the properties of the host, such as
$Host.version or $Host.CurrentCulture, or
$host.ui.rawui.setbackgroundcolor("Red").

### $INPUT

Contains an enumerator that enumerates all input that is passed to a
function. The $input variable is available only to functions and script
blocks (which are unnamed functions). In the Process block of a function,
the $input variable enumerates the object that is currently in the
pipeline. When the Process block completes, there are no objects left in
the pipeline, so the $input variable enumerates an empty collection. If the
function does not have a Process block, then in the End block, the $input
variable enumerates the collection of all input to the function.

### $IsCoreCLR

Contains $TRUE if the current session is running on the .NET Core Runtime 
(CoreCLR). Otherwise contains $FALSE.

### $IsLinux

Contains $TRUE if the current session is running on a Linux operating system.
Otherwise contains $FALSE.

### $IsMacOS

Contains $TRUE if the current session is running on a MacOS operating system.
Otherwise contains $FALSE.

### $IsWindows

Contains $TRUE if the current session is running on a Windows operationg system.
Otherwise contains $FALSE.

### $LASTEXITCODE

Contains the exit code of the last Windows-based program that was run.

### $MATCHES

The $Matches variable works with the `-match` and `-notmatch` operators.
When you submit scalar input to the `-match` or `-notmatch` operator, and
either one detects a match, they return a Boolean value and populate the
$Matches automatic variable with a hash table of any string values that
were matched. For more information about the -match operator, see
[about_comparison_operators](about_comparison_operators.md).

### $MyInvocation

Contains an information about the current command, such as the name,
parameters, parameter values, and information about how the command was
started, called, or "invoked," such as the name of the script that called
the current command.

\$MyInvocation is populated only for scripts, function, and script blocks.
You can use the information in the System.Management.Automation.InvocationInfo
object that \$MyInvocation returns in the current script, such as the path and
file name of the script (\$MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path) or the name of a
function (\$MyInvocation.MyCommand.Name) to identify the current command. This
is particularly useful for finding the name of the current script.

Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, $MyInvocation has the following new
properties.

| Property      | Description                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| PSScriptRoot  | Contains the full path to the script that invoked   |
|               | the current command. The value of this property is  |
|               | populated only when the caller is a script.         |
| PSCommandPath | Contains the full path and file name of the script  |
|               | that invoked the current command. The value of this |
|               | property is populated only when the caller is a     |
|               | script.                                             |

Unlike the $PSScriptRoot and $PSCommandPath automatic variables, the
PSScriptRoot and PSCommandPath properties of the $MyInvocation automatic
variable contain information about the invoker or calling script, not the
current script.

### $NestedPromptLevel

Contains the current prompt level. A value of 0 indicates the original
prompt level. The value is incremented when you enter a nested level and
decremented when you exit it.

For example, PowerShell presents a nested command prompt when you use the
$Host.EnterNestedPrompt method. PowerShell also presents a nested command
prompt when you reach a breakpoint in the PowerShell debugger.

When you enter a nested prompt, PowerShell pauses the current command,
saves the execution context, and increments the value of the
$NestedPromptLevel variable. To create additional nested command prompts
(up to 128 levels) or to return to the original command prompt, complete
the command, or type "exit".

The $NestedPromptLevel variable helps you track the prompt level. You can
create an alternative PowerShell command prompt that includes this value so
that it is always visible.

### $null

$null is an automatic variable that contains a NULL or empty value. You can
use this variable to represent an absent or undefined value in commands and
scripts.

PowerShell treats $null as an object with a value, that is, as an explicit
placeholder, so you can use $null to represent an empty value in a series
of values.

For example, when $null is included in a collection, it is counted as one
of the objects.

```powershell
$a = "one", $null, "three"
$a.count
```

```output
3
```

If you pipe the $null variable to the ForEach-Object cmdlet, it generates a
value for $null, just as it does for the other objects

```powershell
"one", $null, "three" | ForEach-Object { "Hello " + $_}
```

```output
Hello one
Hello
Hello three
```

As a result, you cannot use $null to mean "no parameter value." A parameter
value of $null overrides the default parameter value.

However, because PowerShell treats the $null variable as a placeholder, you
can use it in scripts like the following one, which would not work if $null
were ignored.

```powershell
$calendar = @($null, $null, “Meeting”, $null, $null, “Team Lunch”, $null)
$days = "Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday",
        "Friday","Saturday"
$currentDay = 0
foreach($day in $calendar)
{
    if($day -ne $null)
    {
        "Appointment on $($days[$currentDay]): $day"
    }

    $currentDay++
}
```

```output
Appointment on Tuesday: Meeting
Appointment on Friday: Team lunch
```

### $PID

Contains the process identifier (PID) of the process that is hosting the
current PowerShell session.

### $PROFILE

Contains the full path of the PowerShell profile for the current user and
the current host application. You can use this variable to represent the
profile in commands. For example, you can use it in a command to determine
whether a profile has been created:

```powershell
test-path $profile
```

Or, you can use it in a command to create a profile:

```powershell
new-item -type file -path $pshome -force
```

You can also use it in a command to open the profile in Notepad:

```
notepad $profile
```

### $PSBoundParameters

Contains a dictionary of the parameters that are passed to a script or
function and their current values. This variable has a value only in a
scope where parameters are declared, such as a script or function. You can
use it to display or change the current values of parameters or to pass
parameter values to another script or function.

For example:

```powershell
function Test {
   param($a, $b)

   # Display the parameters in dictionary format.
   $PSBoundParameters

   # Call the Test1 function with $a and $b.
   test1 @PSBoundParameters
}
```

### $PSCMDLET

Contains an object that represents the cmdlet or advanced function that is
being run.

You can use the properties and methods of the object in your cmdlet or
function code to respond to the conditions of use. For example, the
ParameterSetName property contains the name of the parameter set that is
being used, and the ShouldProcess method adds the WhatIf and Confirm
parameters to the cmdlet dynamically.

For more information about the $PSCmdlet automatic variable, see
[about_Functions_Advanced](about_Functions_Advanced.md).

### $PSCommandPath

Contains the full path and file name of the script that is being run. This
variable is valid in all scripts.

### $PSCulture

Contains the name of the culture currently in use in the operating system.
The culture determines the display format of items such as numbers,
currency, and dates. This is the value of the
System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Name property of the
system. To get the System.Globalization.CultureInfo object for the system,
use the Get-Culture cmdlet.

### $PSDEBUGCONTEXT

While debugging, this variable contains information about the debugging
environment. Otherwise, it contains a NULL value. As a result, you can use
it to indicate whether the debugger has control. When populated, it
contains a PsDebugContext object that has Breakpoints and InvocationInfo
properties. The InvocationInfo property has several useful properties,
including the Location property. The Location property indicates the path
of the script that is being debugged.

### $PSHOME

Contains the full path of the installation directory for PowerShell,
typically, `%windir%\System32\PowerShell\v1.0` in Windows systems. You can
use this variable in the paths of PowerShell files. For example, the
following command searches the conceptual Help topics for the word
"variable":

```powershell
Select-String -Pattern Variable -Path $pshome\*.txt
```

### $PSITEM

Same as $_. Contains the current object in the pipeline object. You can use
this variable in commands that perform an action on every object or on
selected objects in a pipeline.

### $PSScriptRoot

Contains the directory from which a script is being run.

In PowerShell 2.0, this variable is valid only in script modules (.psm1).
Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, it is valid in all scripts.

### $PSSENDERINFO

Contains information about the user who started the PSSession, including
the user identity and the time zone of the originating computer. This
variable is available only in PSSessions.

The $PSSenderInfo variable includes a user-configurable property,
ApplicationArguments, which, by default, contains only the $PSVersionTable
from the originating session. To add data to the ApplicationArguments
property, use the ApplicationArguments parameter of the New-PSSessionOption
cmdlet.

### $PSUICulture

Contains the name of the user interface (UI) culture that is currently in
use in the operating system. The UI culture determines which text strings
are used for user interface elements, such as menus and messages. This is
the value of the System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture.Name
property of the system. To get the System.Globalization.CultureInfo object
for the system, use the Get-UICulture cmdlet.

### $PSVersionTable

Contains a read-only hash table that displays details about the version of
PowerShell that is running in the current session. The table includes the
following items:

| Property                  | Description                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |

| GitCommitId               | The commit Id of the source files, in GitHub, |
|                           | used in this version of PowerShell            |
| OS                        | Description of the operating system that      |
|                           | PowerShell is running on.                     |
| Platform                  | Platform that the operating system is running |
|                           | on.                                           |
| PSCompatibleVersions      | Versions of PowerShell that are compatible    |
|                           | with the current version                      |
| PSEdition                 | This property has the value of 'Desktop', for |
|                           | Windows Server and Windows client versions.   |
|                           | This property has the value of 'Core' for     |
|                           | PowerShell running under Nano Server or       |
|                           | Windows IOT.                                  |
| PSRemotingProtocolVersion | The version of the PowerShell remote          |
|                           | management protocol.                          |
| PSVersion                 | The PowerShell version number                 |
| SerializationVersion      | The version of the serialization method       |
| WSManStackVersion         | The version number of the WS-Management stack |

### $PWD

Contains a path object that represents the full path of the current
directory.

### REPORTERRORSHOW VARIABLES

The "ReportErrorShow" variables are defined in PowerShell, but they are not
implemented. Get-Variable gets them, but they do not contain valid data.

- $REPORTERRORSHOWEXCEPTIONCLASS
- $REPORTERRORSHOWINNEREXCEPTION
- $REPORTERRORSHOWSOURCE
- $REPORTERRORSHOWSTACKTRACE

### $SENDER

Contains the object that generated this event. This variable is populated
only within the Action block of an event registration command. The value of
this variable can also be found in the Sender property of the PSEventArgs
(System.Management.Automation.PSEventArgs) object that Get-Event returns.

### $ShellId

Contains the identifier of the current shell.

### $StackTrace
Contains a stack trace for the most recent error.

### $THIS

In a script block that defines a script property or script method, the
$This variable refers to the object that is being extended.

### $true

Contains TRUE. You can use this variable to represent TRUE in commands and
scripts.
