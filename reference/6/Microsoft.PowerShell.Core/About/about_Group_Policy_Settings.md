# About Group Policy Settings

## SHORT DESCRIPTION

Describes the Group Policy settings for PowerShell

## LONG DESCRIPTION

PowerShell includes Group Policy settings to help you define
consistent option values for servers in an enterprise environment.

The PowerShell Group Policy settings are in the following
Group Policy paths:

    Computer Configuration\
      Administrative Templates\
        Windows Components\
          Windows PowerShell

    User Configuration\
      Administrative Templates\
        Windows Components\
          Windows PowerShell

Group policy settings in the User Configuration path take precedence
over Group Policy settings in the Computer Configuration path.

The policies are as follows:

- Turn on Script Execution: Sets the Windows PowerShell execution policy.
- Turn on Module Logging: Sets the **LogPipelineExecutionDetails** property of
  modules.
- Set the default source path for `Update-Help`: Sets the source for
  Updatable Help to a directory, not the Internet.

To download spreadsheets that list all of the Group Policy settings for
each version of Windows, see
[Group Policy Settings Reference for Windows and Windows Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=261775)
in the Microsoft Download Center.

## TURN ON SCRIPT EXECUTION

The "Turn on Script Execution" policy setting sets the execution policy
for computers and users, which determines which scripts are permitted to
run.

If you enable the policy setting, you can select from among the following
policy settings.

- "Allow only signed scripts" allows scripts to execute only if they are
  signed by a trusted publisher. This policy setting is equivalent to the
  AllSigned execution policy.

- "Allow local scripts and remote signed scripts" allows all local scripts to
  run. Scripts that originate from the Internet must be signed by a trusted
  publisher. This policy setting is equivalent to the RemoteSigned execution
  policy.

- "Allow all scripts" allows all scripts to run. This policy setting is
  equivalent to the Unrestricted execution policy.

If you disable this policy setting, no scripts are allowed to run. This policy
setting is equivalent to the Restricted execution policy.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the execution policy
that is set for the computer or user by the `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet
determines whether scripts are permitted to run. The default value is
Restricted.

For more information, see [about_Execution_Policies](about_Execution_Policies.md).

## TURN ON MODULE LOGGING

The "Turn on Module Logging" policy setting turns on logging for
selected PowerShell modules. The setting is effective in
all sessions on all affected computers.

If you enable this policy setting and specify one or more modules,
pipeline execution events for the specified modules are recorded in
the Windows PowerShell log in Event Viewer.

If you disable this policy setting, logging of execution events is
disabled for all PowerShell modules.

If this policy setting is not configured, the **LogPipelineExecutionDetails**
property of each module or snap-in determines whether the execution
events of a module or snap-in are logged. By default, the
**LogPipelineExecutionDetails** property of all modules and snap-ins is set
to False.

To turn on module logging for a module, use the following command format.
The module must be imported into the session and the setting is effective
only in the current session.

```powershell
Import-Module <Module-Name>
(Get-Module <Module-Name>).LogPipelineExecutionDetails = $true
```

To turn on module logging for all sessions on a particular computer,
add the previous commands to the 'All Users' PowerShell profile
($Profile.AllUsersAllHosts).

For more information about module logging, see [about_Modules](about_Modules.md).

## SET THE DEFAULT SOURCE PATH FOR UPDATE-HELP

The "Set the Default Source Path for Update-Help" policy setting sets a
default value for the **SourcePath** parameter of the `Update-Help` cmdlet. This
setting prevents users from using the `Update-Help` cmdlet to download help
files from the Internet.

NOTE: The "Set the default source path for Update-Help" Group Policy setting
appears under 'Computer Configuration' and 'User Configuration'. However, only
the Group Policy setting under 'Computer Configuration' is effective. The Group
Policy setting under 'User Configuration' is ignored.

The `Update-Help` cmdlet downloads and installs the newest help files for
PowerShell modules and installs them on the computer. By default,
`Update-Help` downloads new help files from an Internet location specified by
the module.

However, you can use the `Save-Help` cmdlet to download the newest help files to
a file system location, such as a network share, and then use the `Update-Help`
cmdlet to get the help files from the file system location and install them on
the computer. The **SourcePath** parameter of the `Update-Help` cmdlet specifies
the file system location.

By providing a default value for the **SourcePath** parameter, this Group Policy
setting implicitly adds the **SourcePath** parameter to all `Update-Help`
commands.
Users can override the particular file system location specified as the
default value by entering a different file system location. But they cannot
remove the **SourcePath** parameter from the `Update-Help` command.

If you enable this policy setting, you can specify a default value for the
**SourcePath** parameter. Enter a file system location.

If this policy setting is disabled or not configured, there is no default
value for the **SourcePath** parameter of the `Update-Help` cmdlet. Users can
download help from the Internet or from any file system location.
