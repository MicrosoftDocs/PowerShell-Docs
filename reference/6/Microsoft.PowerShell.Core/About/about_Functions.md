# About Functions

# SHORT DESCRIPTION

Describes how to create and use functions in PowerShell.

# LONG DESCRIPTION

A function is a list of PowerShell statements that has a name that you
assign. When you run a function, you type the function name. The statements in
the list run as if you had typed them at the command prompt.

Functions can be as simple as:

```powershell
function Get-PowerShellProcess {Get-Process PowerShell}
```

or as complex as a cmdlet or an application program.

Like cmdlets, functions can have parameters. The parameters can be named,
positional, switch, or dynamic parameters. Function parameters can be read
from the command line or from the pipeline.

Functions can return values that can be displayed, assigned to variables, or
passed to other functions or cmdlets.

The function's statement list can contain different types of statement lists
with the keywords Begin, Process, and End. These statement lists handle input
from the pipeline differently.

A filter is a special kind of function that uses the Filter keyword.

Functions can also act like cmdlets. You can create a function that works
just like a cmdlet without using C# programming. For more information,
see [about_Functions_Advanced](about_Functions_Advanced.md).

### Syntax

The following is the syntax for a function:

```powershell
function [<scope:>]<name> [([type]$parameter1[,[type]$parameter2])]
{
  param([type]$parameter1 [,[type]$parameter2])
  dynamicparam {<statement list>}
  begin {<statement list>}
  process {<statement list>}
  end {<statement list>}
}
```

A function includes the following items:

- A Function keyword
- A scope (optional)
- A name that you select
- Any number of named parameters (optional)
- One or more PowerShell commands enclosed in braces ({})

For more information about the Dynamicparam keyword and dynamic parameters in
functions, see
[about_Functions_Advanced_Parameters](about_Functions_Advanced_Parameters.md).

### Simple Functions

Functions do not have to be complicated to be useful. The simplest functions
have the following format:

```powershell
function <function-name> {statements}
```

For example, the following function starts PowerShell with the Run as
Administrator option.

```powershell
function Start-PSAdmin {Start-Process PowerShell -Verb RunAs}
```

To use the function, type: `Start-PSAdmin`

To add statements to the function, use a semi-colon (;) to separate the
statements, or type each statement on a separate line.

For example, the following function finds all .jpg files in the current user's
directories that were changed after the start date.

```powershell
function Get-NewPix
{
  $start = Get-Date -Month 1 -Day 1 -Year 2010
  $allpix = Get-ChildItem -Path $env:UserProfile\*.jpg -Recurse
  $allpix | where {$_.LastWriteTime -gt $Start}
}
```

You can create a toolbox of useful small functions. Add these functions to
your PowerShell profile, as described in about_Profiles and later in
this topic.

### Function Names

You can assign any name to a function, but functions that you share with
others should follow the naming rules that have been established for all
PowerShell commands.

Functions names should consist of a verb-noun pair in which the verb
identifies the action that the function performs and the noun identifies the
item on which the cmdlet performs its action.

Functions should use the standard verbs that have been approved for all
PowerShell commands. These verbs help us to keep our command names
simple, consistent, and easy for users to understand.

For more information about the standard PowerShell verbs, see
[Cmdlet Verbs](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160773) on MSDN.

### Functions with Parameters

You can use parameters with functions, including named parameters, positional
parameters, switch parameters, and dynamic parameters. For more information
about dynamic parameters in functions, see
[about_Functions_Advanced_Parameters](about_Functions_Advanced_Parameters.md).

### Named Parameters

You can define any number of named parameters. You can include a default value
for named parameters, as described later in this topic.

You can define parameters inside the braces using the Param keyword, as shown
in the following sample syntax:

```powershell
function <name> {
  param ([type]$parameter1[,[type]$parameter2])
  <statement list>
}
```

You can also define parameters outside the braces without the Param keyword,
as shown in the following sample syntax:

```powershell
function <name> [([type]$parameter1[,[type]$parameter2])] {
  <statement list>
}
```

There is no difference between these two methods. Use the method that you
prefer.

When you run the function, the value you supply for a parameter is assigned to
a variable that contains the parameter name. The value of that variable can be
used in the function.

The following example is a function called Get-SmallFiles. This function has a
$size parameter. The function displays all the files that are smaller than the
value of the $size parameter, and it excludes directories:

```powershell
function Get-SmallFiles {
  Param($Size)
  Get-ChildItem $HOME | where {
    $_.Length -lt $Size -and !$_.PSIsContainer
  }
}
```

In the function, you can use the $size variable, which is the name defined for
the parameter.

To use this function, type the following command:

```powershell
Get-SmallFiles -Size 50
```

You can also enter a value for a named parameter without the parameter name.
For example, the following command gives the same result as a command that
names the Size parameter:

```powershell
Get-SmallFiles 50
```

To define a default value for a parameter, type an equal sign and the value
after the parameter name, as shown in the following variation of the
Get-SmallFiles example:

```powershell
function Get-SmallFiles ($Size = 100) {
  Get-ChildItem $HOME | where {
    $_.Length -lt $Size -and !$_.PSIsContainer
  }
}
```

If you type "Get-SmallFiles" without a value, the function assigns 100 to
$size. If you provide a value, the function uses that value.

Optionally, you can provide a brief help string that describes the default
value of your parameter, by adding the PSDefaultValue attribute to the
description of your parameter, and specifying the Help property of
PSDefaultValue. To provide a help string that describes the default value
(100) of the Size parameter in the Get-SmallFiles function, add the
PSDefaultValue attribute as shown in the following example.

```powershell
function Get-SmallFiles {
  param (
  [PSDefaultValue(Help = '100')]
  $size = 100
  # )
```

For more information about the PSDefaultValue attribute class, see
[PSDefaultValue Attribute Members](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.psdefaultvalueattribute_members(v=vs.85).aspx) on MSDN.


### Positional Parameters

A positional parameter is a parameter without a parameter name. Windows
PowerShell uses the parameter value order to associate each parameter value
with a parameter in the function.

When you use positional parameters, type one or more values after the function
name. Positional parameter values are assigned to the $args array variable.
The value that follows the function name is assigned to the first position in
the $args array, $args[0].

The following Get-Extension function adds the .txt file name extension to a
file name that you supply:

```powershell
function Get-Extension {
  $name = $args[0] + ".txt"
  $name
}
```

```powershell
C:\PS> Get-Extension myTextFile
myTextFile.txt
```

### Switch Parameters

A switch is a parameter that does not require a value. Instead, you type the
function name followed by the name of the switch parameter.

To define a switch parameter, specify the type [switch] before the parameter
name, as shown in the following example:

```powershell
function Switch-Item {
  param ([switch]$on)
  if ($on) { "Switch on" }
  else { "Switch off" }
}
```

When you type the On switch parameter after the function name, the function
displays "Switch on". Without the switch parameter, it displays "Switch off".

```powershell
C:\PS> Switch-Item -on
Switch on

C:\PS> Switch-Item
Switch off
```

You can also assign a Boolean value to a switch when you run the function, as
shown in the following example:

```powershell
C:\PS> Switch-Item -on:$true
Switch on

C:\PS> Switch-Item -on:$false
Switch off
```

### Using Splatting to Represent Command Parameters

You can use splatting to represent the parameters of a command. This feature
is introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

Use this technique in functions that call commands in the session. You do not
need to declare or enumerate the command parameters, or change the function
when command parameters change.

The following sample function calls the Get-Command cmdlet. The command uses
@Args to represent the parameters of Get-Command.

```powershell
function Get-MyCommand { Get-Command @Args }
```

You can use all of the parameters of Get-Command when you call the
Get-MyCommand function. The parameters and parameter values are passed to the
command using @Args.

```powershell
PS C:> Get-MyCommand -Name Get-ChildItem
CommandType     Name                ModuleName
-----------     ----                ----------
Cmdlet          Get-ChildItem       Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
```

The @Args feature uses the $Args automatic parameter, which represents
undeclared cmdlet parameters and values from remaining arguments.

For more information about splatting, see [about_Splatting](about_Splatting.md).

### Piping Objects to Functions

Any function can take input from the pipeline. You can control how a function
processes input from the pipeline using Begin, Process, and End keywords. The
following sample syntax shows the three keywords:

```powershell
function <name> {
  begin {<statement list>}
  process {<statement list>}
  end {<statement list>}
}
```

The Begin statement list runs one time only, at the beginning of the function.

The Process statement list runs one time for each object in the pipeline.
While the Process block is running, each pipeline object is assigned to the
`$_` automatic variable, one pipeline object at a time.

After the function receives all the objects in the pipeline, the End statement
list runs one time. If no Begin, Process, or End keywords are used, all the
statements are treated like an End statement list.

The following function uses the Process keyword. The function displays
examples from the pipeline:

```powershell
function Get-Pipeline
{
  process {"The value is: $_"}
}
```

To demonstrate this function, enter an list of numbers separated by commas, as
shown in the following example:

```powershell
C:\PS> 1,2,4 | Get-Pipeline
The value is: 1
The value is: 2
The value is: 4
```

When you use a function in a pipeline, the objects piped to the function are
assigned to the $input automatic variable. The function runs statements with
the Begin keyword before any objects come from the pipeline. The function runs
statements with the End keyword after all the objects have been received from
the pipeline.

The following example shows the $input automatic variable with Begin and End
keywords.

```powershell
function Get-PipelineBeginEnd
{
  begin {"Begin: The input is $input"}
  end {"End:   The input is $input" }
}
```

If this function is run by using the pipeline, it displays the following
results:

```powershell
C:\PS> 1,2,4 | Get-PipelineBeginEnd
Begin: The input is
End:   The input is 1 2 4
```

When the Begin statement runs, the function does not have the input from the
pipeline. The End statement runs after the function has the values.

If the function has a Process keyword, the function reads the data in $input.
The following example has a Process statement list:

```powershell
function Get-PipelineInput
{
  process {"Processing:  $_ " }
  end {"End:   The input is: $input" }
}
```

In this example, each object that is piped to the function is sent to the
Process statement list. The Process statements run on each object, one object
at a time. The $input automatic variable is empty when the function reaches
the End keyword.

```powershell
C:\PS> 1,2,4 | Get-PipelineInput
Processing:  1
Processing:  2
Processing:  4
End:   The input is:
```

### Filters

A filter is a type of function that runs on each object in the pipeline. A
filter resembles a function with all its statements in a Process block.

The syntax of a filter is as follows:

```powershell
filter [<scope:>]<name> {<statement list>}
```

The following filter takes log entries from the pipeline and then displays
either the whole entry or only the message portion of the entry:

```powershell
filter Get-ErrorLog ([switch]$message)
{
  if ($message) { out-host -inputobject $_.Message }
  else { $_ }
}
```

### Function Scope

A function exists in the scope in which it was created.

If a function is part of a script, the function is available to statements
within that script. By default, a function in a script is not available at the
command prompt.

You can specify the scope of a function. For example, the function is added to
the global scope in the following example:

```powershell
function global:Get-DependentSvs {
  Get-Service | where {$_.DependentServices}
}
```

When a function is in the global scope, you can use the function in scripts,
in functions, and at the command line.

Functions normally create a scope. The items created in a function, such as
variables, exist only in the function scope.

For more information about scope in PowerShell, see
[about_Scopes](about_Scopes.md).

### Finding and Managing Functions Using the Function: Drive

All the functions and filters in PowerShell are automatically stored
in the Function: drive. This drive is exposed by the PowerShell
Function provider.

When referring to the Function: drive, type a colon after Function, just as
you would do when referencing the C or D drive of a computer.

The following command displays all the functions in the current session of
PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem function:
```

The commands in the function are stored as a script block in the definition
property of the function. For example, to display the commands in the Help
function that comes with PowerShell, type:

```powershell
(Get-ChildItem function:help).Definition
```

For more information about the Function: drive, see the help topic
for the Function provider. Type `Get-Help Function`.

### Reusing Functions in New Sessions

When you type a function at the PowerShell command prompt, the
function becomes part of the current session. It is available until the
session ends.

To use your function in all PowerShell sessions, add the function
to your PowerShell profile. For more information about profiles,
see [about_Profiles](about_Profiles.md).

You can also save your function in a PowerShell script file. Type your
function in a text file, and then save the file with the .ps1 file name
extension.

### Writing Help for Functions

The Get-Help cmdlet gets help for functions, as well as for cmdlets,
providers, and scripts. To get help for a function, type Get-Help followed by
the function name.

For example, to get help for the Get-MyDisks function, type:

```powershell
Get-Help Get-MyDisks
```

You can write help for a function by using either of the two following
methods:

- Comment-Based Help  for Functions

  Create a help topic by using special keywords in the comments. To create
  comment-based help for a function, the comments must be placed at the
  beginning or end of the function body or on the lines preceding the function
  keyword. For more information about comment-based help, see
  [about_Comment_Based_Help](about_Comment_Based_Help.md).

- XML-Based Help  for Functions

  Create an XML-based help topic, such as the type that is typically created
  for cmdlets. XML-based help is required if you are localizing help topics
  into multiple languages.

  To associate the function with the XML-based help topic, use the
  .ExternalHelp comment-based help keyword. Without this keyword, Get-Help
  cannot find the function help topic and calls to Get-Help for the function
  return only auto-generated help.

  For more information about the ExternalHelp keyword, see
  [about_Comment_Based_Help](about_Comment_Based_Help.md). For more
  information about XML-based help, see [How to Write Cmdlet
  Help](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=123415) in the MSDN library.
