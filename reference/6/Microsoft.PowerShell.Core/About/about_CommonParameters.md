# About CommonParameters

## SHORT DESCRIPTION

Describes the parameters that can be used with any cmdlet.

## LONG DESCRIPTION

The common parameters are a set of cmdlet parameters that you can use with any
cmdlet. They are implemented by PowerShell, not by the cmdlet
developer, and they are automatically available to any cmdlet.

You can use the common parameters with any cmdlet, but they might not have an
effect on all cmdlets. For example, if a cmdlet does not generate any verbose
output, using the Verbose common parameter has no effect.

The common parameters are also available on advanced functions that use the
CmdletBinding attribute or the Parameter attribute, and on all workflows.

Several common parameters override system defaults or preferences that you set
by using the PowerShell preference variables. Unlike the preference
variables, the common parameters affect only the commands in which they are
used.

In addition to the common parameters, many cmdlets offer the WhatIf and
Confirm risk mitigation parameters. Cmdlets that involve risk to the system or
to user data usually offer these parameters.

The following list displays the common parameters. Their aliases are listed in
parentheses.

* Debug (db)
* ErrorAction (ea)
* ErrorVariable (ev)
* InformationAction (infa)
* InformationVariable (iv)
* OutVariable (ov)
* OutBuffer (ob)
* PipelineVariable (pv)
* Verbose (vb)
* WarningAction (wa)
* WarningVariable (wv)

The risk mitigation parameters are:

* WhatIf (wi)
* Confirm (cf)

### COMMON PARAMETER DESCRIPTIONS

-Debug[:{$true | $false}]

Alias: db

Displays programmer-level detail about the operation performed by the command.
This parameter works only when the command generates a debugging message. For
example, this parameter works when a command contains the Write-Debug cmdlet.

The Debug parameter overrides the value of the $DebugPreference variable for
the current command, setting the value of $DebugPreference to Inquire. Because
the default value of the $DebugPreference variable is SilentlyContinue,
debugging messages are not displayed by default.

Valid values:

- $true (-Debug:$true). Has the same effect as -Debug.

- $false (-Debug:$false). Suppresses the display of debugging messages when
  the value of the $DebugPreference is not SilentlyContinue (the default).

-ErrorAction[:{Continue | Ignore | Inquire | SilentlyContinue | Stop |
Suspend }]

Alias: ea

Determines how the cmdlet responds to a non-terminating error from the
command. This parameter works only when the command generates a
non-terminating error, such as those from the Write-Error cmdlet.

The ErrorAction parameter overrides the value of the $ErrorActionPreference
variable for the current command. Because the default value of the
$ErrorActionPreference variable is Continue, error messages are displayed and
execution continues unless you use the ErrorAction parameter.

The ErrorAction parameter has no effect on terminating errors (such as missing
data, parameters that are not valid, or insufficient permissions) that prevent
a command from completing successfully.

Valid values:

- Continue. Displays the error message and continues executing the command.
  "Continue" is the default value.

- Ignore. Suppresses the error message and continues executing the command.
  Unlike SilentlyContinue, Ignore does not add the error message to the $Error
  automatic variable. The Ignore value is introduced in PowerShell 3.0.

- Inquire. Displays the error message and prompts you for confirmation before
  continuing execution. This value is rarely used.

- SilentlyContinue. Suppresses the error message and continues executing the
  command.

- Stop. Displays the error message and stops executing the command.

- Suspend. This value is only available in PowerShell workflows. When
  a workflow runs into terminating error, this action preference automatically
  suspends the job to allow for further investigation. After investigation,
  the workflow can be resumed.

-ErrorVariable [+]<variable-name>

Alias: ev

Stores error messages about the command in the specified variable and in the
$Error automatic variable. For more information, type the following command:

```powershell
get-help about_Automatic_Variables
```

By default, new error messages overwrite error messages that are already
stored in the variable. To append the error message to the variable content,
type a plus sign (+) before the variable name.

For example, the following command creates the $a variable and then stores any
errors in it:

```powershell
Get-Process -Id 6 -ErrorVariable a
```
The following command adds any error messages to the $a variable:

```powershell
Get-Process -Id 2 -ErrorVariable +a
```

The following command displays the contents of $a:

```powershell
$a
```

You can use this parameter to create a variable that contains only error
messages from specific commands. The $Error automatic variable contains error
messages from all the commands in the session. You can use array notation,
such as $a[0] or $error[1,2] to refer to specific errors stored in the
variables.

-InformationAction [:{SilentlyContinue | Stop | Continue | Inquire | Ignore |
Suspend}]

Alias: ia

Introduced in PowerShell 5.0. Within the command or script in which it is
used, the InformationAction common parameter overrides the value of the
$InformationPreference preference variable, which by default is set to
SilentlyContinue. When you use Write-Information in a script with
-InformationAction, Write-Information values are shown depending on the value
of the -InformationAction parameter. For more information about
$InformationPreference, see about_Preference_Variables.

Valid values:

- Stop: Stops a command or script at an occurrence of the Write-Information
  command.

- Ignore: Suppresses the informational message and continues running the
  command. Unlike SilentlyContinue, Ignore completely "forgets" the
  informational message; it does not add the informational message to the
  information stream.

- Inquire: Displays the informational message that you specify in a
  Write-Information command, then asks whether you want to continue.

- Continue: Displays the informational message, and continues running.

- Suspend: Automatically suspends a workflow job after a Write-Information
  command is carried out, to allow users to see the messages before
  continuing. The workflow can be resumed at the userâ€™s discretion.

- SilentlyContinue: No effect. The informational messages are not (Default)
  displayed, and the script continues without interruption.

-InformationVariable [+]<variable-name>

Alias: iv

Introduced in PowerShell 5.0. Within the command or script in which it is
used, the InformationVariable common parameter stores in a variable a string
that you specify by adding the Write-Information command. Write-Information
values are shown depending on the value of the -InformationAction common
parameter; if you do not add the -InformationAction common parameter,
Write-Information strings are shown depending on the value of the
$InformationPreference preference variable. For more information about
$InformationPreference, see about_Preference_Variables.

-OutBuffer <Int32>

Alias: ob

Determines the number of objects to accumulate in a buffer before any objects
are sent through the pipeline. If you omit this parameter, objects are sent as
they are generated.

This resource management parameter is designed for advanced users. When you
use this parameter, PowerShell does not call the next cmdlet in the
pipeline until the number of objects generated equals OutBuffer + 1.
Thereafter, it sends all objects as they are generated.

-OutVariable [+]<variable-name>
Alias: ov

Stores output objects from the command in the specified variable and displays
it at the command line.

To add the output to the variable, instead of replacing any output that might
already be stored there, type a plus sign (+) before the variable name.

For example, the following command creates the $out variable and stores the
process object in it:

```powershell
Get-Process PowerShell -OutVariable out
```

The following command adds the process object to the $out variable:

```powershell
Get-Process iexplore -OutVariable +out
```

The following command displays the contents of the $out variable:

```powershell
$out
```

-PipelineVariable <String>

Alias: pv

PipelineVariable stores the value of the current pipeline element as a
variable, for any named command as it flows through the pipeline.

Valid values are strings, the same as for any variable names.

The following is an example of how PipelineVariable works. In this example,
the PipelineVariable parameter is added to a Foreach-Object command to store
the results of the command in variables. A range of numbers, 1 to 10, are
piped into the first Foreach-Object command, the results of which are stored
in a variable named Left.

The results of the first Foreach-Object command are piped into a second
Foreach-Object command, which filters the objects returned by the first
Foreach-Object command. The results of the second command are stored in a
variable named Right.

In the third Foreach-Object command, the results of the first two
Foreach-Object piped commands, represented by the variables Left and Right,
are processed by using a multiplication operator. The command instructs
objects stored in the Left and Right variables to be multiplied, and specifies
that the results should be displayed as "Left range member * Right range
member = product".

```powershell
1..10 | Foreach-Object -PipelineVariable Left -Process { $_ } |
  Foreach-Object -PV Right -Process { 1..10 } |
  Foreach-Object -Process { "$Left * $Right = " + ($Left*$Right) }
```

```output
1 * 1 = 1
1 * 2 = 2
1 * 3 = 3
1 * 4 = 4
1 * 5 = 5
...
```

-Verbose[:{$true | $false}]

Alias: vb

Displays detailed information about the operation performed by the command.
This information resembles the information in a trace or in a transaction log.
This parameter works only when the command generates a verbose message. For
example, this parameter works when a command contains the Write-Verbose
cmdlet.

The Verbose parameter overrides the value of the $VerbosePreference variable
for the current command. Because the default value of the $VerbosePreference
variable is SilentlyContinue, verbose messages are not displayed by default.

Valid values:

- $true (-Verbose:$true) has the same effect as -Verbose.

- $false (-Verbose:$false) suppresses the display of verbose messages. Use
  this parameter when the value of $VerbosePreference is not SilentlyContinue
  (the default).

-WarningAction[:{Continue | Inquire | SilentlyContinue | Stop}]

Alias: wa

Determines how the cmdlet responds to a warning from the command. "Continue"
is the default value. This parameter works only when the command generates a
warning message. For example, this parameter works when a command contains the
Write-Warning cmdlet.

The WarningAction parameter overrides the value of the $WarningPreference
variable for the current command. Because the default value of the
$WarningPreference variable is Continue, warnings are displayed and execution
continues unless you use the WarningAction parameter.

Valid Values:

- Continue. Displays the warning message and continues executing the command.
  "Continue" is the default value.

- Inquire. Displays the warning message and prompts you for confirmation
  before continuing execution. This value is rarely used.

- SilentlyContinue. Suppresses the warning message and continues executing the
  command.

- Stop. Displays the warning message and stops executing the command.

NOTE: The WarningAction parameter does not override the value of the
$WarningAction preference variable when the parameter is used in a command to
run a script or function.

-WarningVariable [+]<variable-name>

Alias: wv

Stores warnings about the command in the specified variable.

All generated warnings are saved in the variable even if the warnings are not
displayed to the user.

To append the warnings to the variable content, instead of replacing any
warnings that might already be stored there, type a plus sign (+) before the
variable name.

For example, the following command creates the $a variable and then stores any
warnings in it:

```powershell
Get-Process -Id 6 -WarningVariable a
```

The following command adds any warnings to the $a variable:

```powershell
Get-Process -Id 2 -WarningVariable +a
```

The following command displays the contents of $a:

```powershell
$a
```

You can use this parameter to create a variable that contains only warnings
from specific commands. You can use array notation, such as $a[0] or
$warning[1,2] to refer to specific warnings stored in the variable.

NOTE: The WarningVariable parameter does not capture warnings from nested
calls in functions or scripts.

### Risk Management Parameter Descriptions

-WhatIf[:{$true | $false}]

Alias: wi

Displays a message that describes the effect of the command, instead of
executing the command.

The WhatIf parameter overrides the value of the $WhatIfPreference variable for
the current command. Because the default value of the $WhatIfPreference
variable is 0 (disabled), WhatIf behavior is not performed without the WhatIf
parameter. For more information, type the following command:

```powershell
Get-Help about_Preference_Variables
```

Valid values:

- $true (-WhatIf:$true). Has the same effect as -WhatIf.

- $false (-WhatIf:$false). Suppresses the automatic WhatIf behavior that
  results when the value of the $WhatIfPreference variable is 1.

For example, the following command uses the WhatIf parameter in a Remove-Item
command:

```powershell
PS> Remove-Item Date.csv -WhatIf
```

Instead of removing the item, PowerShell lists the operations it would
perform and the items that would be affected. This command produces the
following output:

```output
What if: Performing operation "Remove File" on
Target "C:\ps-test\date.csv".
```

-Confirm[:{$true | $false}]

Alias: cf

Prompts you for confirmation before executing the command.

The Confirm parameter overrides the value of the $ConfirmPreference variable
for the current command. The default value is true. For more information, type
the following command:

```powershell
Get-Help about_Preference_Variables
```

Valid values:

- $true (-Confirm:$true). Has the same effect as -Confirm.

- $false(-Confirm:$false). Suppresses automatic confirmation, which occurs
  when the value of $ConfirmPreference is less than or equal to the estimated
  risk of the cmdlet.

For example, the following command uses the Confirm parameter with a
Remove-Item command. Before removing the item, PowerShell lists the
operations it would perform and the items that would be affected, and asks for
approval.

```powershell
PS C:\ps-test> Remove-Item tmp*.txt -Confirm
```

This command produces the following output:

```output
Confirm
Are you sure you want to perform this action?
Performing operation "Remove File" on Target " C:\ps-test\tmp1.txt
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend
[?] Help (default is "Y"):
```

The Confirm response options are as follows:

|Response       |Result                                                     |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|Yes (Y)        |Perform the action.                                        |
|Yes to All (A) |Perform all actions and suppress subsequent Confirm queries|
|               |for this command.                                          |
|No (N):        |Do not perform the action.                                 |
|No to All (L): |Do not perform any actions and suppress subsequent Confirm |
|               |queries for this command.                                  |
|Suspend (S):   |Pause the command and create a temporary session.          |
|Help (?)       |Display help for these options.                            |

The Suspend option places the command on hold and creates a temporary nested
session in which you can work until you're ready to choose a Confirm option.
The command prompt for the nested session has two extra carets (>>) to
indicate that it's a child operation of the original parent command. You can
run commands and scripts in the nested session. To end the nested session and
return to the Confirm options for the original command, type "exit".

In the following example, the Suspend option (S) is used to halt a command
temporarily while the user checks the help for a command parameter. After
obtaining the needed information, the user types "exit" to end the nested
prompt and then selects the Yes (y) response to the Confirm query.

```powershell
PS C:\ps-test> New-Item -ItemType File -Name Test.txt -Confirm
```

```output
Confirm
Are you sure you want to perform this action?

Performing operation "Create File" on Target "Destination:
C:\ps-test\test.txt".
[Y] Yes [A] Yes to All [N] No [L] No to All [S] Suspend [?] Help (default
is "Y"): s

PS C:\ps-test> Get-Help New-Item -Parameter ItemType

-ItemType <string>
