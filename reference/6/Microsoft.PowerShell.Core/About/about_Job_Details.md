# About Job Details

# SHORT DESCRIPTION

Provides details about background jobs on local and remote computers.

# DETAILED DESCRIPTION

This topic explains the concept of a background job and provides technical
information about how background jobs work in PowerShell.

This topic is a supplement to the [about_Jobs](about_Jobs.md) and
[about_Remote_Jobs](about_Remote_Jobs.md) topics.

# ABOUT BACKGROUND JOBS

A background job runs a command or expression asynchronously. It might run
a cmdlet, a function, a script, or any other command-based task. It is
designed to run commands that take an extended period of time, but you
can use it to run any command in the background.

When a synchronous command runs, the PowerShell command prompt is
suppressed until the command is complete. But a background job does not
suppress the PowerShell prompt. A command to start a background job
returns a job object. The prompt returns immediately so you can work on
other tasks while the background job runs.

However, when you start a background job, you do not get the results
immediately even if the job runs very quickly. The job object that is
returned contains useful information about the job, but it does not contain
the job results. You must run a separate command to get the job results.
You can also run commands to stop the job, to wait for the job to be
completed, and to delete the job.

To make the timing of a background job independent of other commands, each
background job runs in its own PowerShell environment
(a "session"). However, this can be a temporary connection that is created
only to run the job and is then destroyed, or it can be a persistent
session (a PSSession) that you can use to run several related jobs or
commands.

# USING THE JOB CMDLETS

Use a Start-Job command to start a background job on a local computer.
Start-Job returns a job object. You can also get objects representing the
jobs that were started on the local computer by using the Get-Job cmdlet.

To get the job results, use a Receive-Job command. If the job is not
complete, Receive-Job returns partial results. You can also use the
Wait-Job cmdlet to suppress the command prompt until one or all of the
jobs that were started in the session are complete.

To stop a background job, use the Stop-Job cmdlet. To delete a job, use
the Remove-Job cmdlet.

For more information about how the cmdlets work, see the Help topic for
each cmdlet, and see about_Jobs.

# STARTING BACKGROUND JOBS ON REMOTE COMPUTERS

You can create and manage background jobs on a local or remote computer. To
run a background job remotely, use the AsJob parameter of a cmdlet such as
Invoke-Command, or use the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a Start-Job
command remotely. You can also start a background job in an interactive
session.

For more information about remote background jobs, see about_Remote_Jobs.

# CHILD JOBS

Each background job consists of a parent job and one or more child jobs. In
jobs started by using Start-Job or the AsJob parameter of Invoke-Command,
the parent job is an executive. It does not run any commands or return any
results. The commands are actually run by the child jobs. (Jobs started by
using other cmdlets might work differently.)

The child jobs are stored in the ChildJobs property of the parent job
object. The ChildJobs property can contain one or many child job objects.
The child job objects have a name, ID, and instance ID that differ
from the parent job so that you can manage the parent and child jobs
individually or as a unit.

To get the parent and child jobs of a job, use the IncludeChildJobs
parameter of the Get-Job cmdlet. The IncludeChildJob parameter is
introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```powershell
C:\PS> Get-Job -IncludeChildJob

Id Name   PSJobTypeName State      HasMoreData   Location    Command
-- ----   ------------- -----      -----------   --------    -------
1  Job1   RemoteJob     Failed     True          localhost   Get-Process
2  Job2                 Completed  True          Server01    Get-Process
3  Job3                 Failed     False         localhost   Get-Process
```

To get the parent job and only the child jobs with a particular State
value, use the ChildJobState parameter of the Get-Job cmdlet. The
ChildJobState parameter is introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```powershell
C:\PS> Get-Job -ChildJobState Failed

Id Name   PSJobTypeName State      HasMoreData   Location    Command
-- ----   ------------- -----      -----------   --------    -------
1  Job1   RemoteJob     Failed     True          localhost   Get-Process
3  Job3                 Failed     False         localhost   Get-Process
```

To get the child jobs of a job on all versions of PowerShell,
use the ChildJob property of the parent job.

```powershell
C:\PS> (Get-Job Job1).ChildJobs

Id Name   PSJobTypeName State      HasMoreData   Location    Command
-- ----   ------------- -----      -----------   --------    -------
2  Job2                 Completed  True          Server01    Get-Process
3  Job3                 Failed     False         localhost   Get-Process
```

You can also use a Get-Job command on the child job, as shown in the
following command:

```powershell
C:\PS> Get-Job Job3

Id Name   PSJobTypeName State      HasMoreData   Location    Command
-- ----   ------------- -----      -----------   --------    -------
3  Job3                 Failed     False         localhost   Get-Process
```

The configuration of the child job depends on the command that you use to
start the job.

- When you use Start-Job to start a job on a local computer, the job consists
  of an executive parent job and a child job that runs the command.

- When you use the AsJob parameter of Invoke-Command to start a job on one or
  more computers, the job consists of an executive parent job and a child job
  for each job run on each computer.

- When you use Invoke-Command to run a Start-Job command on one or more remote
  computers, the result is the same as a local command run on each remote
  computer. The command returns a job object for each computer. The job object
  consists of an executive parent job and one child job that runs the command.

The parent job represents all of the child jobs. When you manage a parent job,
you also manage the associated child jobs. For example, if you stop a parent
job, all child jobs are stopped. If you get the results of a parent job, you
get the results of all child jobs.

However, you can also manage child jobs individually. This is most useful
when you want to investigate a problem with a job or get the results of
only one of a number of child jobs started by using the AsJob parameter of
Invoke-Command. (The backtick character [`] is the continuation character.)

The following command uses the AsJob parameter of Invoke-Command to start
background jobs on the local computer and two remote computers. The command
saves the job in the \$j variable.

```powershell
PS C:> $j = Invoke-Command -ComputerName localhost, Server01, Server02 `
-Command {Get-Date} -AsJob
```

When you display the Name and ChildJob properties of the job in \$j, it
shows that the command returned a job object with three child jobs, one for
each computer.

```powershell
PS C:> $j | Format-List Name, ChildJobs

Name      : Job3
ChildJobs : {Job4, Job5, Job6}
```

When you display the parent job, it shows that the job failed.

```powershell
C:\PS> $j

Id Name   PSJobTypeName State      HasMoreData   Location
-- ----   ------------- -----      -----------   --------
3  Job3   RemotingJob   Failed     False         localhost,Server...
```

But when you run a Get-Job command that gets the child jobs, the output
shows that only one child job failed.

```powershell
PS C:> Get-Job -IncludeChildJobs

Id  Name   PSJobTypeName State      HasMoreData   Location    Command
--  ----   ------------- -----      -----------   --------    -------
3   Job3   RemotingJob   Failed     False         localhost,Server...
4   Job4                 Completed  True          localhost   Get-Date
5   Job5                 Failed     False         Server01    Get-Date
6   Job6                 Completed  True          Server02    Get-Date
```

To get the results of all child jobs, use the Receive-Job cmdlet to get
the results of the parent job. But you can also get the results of a
particular child job, as shown in the following command.

```powershell
C:\PS> Receive-Job -Name Job6 -Keep | Format-Table ComputerName,
>> DateTime -Auto

ComputerName DateTime
------------ --------
Server02     Thursday, March 13, 2008 4:16:03 PM
```

The child jobs feature of PowerShell background jobs gives you
more control over the jobs that you run.

# JOB TYPES


PowerShell supports different types of jobs for different tasks.
Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, developers can write "job source
adapters" that add new job types to PowerShell and include the
job source adapters in modules. When you import the module, you can
use the new job type in your session.

For example, the PSScheduledJob module adds scheduled jobs and the
PSWorkflow module adds workflow jobs.

Custom jobs types might differ significantly from standard Windows
PowerShell background jobs. For example, scheduled jobs are saved
on disk; they do not exist only in a particular session. Workflow
jobs can be suspended and resumed.

The cmdlets that you use to manage custom jobs depend on the job
type. For some, you use the standard job cmdlets, such as Get-Job
and Start-Job. Others come with specialized cmdlets that manage
only a particular type of job. For detailed information about
custom job types, see the help topics about the job type.

To find the job type of a job, use the Get-Job cmdlet. Get-Job
returns different job objects for different types of jobs. The
value of the PSJobTypeName property of the job objects that
Get-Job returns indicates the job type.

The following table lists the job types that come with Windows
PowerShell.

|Job Type      |Description                                               |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|BackgroundJob |Started by using the Start-Job cmdlet.                    |
|RemoteJob     |Started by using the AsJob parameter of the Invoke-Command|
|              |cmdlet.                                                   |
|PSWorkflowJob |Started by using the AsJob parameter of a workflow.       |
|PSScheduledJob|An instance of a scheduled job started by a job trigger.  |
|CIMJob        |Started by using the AsJob parameter of a cmdlet from a   |
|              |CDXML module.                                             |
|WMIJob        |Started by using the AsJob parameter of a cmdlet from a   |
|              |WMI module.                                               |
|PSEventJob    |Created by running Register-ObjectEvent and specifying an |
|              |action with the Action parameter.                         |

NOTE: Before using the Get-Job cmdlet to get jobs of a particular type, verify
that the module that adds the job type is imported into the current session.
Otherwise, Get-Job does not get jobs of that type.

# EXAMPLE

The following commands create a local background job, a remote background job,
a workflow job, and a scheduled job. Then, it uses the Get-Job cmdlet to get
the jobs. `Get-Job` does not get the scheduled job, but it gets any started
instances of the scheduled job.

Start a background job on the local computer.

```powershell
PS C:> Start-Job -Name LocalData {Get-Process}

Id Name        PSJobTypeName   State   HasMoreData   Location   Command
-- ----        -------------   -----   -----------   --------   -------
2  LocalData   BackgroundJob   Running        True   localhost  Get-Process
```

Start a background job that runs on a remote computer.

```powershell
PS C:> Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server01 {Get-Process} `
-AsJob -JobName RemoteData

Id  Name        PSJobTypeName  State   HasMoreData   Location   Command
--  ----        -------------  -----   -----------   --------   -------
2   RemoteData  RemoteJob      Running        True   Server01   Get-Process
```

Create a scheduled job
```powershell
PS C:>  Register-ScheduledJob -Name ScheduledJob -ScriptBlock `
 {Get-Process} -Trigger (New-JobTrigger -Once -At "3 PM")

Id         Name            JobTriggers     Command       Enabled
--         ----            -----------     -------       -------
1          ScheduledJob    1               Get-Process   True
```

Create a workflow.
```powershell
PS C:> workflow Test-Workflow {Get-Process}
```

Run the workflow as a job.
```powershell

PS C:> Test-Workflow -AsJob -JobName TestWFJob

Id  Name       PSJobTypeName   State   HasMoreData   Location   Command
--  ----       -------------   -----   -----------   --------   -------
2   TestWFJob  PSWorkflowJob   NotStarted     True   localhost  Get-Process
```

Get the jobs. The `Get-Job` command does not get scheduled jobs, but it gets
instances of the scheduled job that are started.

```powershell
PS C:> Get-Job

Id  Name         PSJobTypeName  State     HasMoreData  Location  Command
--  ----         -------------  -----     -----------  --------  -------
2   LocalData    BackgroundJob  Completed True         localhost Get-Process
4   RemoteData   RemoteJob      Completed True         Server01  Get-Process
6   TestWFJob    PSWorkflowJob  Completed True         localhost WorkflowJob
8   ScheduledJob PSScheduledJob Completed True         localhost Get-Process
```

To get scheduled jobs, use the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet.

```powershell
PS C:> Get-ScheduledJob

Id         Name            JobTriggers     Command       Enabled
--         ----            -----------     -------       -------
1          ScheduledJob    1               Get-Process   True
```
