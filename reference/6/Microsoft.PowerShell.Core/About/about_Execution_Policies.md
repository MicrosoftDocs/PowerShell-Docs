# About Execution Policies

## Short Description

Describes the PowerShell execution policies and explains how to manage them.

## Long Description

PowerShell's execution policy is a safety feature that controls the conditions
under which PowerShell loads configuration files and runs scripts. This feature
helps prevent the the execution of malicious scripts.

On a Windows computer you can set an execution policy for the local computer,
for the current user, or for a particular session. You can also use a Group
Policy setting to set execution policies for computers and users.

Execution policies for the local computer and current user are stored in the
registry. You don't need to set execution policies in your PowerShell profile.
The execution policy for a particular session is stored only in memory and is
lost when the session is closed.

The execution policy isn't a security system that restricts user actions. For
example, users can easily bypass a policy by typing the script contents at
the command line when they cannot run a script. Instead, the execution policy
helps users to set basic rules and prevents them from violating them
unintentionally.

On non-Windows computers, the default execution policy is **Unrestricted** and
cannot be changed. The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet is available, but
PowerShell displays a console message that it's not supported.

## PowerShell Execution Policies

The PowerShell execution policies are as follows:

### AllSigned

- Scripts can run.
- Requires that all scripts and configuration files be signed by a trusted
  publisher, including scripts that you write on the local computer.
- Prompts you before running scripts from publishers that you haven't yet
  classified as trusted or untrusted.
- Risks running signed, but malicious, scripts.

### Bypass

- Nothing is blocked and there are no warnings or prompts.
- This execution policy is designed for configurations in which a PowerShell
  script is built in to a larger application or for configurations in which
  PowerShell is the foundation for a program that has its own security model.

### Default

- Sets the default execution policy.
- **Restricted** for Windows clients.
- **RemoteSigned** for Windows servers.

### RemoteSigned

- The default execution policy for Windows server computers.
- Scripts can run.
- Requires a digital signature from a trusted publisher on scripts and
  configuration files that are downloaded from the internet which includes
  email and instant messaging programs.
- Doesn't require digital signatures on scripts that are written on the local
  computer and not downloaded from the internet.
- Runs scripts that are downloaded from the internet and not signed, if the
  scripts are unblocked, such as by using the `Unblock-File` cmdlet.
- Risks running unsigned scripts from sources other than the internet and
  signed, but malicious, scripts.

### Restricted

- The default execution policy for Windows client computers.
- Permits individual commands, but will not run scripts.
- Prevents running of all script files, including formatting and configuration
  files (`.ps1xml`), module script files (`.psm1`), and PowerShell profiles
  (`.ps1`).

### Undefined

- There is no execution policy set in the current scope.
- If the execution policy in all scopes is **Undefined**, the effective
  execution policy is **Restricted**, which is the default execution policy.

### Unrestricted

- The default execution policy for non-Windows computers and cannot be
  changed.
- Unsigned scripts can run. There is a risk of running malicious scripts.
- Warns the user before running scripts and configuration files that are
  downloaded from the internet.

> [!NOTE]
> On systems that do not distinguish Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths
> from internet paths, scripts that are identified by a UNC path might not be
> permitted to run with the **RemoteSigned** execution policy.

## Execution Policy Scope

You can set an execution policy that is effective only in a particular scope.

The valid values for **Scope** are **MachinePolicy**, **UserPolicy**,
**Process**, **CurrentUser**, and **LocalMachine**. **LocalMachine** is the
default when setting an execution policy.

The **Scope** values are listed in precedence order. The policy that takes
precedence is effective in the current session, even if a more restrictive
policy was set at a lower level of precedence.

For more information, see [Set-ExecutionPolicy](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Security/Set-ExecutionPolicy.md).

### MachinePolicy

Set by a Group Policy for all users of the computer.

### UserPolicy

Set by a Group Policy for the current user of the computer.

### Process

The **Process** scope only affects the current PowerShell session. The
execution policy is saved in the environment variable
`$env:PSExecutionPolicyPreference`, rather than the registry. When the
PowerShell session is closed, the variable and value are deleted.

### CurrentUser

The execution policy affects only the current user. It's stored in the
**HKEY_CURRENT_USER** registry subkey.

### LocalMachine

The execution policy affects all users on the current computer. It's stored in
the **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE** registry subkey.

## Get Your Execution Policy

To get the effective execution policy for the current PowerShell session, use
the `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet.

The following command gets the effective execution policy:

```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy
```

To get all of the execution policies that affect the current session and
display them in precedence order:

```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
```

The result will look similar to the following sample output:

```Output
        Scope ExecutionPolicy
        ----- ---------------
MachinePolicy       Undefined
   UserPolicy       Undefined
      Process       Undefined
  CurrentUser    RemoteSigned
 LocalMachine       AllSigned
```

In this case, the effective execution policy is **RemoteSigned** because the
execution policy for the current user takes precedence over the execution
policy set for the local computer.

To get the execution policy set for a particular scope, use the **Scope**
parameter of `Get-ExecutionPolicy`.

For example, the following command gets the execution policy for the
**CurrentUser** scope:

```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Change Your Execution Policy

To change the PowerShell execution policy on your Windows computer, use the
`Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet. The change is effective immediately. You don't
need to restart PowerShell.

If you set the execution policy for the scopes **LocalMachine** or the
**CurrentUser**, the change is saved in the registry and remains effective
until you change it again.

If you set the execution policy for the **Process** scope, it's not saved in
the registry. The execution policy is retained until the current process and
any child processes are closed.

> [!NOTE]
> In Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, to run commands that
> change the execution policy for the local computer, **LocalMachine** scope,
> start PowerShell with the **Run as administrator** option.

To change your execution policy:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy <PolicyName>
```

For example:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

To set the execution policy in a particular scope:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy <PolicyName> -Scope <scope>
```

For example:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

A command to change an execution policy can succeed but still not change the
effective execution policy.

For example, a command that sets the execution policy for the local computer
can succeed but be overridden by the execution policy for the current user.

## Remove Your Execution Policy

To remove the execution policy for a particular scope, set the execution policy
to **Undefined**.

For example, to remove the execution policy for all the users of the local
computer:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Undefined -Scope LocalMachine
```

To remove the execution policy for a **Scope**:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Undefined -Scope CurrentUser
```

If no execution policy is set in any scope, the effective execution policy is
**Restricted**, which is the default for Windows clients.

## Set a Different Execution Policy for One Session

You can use the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter of **pwsh.exe** to set an
execution policy for a new PowerShell session. The policy affects only the
current session and child sessions.

To set the execution policy for a new session, start PowerShell at the command
line, such as **cmd.exe** or from PowerShell, and then use the
**ExecutionPolicy** parameter of **pwsh.exe** to set the execution policy.

For example:

```powershell
pwsh.exe -ExecutionPolicy AllSigned
```

The execution policy that you set isn't stored in the registry. Instead, it's
stored in the `$env:PSExecutionPolicyPreference` environment variable. The
variable is deleted when you close the session in which the policy is set. You
cannot change the policy by editing the variable value.

During the session, the execution policy that is set for the session takes
precedence over an execution policy that is set in the registry for the local
computer or current user. However, it doesn't take precedence over the
execution policy set by using a Group Policy.

## Use Group Policy to Manage Execution Policy

You can use the **Turn on Script Execution** Group Policy setting to manage the
execution policy of computers in your enterprise. The Group Policy setting
overrides the execution policies set in PowerShell in all scopes.

The **Turn on Script Execution** policy settings are as follows:

- If you disable **Turn on Script Execution**, scripts do not run. This is
  equivalent to the **Restricted** execution policy.
- If you enable **Turn on Script Execution**, you can select an execution
  policy. The Group Policy settings are equivalent to the following execution
  policy settings:

  | Group Policy                                   | Execution Policy |
  | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
  | Allow all scripts.                             | Unrestricted     |
  | Allow local scripts and remote signed scripts. | RemoteSigned     |
  | Allow only signed scripts.                     | AllSigned        |

- If **Turn on Script Execution** is not configured, it has no effect. The
  execution policy set in PowerShell is effective.

The PowerShellExecutionPolicy.adm and PowerShellExecutionPolicy.admx files add
the **Turn on Script Execution** policy to the Computer Configuration and User
Configuration nodes in Group Policy Editor in the following paths.

For Windows XP and Windows Server 2003:

Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows PowerShell

For Windows Vista and later versions of Windows:

Administrative Templates\Classic Administrative Templates\
Windows Components\Windows PowerShell

Policies set in the Computer Configuration node take precedence over policies
set in the User Configuration node.

For more information, see [about_Group_Policy_Settings](about_Group_Policy_Settings.md).

## Execution Policy Precedence

When determining the effective execution policy for a session, PowerShell
evaluates the execution policies in the following precedence order:

- Group Policy: MachinePolicy
- Group Policy: UserPolicy
- Execution Policy: Process (or `pwsh.exe -ExecutionPolicy`)
- Execution Policy: CurrentUser
- Execution Policy: LocalMachine

## Manage Signed and Unsigned Scripts

If your PowerShell execution policy is **RemoteSigned**, PowerShell won't run
unsigned scripts that are downloaded from the internet which includes email and
instant messaging programs.

You can sign the script or elect to run an unsigned script without changing the
execution policy.

Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, you can use the **Stream** parameter of the
`Get-Item` cmdlet to detect files that are blocked because they were downloaded
from the internet. Use the `Unblock-File` cmdlet to unblock the scripts so that
you can run them in PowerShell.

For more information, see [about_Signing](about_Signing.md), [Get-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Item.md),
and [Unblock-File](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Unblock-File.md).
