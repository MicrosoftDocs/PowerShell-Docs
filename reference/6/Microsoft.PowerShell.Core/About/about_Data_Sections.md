# About Data Sections
## about_Data_Sections


### Short Description

Explains Data sections, which isolate text strings and other read-only
data from script logic.

### Long Description

Scripts that are designed for PowerShell can have one or more
Data sections that contain only data. You can include one or more Data
sections in any script, function, or advanced function. The content of
the Data section is restricted to a specified subset of the Windows
PowerShell scripting language.

Separating data from code logic makes it easier to identify and manage
both logic and data. It lets you have separate string resource files for
text, such as error messages and Help strings. It also isolates the code
logic, which facilitates security and validation tests.

In PowerShell, the Data section is used to support script
internationalization. You can use Data sections to make it easier to
isolate, locate, and process strings that will be translated into many
user interface (UI) languages.

The Data section is a Windows PowerShell 2.0 feature. Scripts with Data
sections will not run in Windows PowerShell 1.0 without revision.

### Syntax

The syntax for a Data section is as follows:
```powershell
DATA [-supportedCommand <cmdlet-name>] {
    <Permitted content>
}
```

The Data keyword is required. It is not case-sensitive.

The permitted content is limited to the following elements:

- All PowerShell operators, except `-match`

- `If`, `Else`, and `ElseIf` statements

- The following automatic variables: `$PsCulture`,  `$PsUICulture`,  `$True`,
`$False`, and `$Null`

- Comments

- Pipelines

- Statements separated by semicolons (`;`)

- Literals, such as the following:

```powershell
a
```

```powershell
1
```

```powershell
1,2,3
```

```powershell
"Windows PowerShell 2.0"
```

```powershell
@( "red", "green", "blue" )
```
```powershell
@{ a = 0x1; b = "great"; c ="script" }
```

```powershell
[XML] @'
<p> Hello, World </p>
'@
```

- Cmdlets that are permitted in a Data section. By default, only the
`ConvertFrom-StringData` cmdlet is permitted.

- Cmdlets that you permit in a Data section by using the
`-SupportedCommand` parameter.

When you use the `ConvertFrom-StringData` cmdlet in a Data section, you can
enclose the key/value pairs in single-quoted or double-quoted strings or in
single-quoted or double-quoted here-strings. However, strings that contain
variables and subexpressions must be enclosed in single-quoted strings or
in single-quoted here-strings so that the variables are not expanded and the
subexpressions are not executable.

### -SupportedCommand

The `-SupportedCommand` parameter allows you to indicate that a cmdlet or
function generates only data. It is designed to allow users to include
cmdlets and functions in a data section that they have written or tested.

The value of `-SupportedCommand` is a comma-separated list of one or more
cmdlet or function names.

For example, the following data section includes a user-written cmdlet,
`Format-XML`, that formats data in an XML file:

```powershell
DATA -supportedCommand Format-Xml
{
    Format-Xml -Strings string1, string2, string3
}
```

### Using a Data Section

To use the content of a Data section, assign it to a variable and use
variable notation to access the content.

For example, the following data section contains a `ConvertFrom-StringData`
command that converts the here-string into a hash table. The hash table
is assigned to the `$TextMsgs` variable.

The `$TextMsgs` variable is not part of the data section.

```powershell
$TextMsgs = DATA {
    ConvertFrom-StringData -StringData @'
Text001 = Windows 7
Text002 = Windows Server 2008 R2
'@
}
```

To access the keys and values in hash table in $TextMsgs, use the
following commands.

```powershell
$TextMsgs.Text001
$TextMsgs.Text002
```

### Examples

Simple data strings.

```powershell
DATA {
    "Thank you for using my PowerShell Organize.pst script."
    "It is provided free of charge to the community."
    "I appreciate your comments and feedback."
}
```

Strings that include permitted variables.

```powershell
DATA {
    if ($null) {
        "To get help for this cmdlet, type get-help new-dictionary."
    }
}
```

A single-quoted here-string that uses the ConvertFrom-StringData cmdlet:

```powershell
DATA {
    ConvertFrom-StringData -stringdata @'
Text001 = Windows 7
Text002 = Windows Server 2008 R2
'@
}
```

A double-quoted here-string that uses the ConvertFrom-StringData cmdlet:

```powershell
DATA  {
    ConvertFrom-StringData -stringdata @"
Msg1 = To start, press any key.
Msg2 = To exit, type "quit".
"@
}
```

A data section that includes a user-written cmdlet that generates data:

```powershell
DATA -supportedCommand Format-XML {
    Format-Xml -strings string1, string2, string3
}
```
