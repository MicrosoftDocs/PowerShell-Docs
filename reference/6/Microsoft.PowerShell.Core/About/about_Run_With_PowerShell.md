# About Run With PowerShell

## SHORT DESCRIPTION

Explains how to use the "Run with PowerShell" feature to run a script from a
file system drive.

## LONG DESCRIPTION

Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, you can use the "Run with PowerShell"
feature to run scripts from File Explorer in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012
and from Windows Explorer in earlier versions of Windows.

The "Run with PowerShell" feature is designed to run scripts that do not have
required parameters and do not return output to the command prompt.

When you use the "Run with PowerShell" feature, the PowerShell console
window appears only briefly, if at all. You cannot interact with it.

To use the "Run with PowerShell" feature:

In File Explorer (or Windows Explorer), right-click the script file name and
then select "Run with PowerShell".

The "Run with PowerShell" feature starts a PowerShell session that has
an execution policy of Bypass, runs the script, and closes the session.

It runs a command that has the following format:

```
PowerShell.exe -File <FileName> -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

"Run with PowerShell" sets the Bypass execution policy only for the session
(the current instance of the PowerShell process) in which the script runs.
This feature does not change the execution policy for the computer or the
user.

The "Run with PowerShell" feature is affected only by the AllSigned execution
policy. If the AllSigned execution policy is effective for the computer or the
user, "Run with PowerShell" runs only signed scripts. "Run with PowerShell" is
not affected by any other execution policy. For more information, see
[about_Execution_Policies](about_Execution_Policies.md).

Troubleshooting Note: Run with PowerShell command might prompt you to confirm
the execution policy change.
