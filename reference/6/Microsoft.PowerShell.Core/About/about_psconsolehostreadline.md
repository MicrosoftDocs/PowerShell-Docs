# about_PSConsoleHostReadLine

## SHORT DESCRIPTION

Explains how to create a customize how PowerShell reads input at the console
prompt.

## LONG DESCRIPTION

Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, you can write a function named
PSConsoleHostReadLine that overrides the default way that console input is
processed.

### EXAMPLES

The following example launches Notepad and gets input from a text File that
the user creates:

```powershell
function PSConsoleHostReadLine
{
  $inputFile = Join-Path $env:TEMP PSConsoleHostReadLine
  Set-Content $inputFile "PS > "

  # Notepad opens. Enter your command in it, save the file, and then exit.
  notepad $inputFile | Out-Null
  $userInput = Get-Content $inputFile
  $resultingCommand = $userInput.Replace("PS >", "")
  $resultingCommand
}
```

### REMARKS

By default, PowerShell reads input from the console in what is known as
"Cooked Mode" -- in which the Windows console subsystem handles all the
keypresses, F7 menus, and other input. When you press Enter or Tab, Windows
PowerShell gets the text that you have typed up to that point. There is no way
for it to know that you pressed Ctrl-R, Ctrl-A, Ctrl-E, or any other keys
before pressing Enter or Tab. In Windows PowerShell 3.0, the
PSConsoleHostReadLine function solves this issue. When you define a function
named PSConsoleHostReadline in the PowerShell console host, Windows
PowerShell calls that function instead of the "Cooked Mode" input mechanism.
