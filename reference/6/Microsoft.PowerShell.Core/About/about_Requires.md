# About Requires

## Short description

Prevents a script from running without the required elements.

## Long description

The `#Requires` statement prevents a script from running unless the
PowerShell version, modules, snap-ins, module and snap-in version, and edition
prerequisites are met. If the prerequisites are not met, PowerShell
does not run the script.

### Syntax

```powershell
#Requires -Version <N>[.<n>]
#Requires -PSSnapin <PSSnapin-Name> [-Version <N>[.<n>]]
#Requires -Modules { <Module-Name> | <Hashtable> }
#Requires -PSEdition <PSEdition-Name>
#Requires -ShellId <ShellId>
#Requires -RunAsAdministrator
```

### Rules for use

- A script can include more than one `#Requires` statement.
- The `#Requires` statements can appear on any line in a script.
  
  Placing a `#Requires` statement inside a function does NOT limit its scope.
  All `#Requires` statements are always applied globally, and must be met,
  before the script can execute.
  > [!WARNING]
  > Even though a `#Requires` statement can appear on any line in a script,
  > its position in a script does not affect the sequence of its application.
  >
  > The global state the `#Requires` statement presents must be met before
  > script execution.
  
  Example:

  ```powershell
  Get-Module AzureRM.Netcore | Remove-Module
  #Requires -Modules AzureRM.Netcore
  ```

  You might think that the above code should not run because the required
  module was removed before the `#Requires` statement. However, the `#Requires`
  state had to be met before the script could even execute. Then the first line
  of the script invalidated the required state.

### Parameters

#### -Version \<N\>[.\<n\>]

Specifies the minimum version of PowerShell that the script requires.
Enter a major version number and optional minor version number.

For example:

```powershell
#Requires -Version 6.0
```

#### -PSSnapin \<PSSnapin-Name\> [-Version \<N\>[.\<n\>]]

Specifies a PowerShell snap-in that the script requires. Enter the
snap-in name and an optional version number.

For example:

```powershell
#Requires -PSSnapin DiskSnapin -Version 1.2
```

#### -Modules \<Module-Name\> | \<Hashtable\>

Specifies PowerShell modules that the script requires. Enter the
module name and an optional version number.

If the required modules are not in the current session, PowerShell
imports them. If the modules cannot be imported, PowerShell throws a
terminating error.

For each module, type the module name (\<String\>) or a hash table with the
following keys. The value can be a combination of strings and hash tables.

- `ModuleName` - __[Required]__ Specifies the module name.
- `GUID` - __[Optional]__ Specifies the GUID of the module.
- It is also **Required** to specify **one** of the two below keys,
  they cannot be used together.
  - `ModuleVersion` - __[Required]__ Specifies a minimum acceptable version of the module.
  - `RequiredVersion` - __[Required]__ Specifies an exact, required version of the module.

> [!NOTE]
> `RequiredVersion` was added in Windows Powershell 5.0.

For example:

Requires that `AzureRM.Netcore` (version `0.12.0` or greater) is installed.

```powershell
#Requires -Modules @{ ModuleName="AzureRM.Netcore"; ModuleVersion="0.12.0" }
```

Requires that `AzureRM.Netcore` (**only** version `0.12.0`) is installed.

```powershell
#Requires -Modules @{ ModuleName="AzureRM.Netcore"; RequiredVersion="0.12.0" }
```

Requires that any version of `AzureRM.Netcore` and `PowerShellGet` is installed.

```powershell
#Requires -Modules AzureRM.Netcore, PowerShellGet
```

When using the `RequiredVersion` key, ensure your version string exactly matches
the version string you wish to require.

```powershell
Get-Module AzureRM.Netcore -ListAvailable
```

```output
    Directory: /home/azureuser/.local/share/powershell/Modules


ModuleType Version Name            PSEdition ExportedCommands
---------- ------- ----            --------- ----------------
Script     0.12.0  AzureRM.Netcore Core
```

This will **FAIL**, because "0.12" does not exactly match "0.12.0"

```powershell
#Requires -Modules @{ ModuleName="AzureRM.Netcore"; RequiredVersion="0.12" }
```

#### -PSEdition \<PSEdition-Name\>

Specifies a PowerShell edition that the script requires.
Valid values are Core for PowerShell Core and Desktop for Windows PowerShell.

For example:

```powershell
#Requires -PSEdition Core
```

#### -ShellId

Specifies the shell that the script requires. Enter the shell ID.

For example:

```powershell
#Requires -ShellId MyLocalShell
```

You can find current ShellId by querying `$ShellId` automatic variable.

#### -RunAsAdministrator

When this switch parameter is added to your requires statement, it specifies
that the PowerShell session in which you are running the script must
be started with elevated user rights (Run as Administrator).
The RunAsAdministrator parameter is ignored on a non-Windows operating system.

For example:

```powershell
#Requires -RunAsAdministrator
```

### Examples

The following script has two `#Requires` statements. If the requirements
specified in both statements are not met, the script does not run. Each
`#Requires` statement must be the first item on a line:

```powershell
#Requires -Modules AzureRM.Netcore
#Requires -Version 6.0
Param
(
    [parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [String[]]
    $Path
)
...
```

### Notes

In Windows PowerShell 3.0, the Windows PowerShell Core packages appear as
modules in sessions started by using the InitialSessionState.CreateDefault2
method, such as sessions started in the Windows PowerShell console. Otherwise,
they appear as snap-ins. The exception is Microsoft.PowerShell.Core, which is
always a snap-in.
