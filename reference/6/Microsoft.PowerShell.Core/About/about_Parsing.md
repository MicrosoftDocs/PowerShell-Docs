# About Parsing

## SHORT DESCRIPTION
Describes how PowerShell parses commands.

## LONG DESCRIPTION

When you enter a command at the command prompt, PowerShell breaks the command
text into a series of segments called _tokens_ and then determines how to
interpret each token.

For example, if you type:

```powershell
Write-Host book
```

PowerShell breaks the command into two tokens, `Write-Host` and
`book`, and interprets each token independently using one of two 
major parsing modes: expression mode and argument mode.

### Expression mode

Expression mode is intended for combining expressions, 
required for value manipulation in a scripting language.
Expressions are representations of values in PowerShell syntax, 
and can be simple or composite, for example:

Literal expressions are direct representations of their values: 

```powershell
'hello', 32, $true
```

Variable expressions carry the value of the variable they reference: 

```powershell
$x, $script:path
```
Operators combine other expressions for evaluation: 

```powershell
- 12, -not $Quiet, 3 + 7, $input.Length -gt 1
```

* *Character string literals* must be contained in quotation marks. 
* *Numbers* are treated as numerical values rather than as a series of characters 
(unless escaped).
* *Operators*, including unary operators like `-` and `-not` 
and binary operators like `+` and `-gt`, are interpreted as operators 
and apply their respective operations on their arguments (operands).
* *Attribute and conversion expressions* are parsed as expressions 
and applied to subordinate expressions, e.g. `[int] '7'`.
* *Variable references* are evaluated to their values 
but *splatting* (i.e. pasting prefilled parameter sets) is forbidden 
and causes a parser error.
* Anything else will be treated as a command to be invoked.

### Argument mode

When parsing, PowerShell first looks to interpret input as an expression.
But when a command invocation is encountered, parsing continues in argument mode.

Argument mode is designed for parsing arguments and parameters for commands 
in a shell environment.  All input is treated as an expandable string 
unless it uses one of the following syntaxes:

* Dollar sign (`$`) begins a variable reference 
(only if it is followed by a valid variable name, 
otherwise it is interpreted as part of the expandable string).
* Quotation marks (`'` and `"`) begin string values
* Parentheses (`(` and `)`) demarcate new expressions.
* Subexpression operator (`$(`â€¦`)`) demarcates embedded expressions.
* Braces (`{` and `}`) demarcate new script blocks.
* Initial at sign (`@`) begins expression syntaxes such as splatting (`@args`), 
arrays (`@(1,2,3)`) and hash tables (`@{a=1;b=2}`).

The following table provides several examples of values processed in
expression mode and argument mode and the evaluation of those
values.  We assume that the value of the variable `a` is `4`.

|       Example        |    Mode    |      Result       |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| `2`                  | Expression | 2 (integer)       |
| `` `2``              | Expression | "2" (command)     |
| `echo 2`             | Expression | 2 (integer)       |
| `2+2`                | Expression | 4 (integer)       |
| `echo 2+2`           | Argument   | "2+2" (string)    |
| `echo(2+2)`          | Expression | 4 (integer)       |
| `$a`                 | Expression | 4 (integer)       |
| `echo $a`            | Expression | 4 (integer)       |
| `$a+2`               | Expression | 6 (integer)       |
| `echo $a+2`          | Argument   | 4+2 (string)      |
| `$-`                 | Argument   | "$-" (command)    |
| `echo $-`            | Argument   | "$-" (string)     |
| `a$a`                | Expression | "a$a" (command)   |
| `echo a$a`           | Argument   | "a4" (string)     |
| `a'$a'`              | Expression | "a$a" (command)   |
| `echo a'$a'`         | Argument   | "a$a" (string)    |
| `a"$a"`              | Expression | "a$a" (command)   |
| `echo a"$a"`         | Argument   | "a4" (string)     |
| `a$(2)`              | Expression | "a$(2)" (command) |
| `echo a$(2)`         | Argument   | "a2" (string)     |

Every token can be interpreted as some kind of object type, such as Boolean
or string. PowerShell attempts to determine the object type from the
expression. The object type depends on the type of parameter a command
expects and on whether PowerShell knows how to convert the argument to the
correct type. The following table shows several examples of the types
assigned to values returned by the expressions.

|       Example       |    Mode    |     Result      |
| ------------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| `Write-Output !1`   | argument   | "!1" (string)   |
| `Write-Output (!1)` | expression | False (Boolean) |
| `Write-Output (2)`  | expression | 2 (integer)     |

The stop-parsing symbol (`--%`), introduced in PowerShell 3.0, directs
PowerShell to refrain from interpreting input as PowerShell commands or
expressions.

When calling an executable program in PowerShell, place the stop-parsing
symbol before the program arguments. This technique is much easier than
using escape characters to prevent misinterpretation.

When it encounters a stop-parsing symbol, PowerShell treats the remaining
characters in the line as a literal. The only interpretation it performs is to
substitute values for environment variables that use standard Windows notation,
such as `%USERPROFILE%`.

The stop-parsing symbol is effective only until the next newline or pipeline
character. You cannot use a continuation character (`` ` ``) to extend its
effect or use a command delimiter (`;`) to terminate its effect.

For example, the following command calls the **Icacls** program.

```powershell
icacls X:\VMS /grant Dom\HVAdmin:(CI)(OI)F
```

To run this command in PowerShell 2.0, you must use escape characters to
prevent PowerShell from misinterpreting the parentheses.

```powershell
icacls X:\VMS /grant Dom\HVAdmin:`(CI`)`(OI`)F
```

Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, you can use the stop-parsing symbol.

```powershell
icacls X:\VMS --% /grant Dom\HVAdmin:(CI)(OI)F
```

PowerShell sends the following command string to the Icacls program:

`X:\VMS /grant Dom\HVAdmin:(CI)(OI)F`

> [!NOTE]
> The stop-parsing symbol only intended for use on Windows platforms.
