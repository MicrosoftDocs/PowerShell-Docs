# About For

## SHORT DESCRIPTION
Describes a language command you can use to run statements based on a
conditional test.

## LONG DESCRIPTION
The For statement (also known as a For loop) is a language construct you
can use to create a loop that runs commands in a command block while a
specified condition evaluates to true.

A typical use of the For loop is to iterate an array of values and to
operate on a subset of these values. In most cases, if you want to iterate
all the values in an array, consider using a Foreach statement.

### Syntax
The following shows the For statement syntax.

```powershell
for (<init>; <condition>; <repeat>)
{<statement list>}
```

The &lt;init&gt; placeholder represents one or more commands, separated by
commas, that are run before the loop begins. You typically use the
&lt;init&gt; portion of the statement to create and initialize a variable
with a starting value. Note that the comma syntax doesn't work with
assignment statements, such as the following example:

```powershell
$ofs=",";$rs = "rs"; $cs = "cs"; for ($r = $rs, $c = $cs; $true;)
{ "r is '$r' and c is '$c'"; break }
```

This variable will then be the basis for the condition to be tested in the
next portion of the For statement.

The &lt;condition&gt; placeholder represents the portion of the For
statement that resolves to a true or false Boolean value. Windows
PowerShell evaluates the condition each time the For loop runs. If the
statement is true, the commands in the command block run, and the statement
is evaluated again. If the condition is still true, the commands in the
statement list run again. The loop is repeated until the condition becomes
false.

The &lt;repeat&gt; placeholder represents one or more commands, separated
by commas, that are executed each time the loop repeats. Typically, this is
used to modify a variable that is tested inside the &lt;condition&gt; part
of the statement.

The &lt;statement list&gt; placeholder represents a set of one or more
commands that are run each time the loop is entered or repeated. The
contents of the statement list are surrounded by braces.

### Examples

At a minimum, a For statement requires the parenthesis surrounding the
&lt;init&gt;, &lt;condition&gt;, and &lt;repeat&gt; part of the statement
and a command surrounded by braces in the &lt;statement list&gt; part of
the statement.

Note that the upcoming examples intentionally show code outside the For
statement. In later examples, code is integrated into the for statement.

For example, the following For statement continually displays the value of
the $i variable until you manually break out of the command by pressing
CTRL+C.

```powershell
$i = 1
for (;;){Write-Host $i}
```

You can add additional commands to the statement list so that the value of
$i is incremented by 1 each time the loop is run, as the following example
shows.

```powershell
for (;;){$i++; Write-Host $i}
```

Until you break out of the command by pressing CTRL+C, this statement will
continually display the value of the $i variable as it is incremented by 1
each time the loop is run.

Rather than change the value of the variable in the statement list part of
the For statement, you can use the &lt;repeat&gt; portion of the For
statement instead, as follows.

```powershell
$i=1
for (;;$i++){Write-Host $i}
```


This statement will still repeat indefinitely until you break out of the
command by pressing CTRL\+C.

By setting a condition (using the &lt;condition&gt; portion of the For
statement), you can end the For loop when the condition evaluates to false.
In the following example, the For loop runs while the value of $i is less
than or equal to 10.

```powershell
$i=1
for(;$i -le 10;$i++){Write-Host $i}
```


Instead of creating and initializing the variable outside the For
statement, you can perform this task inside the For loop by using the
&lt;init&gt; portion of the For statement.

```powershell
for($i=1; $i -le 10; $i++){Write-Host $i}
```


You can use carriage returns instead of semicolons to delimit the
&lt;init&gt;, &lt;condition&gt;, and &lt;repeat&gt; portions of the For
statement. The following example shows the For statement syntax in this
alternative form.


```powershell
for (<init>
  <condition>
  <repeat>){
  <statement list>
}
```

This alternative form of the For statement works in PowerShell script files
and at the PowerShell command prompt. However, it is easier to use
the For statement syntax with semicolons when you enter interactive
commands at the command prompt.

The For loop is more flexible than the Foreach loop because it allows you
to increment values in an array or collection by using patterns. In the
following example, the $i variable is incremented by 2 in the
&lt;repeat&gt; portion of the for statement.


```powershell
for ($i = 0; $i -ile 20; $i += 2) {Write-Host $i}
```
