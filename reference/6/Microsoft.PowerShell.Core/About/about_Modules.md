# About Modules

## Short Description

Explains how to install, import, and use PowerShell modules.

## Long Description

A module is a package that contains PowerShell commands, such as cmdlets,
providers, functions, workflows, variables, and aliases.

People who write commands can use modules to organize their commands and share
them with others. People who receive modules can add the commands in the
modules to their PowerShell sessions and use them just like the built-in
commands.

This topic explains how to use PowerShell modules. For information about how
to write PowerShell modules, see [Writing a PowerShell Module](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=144916)
in the MSDN library.

## What Is a Module?

A module is a package of commands. All cmdlets and providers in your session
are added by a module or a snap-in.

## Module Auto-Loading

Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, PowerShell imports modules automatically the
first time that you run any command in an installed module. You can now use
the commands in a module without any set-up or profile configuration, so
there's no need to manage modules after you install them on your computer.

The commands in a module are also easier to find. The `Get-Command` cmdlet now
gets all commands in all installed modules, even if they are not yet in the
session, so you can find a command and use it without importing.

Any of the following commands will import a module into your session.
### Run the Command

```powershell
Get-Mailbox -Identity Chris
```

### Get the Command

```powershell
Get-Command Get-Mailbox
```

### Get Help for the Command

```powershell
Get-Help Get-Mailbox
```

`Get-Command` commands that include a wildcard character (*) are considered
to be for discovery, not use, and do not import any modules.

Only modules that are stored in the location specified by the PSModulePath
environment variable are automatically imported. Modules in other locations
must be imported by running the `Import-Module` cmdlet.

Also, commands that use PowerShell providers do not automatically
import a module. For example, if you use a command that requires the WSMan:
drive, such as the `Get-PSSessionConfiguration` cmdlet, you might need to
run the `Import-Module` cmdlet to import the Microsoft.WSMan.Management
module that includes the WSMan: drive.

You can still run the `Import-Module` command to import a module and
use the $PSModuleAutoloadingPreference variable to enable, disable and
configure automatic importing of modules. For more information, see
[about_Preference_Variables](about_Preference_Variables.md).

## How to Use a Module

To use a module, perform the following tasks:

1. Install the module. (This is often done for you.)
2. Find the commands that the module added.
3. Use the commands that the module added.

This topic explains how to perform these tasks. It also includes
other useful information about managing modules.

## How to Install a Module

If you receive a module as a folder with files in it, you need to install it
on your computer before you can use it in PowerShell.

Most modules are installed for you. PowerShell comes with several preinstalled
modules, sometimes called the "core" modules. On Windows-based computers, if
features that are included with the operating system have cmdlets to manage
them, those modules are preinstalled. When you install a Windows feature, by
using, for example, the Add Roles and Features Wizard in Server Manager, or
the Turn Windows features on or off dialog box in Control Panel, any
PowerShell modules that are part of the feature are installed. Many other
modules come in an installer or Setup program that installs the module.


Create a Modules directory for the current user if one does not exist. To
create a Modules directory, type:

```powershell
New-Item -Type Directory -Path $HOME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules
```

Copy the entire module folder into the Modules directory. You can use any
method to copy the folder, including Windows Explorer and Cmd.exe, as well as
PowerShell. In PowerShell use the `Copy-Item` cmdlet. For example, to copy the
MyModule folder from C:\\ps-test\\MyModule to the Modules directory, type:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Path C:\ps-test\MyModule -Destination `
    $HOME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules
```

You can install a module in any location, but installing your modules in a
default module location makes them easier to manage. For more information
about the default module locations, see the "Module and DSC Resource
Locations, and PSModulePath" section.

## How to Find Installed Modules

To find modules that are installed in a default module location,
but not yet imported into your session, type:

```powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable
```

To find the modules that have already been imported into your session,
at the PowerShell prompt, type:

```powershell
Get-Module
```

For more information about the `Get-Module` cmdlet, see
[Get-Module](../Get-Module.md).

## How to Find the Commands in a Module

Use the `Get-Command` cmdlet to find all available commands. You can use the
parameters of the `Get-Command` cmdlet to filter commands such as by module,
name, and noun.

To find all commands in a module, type:

```powershell
Get-Command -Module <module-name>
```

For example, to find the commands in the BitsTransfer module, type:

```powershell
Get-Command -Module BitsTransfer
```

For more information about the `Get-Command` cmdlet, see
[Get-Command](../Get-Command.md).

## How to Get Help for the Commands in a Module

If the module contains Help files for the commands that it exports, the
`Get-Help` cmdlet will display the Help topics. Use the same `Get-Help`
command format that you would use to get help for any command in PowerShell.

Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, you can download Help files for a module and
download updates to the Help files so they are never obsolete.

To get help for a commands in a module, type:

```powershell
Get-Help <command-name>
```

To get help online for command in a module, type:

```powershell
Get-Help <command-name> -Online
```

To download and install the help files for the commands in a module, type:

```powershell
Update-Help -Module <module-name>
```

For more information, see [Get-Help](../Get-Help.md) and
[Update-Help](../Update-Help.md).

## How to Import a Module

You might have to import a module or import a module file. Importing is
required when a module is not installed in the locations specified by the
PSModulePath environment variable ($env:PSModulePath), or the module consists
of file, such as a .dll or .psm1 file, instead of typical module that is
delivered as a folder.

You might also choose to import a module so that you can use the parameters of
the `Import-Module` command, such as the Prefix parameter, which adds a
distinctive prefix to the noun names of all imported commands, or the
**NoClobber** parameter, which prevents the module from adding commands that
would hide or replace existing commands in the session.

To import modules, use the `Import-Module` cmdlet.

To import modules in a PSModulePath location into the current session, use the
following command format.

```powershell
Import-Module <module-name>
```

For example, the following command imports the BitsTransfer module
into the current session.

```powershell
Import-Module BitsTransfer
```

To import a module that is not in a default module location, use
the fully qualified path to the module folder in the command.

For example, to add the TestCmdlets module in the C:\ps-test directory
to your session, type:

```powershell
Import-Module C:\ps-test\TestCmdlets
```

To import a module file that is not contained in a module folder, use
the fully qualified path to the module file in the command.

For example, to add the TestCmdlets.dll module in the C:\ps-test directory
to your session, type:

```powershell
Import-Module C:\ps-test\TestCmdlets.dll
```

For more information about adding modules to your session, see
[Import-Module](../Import-Module.md).

## How to Import a Module into Every Session

The `Import-Module` command imports modules into your current Windows
PowerShell session. This command affects only the current session.

To import a module into every PowerShell session that you
start, add the `Import-Module` command to your PowerShell
profile.

For more information about profiles, see [about_Profiles](about_Profiles.md).

## How to Remove a Module

When you remove a module, the commands that the module added are deleted
from the session.

To remove a module from your session, use the following command
format.

```powershell
Remove-Module <module-name>
```

For example, the following command removes the BitsTransfer module
from the current session.

```powershell
Remove-Module BitsTransfer
```

Removing a module reverses the operation of importing a module. Removing
a module does not uninstall the module. For more information about the
`Remove-Module` cmdlet, see [Remove-Module](../Remove-Module.md).

## Module and DSC Resource Locations, and PSModulePath

The following are default locations for PowerShell modules. Starting in
PowerShell 4.0, with the introduction of DSC, a new default module and DSC
resource folder was introduced. For more information about DSC, see
about_DesiredStateConfiguration.

- System: $pshome\Modules (%windir%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules)
  System modules are those that ship with Windows and PowerShell.

  Starting in PowerShell 4.0, when PowerShell Desired State Configuration
  (DSC) was introduced, DSC resources that are included with PowerShell are
  also stored in \$pshome\\Modules, in the
  \$pshome\\Modules\\PSDesiredStateConfiguration\\DSCResources folder.

- Current user: \$home\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules
  (%UserProfile%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules)

  or

  \$home\\My Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules
  (%UserProfile%\My Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules)
  This is the location for user-added modules prior to PowerShell 4.0.

In PowerShell 4.0 and later releases of PowerShell, user-added modules and DSC
resources are stored in C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules. Modules
and DSC resources in this location are accessible by all users of the
computer. This change was required because the DSC engine runs as local
system, and could not access user-specific paths, such as
\$home\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules.

Starting in PowerShell 5.0, with the addition of the PowerShellGet module, and
the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com) of community- and
Microsoft-created resources, the `Install-Module` command installs modules and
DSC resources to C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules by default.

Note: To add or change files in the %Windir%\\System32 directory, start
PowerShell with the "Run as administrator" option.

You can change the default module locations on your system by changing the
value of the PSModulePath environment variable ($Env:PSModulePath). The
PSModulePath environment variable is modeled on the Path environment variable
and has the same format.

To view the default module locations, type:

```powershell
$Env:PSModulePath
```

To add a default module location on Windows, use the following command format:

```powershell
$Env:PSModulePath += ";<path>"
```

The semicolon (;) in the command separates the new path from the
path that precedes it in the list.

For example, to add the "C:\ps-test\Modules" directory, type:

```powershell
$Env:PSModulePath += ";C:\ps-test\Modules"
```

To add a default module location on Linux or MacOS, use the following command format:

```powershell
$Env:PSModulePath += ":<path>"
```

For example, to add the "/usr/local/Fabrikam/Modules" directory to
the value of the PSModulePath environment variable, type:

```powershell
$Env:PSModulePath += ":/usr/local/Fabrikam/Modules"
```

On Linux or MacOS, the colon (:) in the command separates the new path from the path that
precedes it in the list.

When you add a path to PSModulePath, `Get-Module` and `Import-Module`
commands include modules in that path.

The value that you set affects only the current session. To make the change
persistent, add the command to your PowerShell profile. Alternatively, on
Windows, you can use System in Control Panel to change the value of the
PSModulePath environment variable, or you can use the
SetEnvironmentVariable method of the System.Environment class to add
a path to the PSModulePath environment variable.

For more information about the PSModulePath variable, see
[about_Environment_Variables](about_Environment_Variables.md).

## Modules and Name Conflicts

Name conflicts occur when more than one command in the session has the same
name. Importing a module causes a name conflict when commands in the module
have the same names as commands or items in the session.

Name conflicts can result in commands being hidden or replaced.

### Hidden

A command is hidden when it is not the command that runs when you type the
command name, but you can run it by using another method, such as by
qualifying the command name with the name of the module or snap-in in which it
originated.

### Replaced

A command is replaced when you cannot run it because it has been overwritten
by a command with the same name. Even when you remove the module that caused
the conflict, you cannot run a replaced command unless you restart the
session.

`Import-Module` might add commands that hide and replace commands in the
current session. Also, commands in your session can hide commands that
the module added.

To detect name conflicts, use the **All** parameter of the `Get-Command`
cmdlet. Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, `Get-Command` gets only that commands
that run when you type the command name. The **All** parameter gets all
commands with the specific name in the session.

To prevent name conflicts, use the **NoClobber** or **Prefix** parameters of
the `Import-Module` cmdlet. The **Prefix** parameter adds a prefix to the
names of imported commands so that they are unique in the session. The
**NoClobber** parameter does not import any commands that would hide or
replace existing commands in the session.

You can also use the **Alias**, **Cmdlet**, **Function**, and **Variable**
parameters of `Import-Module` to select only the commands that you want to
import, and you can exclude commands that cause name conflicts in your
session.

Module authors can prevent name conflicts by using the DefaultCommandPrefix
property of the module manifest to add a default prefix to all command names.
The value of the Prefix parameter takes precedence over the value of
DefaultCommandPrefix.

Even if a command is hidden, you can run it by qualifying the command name
with the name of the module or snap-in in which it originated.

The PowerShell command precedence rules determine which command runs when the
session includes commands with the same name.

For example, when a session includes a function and a cmdlet with the same
name, PowerShell runs the function by default. When the session includes
commands of the same type with the same name, such as two cmdlets with the
same name, by default, it runs the most recently added command.

For more information, including an explanation of the precedence rules and
instructions for running hidden commands, see
[about_Command_Precedence](about_Command_Precedence.md).

## Modules and Snap-ins

You can add commands to your session from modules and snap-ins. Modules can
add all types of commands, including cmdlets, providers, and functions, and
items, such as variables, aliases, and PowerShell drives. Snap-ins can add
only cmdlets and providers.

Before removing a module or snap-in from your session, use the following
commands to determine which commands will be removed.

To find the source of a cmdlet in your session, use the following command
format:

```powershell
Get-Command <cmdlet-name> | Format-List -Property verb,noun,pssnapin,module
```

For example, to find the source of the `Get-Date` cmdlet, type:

```powershell
Get-Command Get-Date | Format-List -Property verb,noun,module
```

## Module-related Warnings and Errors

The commands that a module exports should follow the PowerShell command naming
rules. If the module that you import exports cmdlets or functions that have
unapproved verbs in their names, the `Import-Module` cmdlet displays the
following warning message.

WARNING: Some imported command names include unapproved verbs which might make
them less discoverable. Use the Verbose parameter for more detail or type
`Get-Verb` to see the list of approved verbs.

This message is only a warning. The complete module is still imported,
including the non-conforming commands. Although the message is displayed to
module users, the naming problem should be fixed by the module author.

To suppress the warning message, use the **DisableNameChecking** parameter of
the `Import-Module` cmdlet.

## Built-in Modules and Snap-ins

In PowerShell 2.0 and in older-style host programs in PowerShell 3.0 and
later, the core commands that are installed with PowerShell are packaged in
snap-ins that are added automatically to every PowerShell session.

Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, for host programs that implement the
`InitialSessionState.CreateDefault2` initial session state API the
Microsoft.PowerShell.Core snap-in is added to every session by default.
Modules are loaded automatically on first-use.

NOTE: Remote sessions, including sessions that are started by using the
`New-PSSession` cmdlet, are older-style sessions in which the built-in
commands are packaged in snap-ins.

The following modules (or snap-ins) are installed with PowerShell.
* CimCmdlets
* Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive
* Microsoft.PowerShell.Core
* Microsoft.PowerShell.Diagnostics
* Microsoft.PowerShell.Host
* Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
* Microsoft.PowerShell.Security
* Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
* Microsoft.WSMan.Management
* PackageManagement
* PowerShellGet
* PSDesiredStateConfiguration
* PSDiagnostics
* PSReadline
