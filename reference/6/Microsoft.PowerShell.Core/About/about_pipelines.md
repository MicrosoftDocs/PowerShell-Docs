# About Pipelines

## Short Description
Combining commands into pipelines in the PowerShell

## Long Description

A pipeline is a series of commands connected by pipeline operators (`|`)
(ASCII 124). Each pipeline operator sends the results of the preceding command
to the next command.

You can use pipelines to send the objects that are output by one command to be
used as input to another command for processing. And you can send the output
of that command to yet another command. The result is a very powerful command
chain or "pipeline" that is comprised of a series of simple commands.

For example,

```powershell
Command-1 | Command-2 | Command-3
```

In this example, the objects that `Command-1` emits are sent to `Command-2`.
`Command-2` processes the objects and sends them to `Command-3`. `Command-3`
processes the objects and send them down the pipeline. Because there are no
more commands in the pipeline, the results are displayed at the console.

In a pipeline, the commands are processed from left to right in the order that
they appear. The processing is handled as a single operation and output is
displayed as it is generated.

Here is a simple example. The following command gets the Notepad process and
then stops it.

For example,
```powershell
Get-Process notepad | Stop-Process
```

The first command uses the `Get-Process` cmdlet to get an object representing
the Notepad process. It uses a pipeline operator (`|`) to send the process
object to the `Stop-Process` cmdlet, which stops the Notepad process. Notice
that the `Stop-Process` command does not have a Name or ID parameter to
specify the process, because the specified process is submitted through the
pipeline.

Here is a practical example. This command pipeline gets the text files in the
current directory, selects only the files that are more than 10,000 bytes
long, sorts them by length, and displays the name and length of each file in a
table.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path *.txt | Where-Object {$_.length -gt 10000} |
Sort-Object -Property length | Format-Table -Property name, length
```

This pipeline is comprised of four commands in the specified order. The
command is written horizontally, but we will show the process vertically in
the following graphic.

`Get-ChildItem` `-Path` *.txt

```
|
|   (FileInfo objects for *.txt)
|
V
```

`Where-Object` {$_.length `-gt` 10000}

```
|
|   (FileInfo objects for *.txt)
|   (     Length > 10000       )
|
V
```

`Sort-Object` `-Property` Length

```
|
|   (FileInfo objects for *.txt)
|   (     Length > 10000       )
|   (    Sorted by length      )
|
V
```

`Format-Table` `-Property` name, length

```
|
|   (FileInfo objects for *.txt)
|   (     Length > 10000       )
|   (    Sorted by length      )
|   (  Formatted in a table    )
|
V
```

```output
Name                       Length
----                       ------
tmp1.txt                    82920
tmp2.txt                   114000
tmp3.txt                   114000
```

## Using Pipelines

The PowerShell cmdlets were designed to be used in pipelines. For example, you
can usually pipe the results of a Get cmdlet to an action cmdlet (such as a
Set, Start, Stop, or Rename cmdlet) for the same noun.

For example, you can pipe any service from the `Get-Service` cmdlet to the
`Start-Service` or `Stop-Service` cmdlets (although disabled services cannot
be restarted in this way).

This command pipeline starts the WMI service on the computer:

For example,
```powershell
Get-Service wmi | Start-Service
```

The cmdlets that get and set objects of the PowerShell providers, such as the
Item and ItemProperty cmdlets, are also designed to be used in pipelines.

For example, you can pipe the results of a `Get-Item` or `Get-ChildItem`
command in the PowerShell registry provider to the `New-ItemProperty` cmdlet.
This command adds a new registry entry, NoOfEmployees, with a value of 8124,
to the MyCompany registry key.

For example,
```powershell
Get-Item -Path HKLM:\Software\MyCompany |
  New-ItemProperty -Name NoOfEmployees -Value 8124
```

Many of the utility cmdlets, such as `Get-Member`, `Where-Object`,
`Sort-Object`, `Group-Object`, and `Measure-Object` are used almost
exclusively in pipelines. You can pipe any objects to these cmdlets.

For example, you can pipe all of the processes on the computer to the
`Sort-Object` command and have them sorted by the number of handles in the
process.

For example,

```powershell
Get-Process | Sort-Object -Property handles
```

Also, you can pipe any objects to the formatting cmdlets, such as
`Format-List` and `Format-Table`, the Export cmdlets, such as `Export-Clixml`
and `Export-CSV`, and the Out cmdlets, such as `Out-Printer`.

For example, you can pipe the Winlogon process to the `Format-List` cmdlet to
display all of the properties of the process in a list.

For example,

```powershell
Get-Process winlogon | Format-List -Property *
```

With a bit of practice, you'll find that combining simple commands into
pipelines saves time and typing, and makes your scripting more efficient.

## How Pipelines Work

When you "pipe" objects, that is send the objects in the output of one command
to another command, PowerShell tries to associate the piped objects with one
of the parameters of the receiving cmdlet.

To do so, the PowerShell "parameter binding" component, which associates input
objects with cmdlet parameters, tries to find a parameter that meets the
following criteria:

- The parameter must accept input from a pipeline (not all do)
- The parameter must accept the type of object being sent or a type that the
  object can be converted to.
- The parameter must not already be used in the command.

For example, the `Start-Service` cmdlet has many parameters, but only two of
them, `-Name` and `-InputObject` accept pipeline input. The `-Name` parameter
takes strings and the `-InputObject` parameter takes service objects.
Therefore, you can pipe strings and service objects (and objects with
properties that can be converted to string and service objects) to
`Start-Service`.

If the parameter binding component of PowerShell cannot associate the piped
objects with a parameter of the receiving cmdlet, the command fails and
PowerShell prompts you for the missing parameter values.

You cannot force the parameter binding component to associate the piped
objects with a particular parameter. You cannot even suggest a parameter.
Instead, the logic of the component manages the piping as efficiently as
possible.

## One-At-A-Time Processing

Piping objects to a command is much like using a parameter of the command to
submit the objects.

For example, piping objects representing the services on the computer to a
`Format-Table` command, such as:

```powershell
Get-Service | Format-Table -Property name, dependentservices
```

is much like saving the service objects in a variable and using the
InputObject parameter of `Format-Table` to submit the service object.

For example,

```powershell
$services = Get-Service
Format-Table -InputObject $services -Property name, dependentservices
```

or imbedding the command in the parameter value

For example,

```powershell
Format-Table -InputObject (Get-Service wmi) -Property name,dependentservices
```

However, there is an important difference. When you pipe multiple objects to a
command, PowerShell sends the objects to the command one at a time. When you
use a command parameter, the objects are sent as a single array object.

This seemingly technical difference can have interesting, and sometimes
useful, consequences.

For example, if you pipe multiple process objects from the `Get-Process`
cmdlet to the `Get-Member` cmdlet, PowerShell sends each process object, one
at a time, to `Get-Member`. `Get-Member` displays the .NET class (type) of the
process objects, and their properties and methods.

NOTE: `Get-Member` eliminates duplicates, so if the objects are all of the
same type, it displays only one object type.

In this case, `Get-Member` displays the properties and methods of each process
object, that is, a System.Diagnostics.Process object.

For example,

```powershell
Get-Process | Get-Member
```

```Output
TypeName: System.Diagnostics.Process

Name      MemberType     Definition
----      ----------     ----------
Handles   AliasProperty  Handles = Handlecount
Name      AliasProperty  Name = ProcessName
NPM       AliasProperty  NPM = NonpagedSystemMemorySize
...
```

However, if you use the InputObject parameter of `Get-Member`, then
`Get-Member` receives an array of System.Diagnostics.Process objects as a
single unit, and it displays the properties of an array of objects. (Note the
array symbol ([]) after the System.Object type name.)

For example,

```powershell
Get-Member -InputObject (Get-Process)
```

```Output
TypeName: System.Object[]

Name               MemberType    Definition
----               ----------    ----------
Count              AliasProperty Count = Length
Address            Method        System.Object& Address(Int32 )
Clone              Method        System.Object Clone()
...
```

This result might not be what you intended, but after you understand it, you
can use it. For example, an array of process objects has a Count property that
you can use to count the number of processes on the computer.

For example,

```powershell
(Get-Process).count
```

This distinction can be important, so remember that when you pipe objects to a
cmdlet, they are delivered one at a time.

## Accepts Pipeline Input

In order to receive objects in a pipeline, the receiving cmdlet must have a
parameter that accepts pipeline input. You can use a `Get-Help` command with
the **Full** or **Parameter** parameters to determine which, if any, of a
cmdlet's parameters accepts pipeline input.

In the `Get-Help` default display, the "Accept pipeline input?" item appears
in a table of parameter attributes. This table is displayed only when you use
the **Full** or **Parameter** parameters of the `Get-Help` cmdlet.

For example, to determine which of the parameters of the `Start-Service`
cmdlet accepts pipeline input, type:

```powershell
Get-Help Start-Service -Full
```

or

```powershell
Get-Help Start-Service -Parameter *
```

For example, the help for the `Start-Service` cmdlet shows that the
**InputObject** and **Name** parameters accept pipeline input ("true"). All
other parameters have a value of "false" in the "Accept pipeline input?" row.

```
-InputObject <ServiceController[]>
Specifies ServiceController objects representing the services to be started.
Enter a variable that contains the objects, or type a command or expression
that gets the objects.

Required?                    true
Position?                    0
Default value                None
Accept pipeline input?       True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters?  false

-Name <String[]>
Specifies the service names for the service to be started.

The parameter name is optional. You can use Name or its alias, ServiceName,
or you can omit the parameter name.

Required?                    true
Position?                    0
Default value                None
Accept pipeline input?       True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters?  false
```

This means that you can send objects (PsObjects) through the pipeline to the
`Where-Object` cmdlet and PowerShell will associate the object with the
**InputObject** and **Name** parameters.

## Methods Of Accepting Pipeline Input

Cmdlets parameters can accept pipeline input in one of two different ways:

- ByValue: Parameters that accept input "by value" can accept piped objects
  that have the same .NET type as their parameter value or objects that can be
  converted to that type.

  For example, the Name parameter of `Start-Service` accepts pipeline input by
  value. It can accept string objects or objects that can be converted to
  strings.

- ByPropertyName: Parameters that accept input "by property name" can accept
  piped objects only when a property of the object has the same name as the
  parameter.

  For example, the Name parameter of `Start-Service` can accept objects that
  have a Name property. To list the properties of an object, pipe it to
  `Get-Member`.

Some parameters can accept objects by value or by property name. These
parameters are designed to take input from the pipeline easily.

## Investigating Pipeline Errors

If a command fails because of a pipeline error, you can investigate the
failure and rewrite the command.

For example, the following command tries to move a registry entry from one
registry key to another by using the `Get-Item` cmdlet to get the destination
path and then piping the path to the `Move-ItemProperty` cmdlet.

Specifically, the command uses the `Get-Item` cmdlet to get the destination
path. It uses a pipeline operator to send the result to the
`Move-ItemProperty` cmdlet. The `Move-ItemProperty` command specifies the
current path and name of the registry entry to be moved.

For example,

```powershell
Get-Item -Path HKLM:\software\mycompany\sales |
Move-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\software\mycompany\design -Name product
```

The command fails and PowerShell displays the following error
message:

```output
Move-ItemProperty : The input object cannot be bound to any parameters for
the command either because the command does not take pipeline input or the
input and its properties do not match any of the parameters that take
pipeline input.
At line:1 char:23
+ $a | Move-ItemProperty <<<<  -Path HKLM:\software\mycompany\design -Name p
```

To investigate, use the `Trace-Command` cmdlet to trace the Parameter Binding
component of PowerShell. The following command traces the Parameter Binding
component while the command is processing. It uses the `-PSHost` parameter to
display the results at the console and the `-filepath` command to send them to
the debug.txt file for later reference.

For example,

```powershell
Trace-Command -Name parameterbinding -Expression {
  Get-Item -Path HKLM:\software\mycompany\sales |
    Move-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\software\mycompany\design -Name product} `
 -PSHost -FilePath debug.txt
```

The results of the trace are lengthy, but they show the values being bound to
the `Get-Item` cmdlet and then the named values being bound to the
`Move-ItemProperty` cmdlet.

```
...

BIND NAMED cmd line args [`Move-ItemProperty`]
BIND arg [HKLM:\software\mycompany\design] to parameter [Path]

...

BIND arg [product] to parameter [Name]

...

BIND POSITIONAL cmd line args [`Move-ItemProperty`]

...
```

Finally, it shows that the attempt to bind the path to the **Destination**
parameter of `Move-ItemProperty` failed.

```
...

BIND PIPELINE object to parameters: [`Move-ItemProperty`]
PIPELINE object TYPE = [Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey]
RESTORING pipeline parameter's original values
Parameter [Destination] PIPELINE INPUT ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName NO CO
ERCION
Parameter [Credential] PIPELINE INPUT ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName NO COE
RCION

...
```

To investigate the failure, use the `Get-Help` cmdlet to view the attributes
of the **Destination** parameter. The following command gets detailed
information about the **Destination** parameter.

```powershell
Get-Help Move-ItemProperty -Parameter Destination
```

The results show that **Destination** takes pipeline input only "by property
name". That is, the piped object must have a property named Destination.

```
-Destination <String>
    Specifies the path to the destination location.

    Required?                    true
    Position?                    1
    Default value                None
    Accept pipeline input?       True (ByPropertyName)
    Accept wildcard characters?  false
```

To see the properties of the object being piped to the `Move-ItemProperty`
cmdlet, pipe it to the `Get-Member` cmdlet. The following command pipes the
results of the first part of the command to the `Get-Member` cmdlet.

For example,

```powershell
Get-Item -Path HKLM:\software\mycompany\sales | Get-Member
```

The output shows that the item is a Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey that does not
have a Destination property. That explains why the command failed.

To fix the command, we must specify the destination in the `Move-ItemProperty`
cmdlet. We can use a `Get-ItemProperty` command to get the path, but the name
and destination must be specified in the `Move-ItemProperty` part of the
command.

For example,

```powershell
Get-Item -Path HKLM:\software\mycompany\design |
Move-ItemProperty -Dest HKLM:\software\mycompany\sales -Name product
```

To verify that the command worked, use a `Get-ItemProperty` command:

For example,
```powershell
Get-Itemproperty HKLM:\software\mycompany\sales
```

The results show that the Product registry entry was moved to the Sales key.

```Output
PSPath       : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\softwa
re\mycompany\sales
PSParentPath : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\softwa
re\mycompany
PSChildName  : sales
PSDrive      : HKLM
PSProvider   : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\Registry
Product      : 18
```
