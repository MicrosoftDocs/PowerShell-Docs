# About ForEach

## SHORT DESCRIPTION

Describes a language command you can use to traverse all the items in a
collection of items.

## LONG DESCRIPTION

The Foreach statement (also known as a Foreach loop) is a language
construct for stepping through (iterating) a series of values in a
collection of items.

The simplest and most typical type of collection to traverse is an array.
Within a Foreach loop, it is common to run one or more commands against
each item in an array.

## Syntax

The following shows the ForEach syntax:

    foreach ($<item> in $<collection>){<statement list>}

### Simplified syntax

Starting in PowerShell 3.0, syntax with language keywords such as Where and
ForEach was simplified. Comparison operators that work on the members of a
collection are treated as parameters. You can use a method on the members
of a collection without containing it in a script block or adding the
automatic variable `$_.`. Consider the following two examples:

```powershell
    dir cert:\ -Recurse | foreach GetKeyAlgorithm
    dir cert:\ -Recurse | foreach {$_.GetKeyAlgorithm()}
```

Although both commands work, the first returns results without using a
script block or the `$_`. automatic variable. The method `GetKeyAlgorithm`
is treated as a parameter of ForEach. The first command returns the same
results, but without errors, because the simplified syntax does not attempt
to return results for items for which the specified argument did not apply.

In this example, the `Get-Process` property `Description` is passed as a
parameter argument of the `ForEach` statement. The results are the
descriptions of active processes.

```powershell
Get-Process | ForEach Description
```

### The `Foreach` statement outside a command pipeline
The part of the `Foreach` statement enclosed in parenthesis represents a
variable and a collection to iterate. PowerShell creates the variable
(`$<item>`) automatically when the `Foreach` loop runs. Prior to each
iteration through the loop, the variable is set to a value in the
collection. The block following a `Foreach` statement `{<statement list>}`
contains a set of commands to execute against each item in a collection.

### Examples
For example, the `Foreach` loop in the following example displays the
values in the `$letterArray` array.

```powershell
$letterArray = "a","b","c","d"
foreach ($letter in $letterArray)
{
    Write-Host $letter
}
```

In this example, the `$letterArray` array is created and initialized with
the string values `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`, and `"d"`. The first time the
`Foreach` statement runs, it sets the `$letter` variable equal to the first
item in `$letterArray` (`"a"`). Then, it uses the `Write-Host` cmdlet to
display the letter a. The next time through the loop, `$letter` is set to
`"b"`, and so on. After the `Foreach` loop displays the letter d, Windows
PowerShell exits the loop.

The entire `Foreach` statement must appear on a single line to run it as a
command at the PowerShell command prompt. The entire `Foreach` statement
does not have to appear on a single line if you place the command in a .ps1
script file instead.

`Foreach` statements can also be used together with cmdlets that return a
collection of items. In the following example, the Foreach statement steps
through the list of items that is returned by the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet.

```powershell
foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem)
{
    Write-Host $file
}
```

You can refine the example by using an `If` statement to limit the results
that are returned. In the following example, the `Foreach` statement
performs the same looping operation as the previous example, but it adds an
`If` statement to limit the results to files that are greater than 100
kilobytes (KB):

```powershell
foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem)
{
    if ($file.length -gt 100KB)
    {
        Write-Host $file
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Foreach` loop uses a property of the `$file` variable
to perform a comparison operation (`$file.length -gt 100KB`). The `$file`
variable contains all the properties in the object that is returned by the
`Get-ChildItem` cmdlet. Therefore, you can return more than just a file
name. In the next example, PowerShell returns the length and the last
access time inside the statement list:

```powershell
foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem)
{
    if ($file.length -gt 100KB)
    {
        Write-Host $file
        Write-Host $file.length
        Write-Host $file.lastaccesstime
    }
}
```

In this example, you are not limited to running a single command in a
statement list.

You can also use a variable outside a `Foreach` loop and increment the
variable inside the loop. The following example counts files over 100 KB in
size:

```powershell
$i = 0
foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem) {
    if ($file.length -gt 100KB) {
        Write-Host $file "file size:" ($file.length / 1024).ToString("F0") KB
        $i = $i + 1
    }
}

if ($i -ne 0) {
    Write-Host
    Write-Host $i " file(s) over 100 KB in the current directory."
}
else {
    Write-Host "No files greater than 100 KB in the current directory."
}
```

In the preceding example, the `$i` variable is set to `0` outside the loop,
and the variable is incremented inside the loop for each file that is found
that is larger than 100 KB. When the loop exits, an `If` statement
evaluates the value of `$i` to display a count of all the files over 100
KB. Or, it displays a message stating that no files over 100 KB were found.

The previous example also demonstrates how to format the file length
results:

```powershell
($file.length / 1024).ToString("F0")
```

The value is divided by 1,024 to show the results in kilobytes rather than
bytes, and the resulting value is then formatted using the fixed-point
format specifier to remove any decimal values from the result. The 0 makes
the format specifier show no decimal places.

### The `Foreach` Statement Inside a Command Pipeline
When `Foreach` appears in a command pipeline, PowerShell uses the `foreach`
alias, which calls the `ForEach-Object` command. When you use the `foreach`
alias in a command pipeline, you do not include the `($<item> in
$<collection>)` syntax as you do with the `Foreach` statement. This is
because the prior command in the pipeline provides this information. The
syntax of the `foreach` alias when used in a command pipeline is as
follows:

    <command> | foreach {<command_block>}

For example, the `Foreach` loop in the following command displays processes
whose working set (memory usage) is greater than 20 megabytes (MB).

The `Get-Process` command gets all of the processes on the computer. The
`Foreach` alias performs the commands in the script block on each process
in sequence.

The `IF` statement selects processes with a working set (WS) greater than
20 megabytes. The `Write-Host` cmdlet writes the name of the process
followed by a colon. It divides the working set value, which is stored in
bytes by 1 megabyte to get the working set value in megabytes. Then it
converts the result from a double to a string. It displays the value as a
fixed point number with zero decimals (F0), a space separator (" "), and
then "MB".

```powershell
Write-Host "Processes with working sets greater than 20 MB."
Get-Process | foreach {
    if ($_.WS -gt 20MB)
    {
        Write-Host $.name ": " ($.WS/1MB).ToString("F0") MB -Separator ""
    }
}
```

The `foreach` alias also supports beginning command blocks, middle command
blocks, and end command blocks. The beginning and end command blocks run
once, and the middle command block runs every time the `Foreach` loop steps
through a collection or array.

The syntax of the `foreach` alias when used in a command pipeline with a
beginning, middle, and ending set of command blocks is as follows:

    <command> | foreach {<beginning command_block>}{<middle command_block>}{<ending command_block>}

The following example demonstrates the use of the beginning, middle, and
end command blocks.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem | foreach {
    $fileCount = $directoryCount = 0
}{
    if ($_.PsIsContainer) {
        $directoryCount++
    } else {
        $fileCount++
    }
}{
    "$directoryCount directories and $fileCount files"
}
```

The beginning block creates and initializes two variables to 0:

```powershell
{$fileCount = $directoryCount = 0}
```

The middle block evaluates whether each item returned by Get-ChildItem
is a directory or a file:

```powershell
{if ($_.PsIsContainer) {$directoryCount++} else {$fileCount++}}
```

If the item that is returned is a directory, the `$directoryCount` variable
is incremented by 1. If the item is not a directory, the `$fileCount`
variable is incremented by 1. The ending block runs after the middle block
completes its looping operation and then returns the results of the
operation:

```powershell
{"$directoryCount directories and $fileCount files"}
```

By using the beginning, middle, and ending command block structure and the
pipeline operator, you can rewrite the earlier example to find any files
that are greater than 100 KB, as follows:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem | foreach {
    $i = 0 } {
    if ($_.length -gt 10KB) {
        Write-Host $_.name "file size:" ($_.length / 1024).ToString("F0") KB
        $i++
    }
} {
    if ($i -ne 0) {
        Write-Host
        Write-Host "$i file(s) over 100 KB in the current directory."
    }
    else {
        Write-Host "No files greater than 100 KB in the current directory."
    }
}
```

The following example, a function which returns the functions that are used
in scripts and script modules, demonstrates how to use the `MoveNext`
method (which works similarly to `skip X` on a `For` loop) and the
`Current` property of the `$foreach` variable inside of a foreach script
block, even if there are unusually- or inconsistently-spaced function
definitions that span multiple lines to declare the function name. The
example also works if there are comments in the functions used in a script
or script module.

```powershell
function Get-FunctionPosition {
  [CmdletBinding()]
  [OutputType('FunctionPosition')]
  param(
    [Parameter(Position = 0, Mandatory, ValueFromPipeline, ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName)]
    [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
    [Alias('PSPath')]
    [System.String[]]
    $Path
  )

  process {
    try {
      $filesToProcess = if ($_ -is [System.IO.FileSystemInfo]) {
        $_
      }
      else {
        Get-Item -Path $Path
      }
      foreach ($item in $filesToProcess) {
        if ($item.PSIsContainer -or $item.Extension -notin @('.ps1', '.psm1')) {
          continue
        }
        $tokens = $errors = $null
        $ast = [System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile($item.FullName, ([REF]$tokens), ([REF]$errors))
        if ($errors) {
          Write-Warning "File '$($item.FullName)' has $($errors.Count) parser errors."
        }
        :tokenLoop foreach ($token in $tokens) {
          if ($token.Kind -ne 'Function') {
              continue
          }
          $position = $token.Extent.StartLineNumber
          do {
            if (-not $foreach.MoveNext()) {
              break tokenLoop
            }
            $token = $foreach.Current
          } until ($token.Kind -in @('Generic', 'Identifier'))
          $functionPosition = [pscustomobject]@{
            Name       = $token.Text
            LineNumber = $position
            Path       = $item.FullName
          }
          Add-Member -InputObject $functionPosition -TypeName FunctionPosition -PassThru
        }
      }
    }
    catch {
      throw
    }
  }
}
```
