# About Core Commands

## SHORT DESCRIPTION

Lists the cmdlets that are designed for use with PowerShell providers.

## LONG DESCRIPTION

PowerShell includes a set of cmdlets that are specifically designed to manage
the items in the data stores that are exposed by PowerShell providers.
You can use these cmdlets in the same ways to manage all the different types
of data that the providers make available to you. For more information about
providers, type "get-help about_providers".

For example, you can use the Get-ChildItem cmdlet to list the files in a file
system directory, the keys under a registry key, or the items that are exposed
by a provider that you write or download.
