# *Variable* provider


## Provider name

 Variable


## Drives

 `Variable:`


## Short description

 Provides access to the PowerShell variables and to their values.


## Detailed description

 The PowerShell **Variable** provider lets you get, add, change, clear, and delete PowerShell variables in the current console.

 The PowerShell **Variable** provider supports the variables that PowerShell creates, including the automatic variables, the preference variables, and the variables that you create.

 The **Variable** provider is a flat namespace that contains only the variable objects. The variables have no child items.

 Most of the variables are instances of the [System.Management.Automation.PSVariable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.psvariable) class. However, there are some variations. For example, the `?` variable is a member of the `QuestionMarkVariable` internal class, and the `MaximumVariableCount` variable is a member of the `SessionStateCapacityVariable` internal class.

 The **Variable** provider exposes its data store in the `Variable:` drive. To work with variables, you can change your location to the `Variable:` drive (`set-location Variable:`), or you can work from any other PowerShell drive. To reference a variable from another location, use the drive name (`Variable:`) in the path.

 PowerShell includes a set of cmdlets designed especially to view and to change variables:

 - [Get-Variable](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Get-Variable.md)
 - [New-Variable](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/New-Variable.md)
 - [Set-Variable](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Set-Variable.md)
 - [Remove-Variable](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Remove-Variable.md)
 - [Clear-Variable](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Clear-Variable.md)

 When you use these cmdlets, you do not need to specify the `Variable:` drive in the name.

 The **Variable** provider supports all of the cmdlets whose names contain the *Item* noun (the `*-Item` cmdlets), except for [Invoke-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Invoke-Item.md). The **Variable** provider supports the [Get-Content](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Content.md) and [Set-Content](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Set-Content.md) cmdlets. However, it does not support the cmdlets whose names contain the *ItemProperty* noun (the `*-ItemProperty` cmdlets), and it does not support the `-Filter` parameter in any cmdlet.

 You can also use the PowerShell expression parser to create, view, and change the values of variables without using the cmdlets. When working with variables directly, use a dollar sign (`$`) to identify the name as a variable and the assignment operator (`=`) to establish and change its value. For example, `$p = Get-Process` creates the `p` variable and stores the results of a `Get-Process` command in it.

 ShouldProcess


## Examples


### Getting to the `Variable:` drive


#### Example 1

 This command changes the current location to the `Variable:` drive. You can use this command from any drive in PowerShell. To return to a file system drive, type the drive name. For example, type `set-location c:`.

```powershell
Set-Location Variable:
```


### Displaying the value of variables


#### Example 1

 This command gets the list of all the variables and their values in the current session. You can use this command from any PowerShell drive.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path Variable:
```


#### Example 2

 This command gets the variables with names that begin with "max". You can use this command from any PowerShell drive.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path Variable:max*
```

 If you are in the `Variable:` drive, you can omit the drive name from the path.


#### Example 3

 This command gets the value of the `WhatIfPreference` variable by typing it at the command line.

 The name of the variable is preceded by a dollar sign (`$`) to indicate that it is a variable. The `Variable:` drive name is not specified.

```powershell
$WhatIfPreference
```


#### Example 4

 This command uses the `-LiteralPath` parameter of [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md) to get the value of the `?` variable from within the `Variable:` drive. [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md) does not attempt to resolve any wildcards in the values of the `-LiteralPath` parameter.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Literalpath ?
```

 To display the value of a variable with a special character name without a cmdlet, type a dollar sign (`$`) and the variable name. For example, to display the value of the `?` variable, type `$?`.


#### Example 5

 This command gets the variables that have the values of `ReadOnly` or `Constant` for their **Options** property.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path Variable: | Where-Object {$_.options -Match "Constant" -or $_.options -Match "ReadOnly"} | Format-List -Property name, value, options
```


### Creating a new variable


#### Example 1

 This command creates the `services` variable and stores the results of a [Get-Service](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Service.md) command in it. Because the current location is in the `Variable:` drive, the value of the `-Path` parameter is a dot (`.`), which represents the current location.

 The parentheses around the [Get-Service](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Service.md) command ensure that the command is executed before the variable is created. Without the parentheses, the value of the new variable is a "Get-Service" string.

```powershell
New-Item -Path . -Name services -Value (Get-Service)
```

 If you are not in the `Variable:` drive, include the `Variable:` drive name in the path.


#### Example 2

 This command creates a `services` variable and stores the result of a [Get-Service](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Service.md) command in it.

 The command uses a dollar sign (`$`) to indicate a variable and the assignment operator (`=`) to assign the result of the [Get-Service](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Service.md) command to the newly created variable.

```powershell
$services = Get-Service
```

 To create a variable without a value, omit the assignment operator.


### Displaying the properties and methods of variables


#### Example 1

 This command uses the Get-Item cmdlet to get all variables. The pipeline operator (`|`) sends the results to the [Get-Member](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Get-Member.md) cmdlet, which displays the methods and properties of the object.

```powershell
Get-Item -Path Variable:* | Get-Member
```

 When you pipe a collection of objects (such as the collection of variables in the `Variable:` drive) to [Get-Member](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Get-Member.md), [Get-Member](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Get-Member.md) evaluates each object in the collection separately and returns information about each of the object types that it finds.
To get information about the collection of objects in the `Variable:` drive, use the `-InputObject` parameter of [Get-Member](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Get-Member.md). For example, `Get-Member -InputObject (Get-Item Variable:*)`. When you use `-InputObject`, [Get-Member](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Get-Member.md) evaluates the collection, not the objects in the collection.


#### Example 2

 This command lists the values of the properties of the `home` variable. It uses the [Get-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Item.md) cmdlet to get an object that represents the `home` variable. The pipeline operator (`|`) sends the results to the [Format-List](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Format-List.md) command. The [Format-List](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Format-List.md) command uses the `-Property` parameter with a wildcard character (`*`) to format and to display the values of all of the properties of the `home` variable.

```powershell
Get-Item Variable:home | Format-List -Property *
```


### Changing the properties of a variable


#### Example 1

 This command uses the [Rename-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Rename-Item.md) cmdlet to change the name of the `a` variable to `processes`.

```powershell
Rename-Item -Path Variable:a -NewName processes
```


#### Example 2

 This command uses the [Set-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Set-Item.md) cmdlet to change the value of the `ErrorActionPreference` variable to "Stop".

```powershell
Set-Item -Path Variable:ErrorActionPreference -Value Stop
```


#### Example 3

 This command changes the value of the `ErrorActionPreference` variable to "Stop".

 It uses a dollar sign (`$`) to indicate a variable and the assignment operator (`=`) to assign the value.

```powershell
$ErrorActionPreference = Stop
```


### Copying a variable


#### Example 1

 This command uses the [Copy-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Copy-Item.md) cmdlet to copy the `processes` variable to `old_processes`. This creates a new variable named `old_processes` that has the same value as the `processes` variable.

```powershell
Copy-Item -Path Variable:processes -Destination Variable:old_processes
```

 If the command is issued from within the `Variable:` drive, you can omit the drive name from the value of the `-Path` parameter.


#### Example 2

 This command copies the `processes` variable to `old_processes` without using a cmdlet. It uses the dollar sign (`$`) to indicate variables and the assignment operator to assign the value of `$processes` to `old_processes`.

```powershell
$old_processes = $processes
```


### Deleting a variable


#### Example 1

 This command deletes the `serv` variable from the current session. You can use this command in any PowerShell drive.

```powershell
Remove-Variable -Path Variable:serv
```


#### Example 2

 This command deletes all variables from the current session except for the variables whose **Options** property has a value of `Constant`. Without the `-Force` parameter, the command does not delete variables whose **Options** property has a value of `ReadOnly`.

```powershell
Remove-Item Variable:* -Force
```


### Setting the value of a variable to NULL


#### Example 1

 This command uses the [Clear-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Clear-Item.md) cmdlet to change the value of the `processes` variable to NULL.

```powershell
Clear-Item -Path Variable:processes
```


#### Example 2

 This command clears the value of the `processes` variable by assigning a null value to it. It uses the `$null` automatic variable to represent the NULL value.

```powershell
$processes = $null
```
