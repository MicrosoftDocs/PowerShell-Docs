## DESCRIPTION

The `Receive-Job` cmdlet gets the results of PowerShell background jobs, such as those started by
using the `Start-Job` cmdlet or the **AsJob** parameter of any cmdlet.
You can get the results of all jobs or identify jobs by their name, ID, instance ID, computer name,
location, or session, or by submitting a job object.

When you start a PowerShell background job, the job starts, but the results do not appear
immediately. Instead, the command returns an object that represents the background job.
The job object contains useful information about the job, but it does not contain the results.
This method lets you continue to work in the session while the job runs.
For more information about background jobs in PowerShell, see [about_Jobs](./About/about_Jobs.md).

The `Receive-Job` cmdlet gets the results that have been generated by the time that the
`Receive-Job` command is submitted.
If the results are not yet complete, you can run additional `Receive-Job` commands to get the
remaining results.

By default, job results are deleted from the system when you receive them, but you can use the
**Keep** parameter to save the results so that you can receive them again.
To delete the job results, run the `Receive-Job` command again without the **Keep** parameter, close
the session, or use the `Remove-Job` cmdlet to delete the job from the session.

Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, `Receive-Job` also gets the results of custom job types, such as
workflow jobs and instances of scheduled jobs.
To enable `Receive-Job` to get the results a custom job type, import the module that supports the
custom job type into the session before it runs a `Receive-Job` command, either by using the
`Import-Module` cmdlet or by using or getting a cmdlet in the module.
For information about a particular custom job type, see the documentation of the custom job type
feature.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get results for a particular job

```powershell
$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-Process}
Receive-Job -Job $job
```

These commands use the **Job** parameter of `Receive-Job` to get the results of a particular job.

The first command starts a job with `Start-Job` and stores the job object in the `$job` variable.

The second command uses the `Receive-Job` cmdlet to get the results of the job.
It uses the **Job** parameter to specify the job.

### Example 2: Use the Keep parameter

```powershell
$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-Service dhcp, fakeservice}
$job | Receive-Job -Keep
```

```Output
Cannot find any service with service name 'fakeservice'.
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (fakeservice:String) [Get-Service], ServiceCommandException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NoServiceFoundForGivenName,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetServiceCommand
    + PSComputerName        : localhost

Status   Name               DisplayName
------   ----               -----------
Running  dhcp               DHCP Client
```

```powershell
$job | Receive-Job -Keep
```

```output
Cannot find any service with service name 'fakeservice'.
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (fakeservice:String) [Get-Service], ServiceCommandException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NoServiceFoundForGivenName,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetServiceCommand
    + PSComputerName        : localhost

Status   Name               DisplayName
------   ----               -----------
Running  dhcp               DHCP Client
```

This example stores a job in the `$job` variable, and pipes the job to the `Receive-Job` cmdlet. The
`-Keep` parameter is also used to allow all aggregated stream data to be retrieved again
after first view.

### Example 3: Get results of several background jobs

When you use the **AsJob** parameter of `Invoke-Command` to start a job, the job object is created
on the local computer, even though the job runs on the remote computers.
As a result, you use local commands to manage the job.

Also, when you use **AsJob**, PowerShell returns one job object that contains a child job for each
job
that was started. In this case, the job object contains three child jobs, one for each job on each
remote computer.

```powershell
# Use the Invoke-Command cmdlet with the -AsJob parameter to start a background job that runs a Get-Service command on three remote computers.
# Store the resulting job object in the $j variable
$j = Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server01, Server02, Server03 -ScriptBlock {Get-Service} -AsJob
# Display the value of the **ChildJobs** property of the job object in $j.
# The display shows that the command created three child jobs, one for the job on each remote computer.
# You could also use the -IncludeChildJobs parameter of the Get-Job cmdlet.
$j.ChildJobs
```

```Output
Id   Name     State      HasMoreData   Location       Command
--   ----     -----      -----------   --------       -------
2    Job2     Completed  True          Server01       Get-Service
3    Job3     Completed  True          Server02       Get-Service
4    Job4     Completed  True          Server03       Get-Service
```

```powershell
# Use the Receive-Job cmdlet to get the results of ust the Job3 child job that ran on the Server02 computer.
# Use the *Keep* parameter to allow you to view the aggregated stream data more than once.
Receive-Job -Name Job3 -Keep
```

```Output
Status  Name        DisplayName                        PSComputerName
------  ----------- -----------                        --------------
Running AeLookupSvc Application Experience             Server02
Stopped ALG         Application Layer Gateway Service  Server02
Running Appinfo     Application Information            Server02
Running AppMgmt     Application Management             Server02
```

### Example 4: Get results of background jobs on multiple remote computers

```powershell
# Use the New-PSSession cmdlet to create three user-managed PSSessions on three servers, and save the sessions in the $s variable.
$s = New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01, Server02, Server03
# Use Invoke-Command run a Start-Job command in each of the PSSessions in the $s variable.
# The job outputs the ComputerName of each server.
# Save the job objects in the $j variable.
$j = Invoke-Command -Session $s -ScriptBlock {Start-Job -ScriptBlock {$env:COMPUTERNAME}}
# To confirm that these job objects are from the remote machines, run Get-Job to show no local jobs running.
Get-Job
```

```Output

```

```powershell
# Display the three job objects in $j.
# Note that the Localhost location is not the local computer, but instead localhost as it relates to the job on each Server.
$j
```

```Output
Id   Name     State      HasMoreData   Location   Command
--   ----     -----      -----------   --------   -------
1    Job1     Completed  True          Localhost  $env:COMPUTERNAME
2    Job2     Completed  True          Localhost  $env:COMPUTERNAME
3    Job3     Completed  True          Localhost  $env:COMPUTERNAME
```

```powershell
# Use Invoke-Command to run a Receive-Job command in each of the sessions in the $s variable and save the results in the $Results variable.
# The Receive-Job command must be run in each session because the jobs were run locally on each server.
$results = Invoke-Command -Session $s -ScriptBlock {Receive-Job -Job $Using:j}
```

```Output
Server01
Server02
Server03
```

This example shows how to get the results of background jobs run on three remote computers.
Unlike the previous example, using `Invoke-Command` to run the `Start-Job` command actually
started three independent jobs on each of the three computers. As a result, the command returned
three job objects representing three jobs run locally on three different computers.

> [!NOTE]
> In the last command, because `$j` is a local variable, the script block uses the **Using** scope
> modifier to identify the `$j` variable. For more information about the **Using** scope modifier,
> see [about_Remote_Variables](./About/about_Remote_Variables.md).

### Example 5: Access child jobs

The `-Keep` parameter preserves the state of the aggregated streams of a job so that it
can be viewed again. Without this parameter all aggregated stream data is erased when the job
is received. For more information, see [about_Job_Details](About/about_Job_Details.md#child-jobs)

> [!NOTE]
> The aggregated streams include the streams of all child jobs. You can still reach the individual
> streams of data through the job object and child job objects.

```powershell
Start-Job -Name TestJob -ScriptBlock {dir C:\, Z:\}
# Without the Keep parameter, aggregated child job data is displayed once.
# Then destroyed.
Receive-Job -Name TestJob
```

```output
    Directory: C:\

## PARAMETERS

### -AutoRemoveJob

Indicates that this cmdlet deletes the job after it returns the job results.
If the job has more results, the job is still deleted, but `Receive-Job` displays a message.

This parameter works only on custom job types.
It is designed for instances of job types that save the job or the type outside of the session, such
as instances of scheduled jobs.

This parameter cannot be used without the **Wait** parameter.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ComputerName

Specifies an array of names of computers.

This parameter selects from among the job results that are stored on the local computer.
It does not get data for jobs run on remote computers.
To get job results that are stored on remote computers, use the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet to run a
`Receive-Job` command remotely.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: ComputerName
Aliases: Cn

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force

Indicates that this cmdlet continues waiting if jobs are in the **Suspended** or **Disconnected**
state. By default, the **Wait** parameter of `Receive-Job` returns, or terminates the wait, when
jobs are in one of the following states:

- Completed
- Failed
- Stopped
- Suspended
- Disconnected.

The **Force** parameter is valid only when the **Wait** parameter is also used in the command.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Id

Specifies an array of IDs.
This cmdlet gets the results of jobs with the specified IDs.

The ID is an integer that uniquely identifies the job in the current session.
It is easier to remember and type than the instance ID, but it is unique only in the current
session. You can type one or more IDs separated by commas.
To find the ID of a job, use `Get-Job`.

```yaml
Type: Int32[]
Parameter Sets: SessionIdParameterSet
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InstanceId

Specifies an array of instance IDs.
This cmdlet gets the results of jobs with the specified instance IDs.

An instance ID is a GUID that uniquely identifies the job on the computer.
To find the instance ID of a job, use the `Get-Job` cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: Guid[]
Parameter Sets: InstanceIdParameterSet
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Job

Specifies the job for which results are being retrieved.

Enter a variable that contains the job or a command that gets the job.
You can also pipe a job object to `Receive-Job`.

```yaml
Type: Job[]
Parameter Sets: Location, ComputerName, Session
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Keep

Indicates that this cmdlet saves the aggregated stream data in the system, even after you have
received them. By default, aggregated stream data is erased after viewed with `Receive-Job`.

Closing the session, or removing the job with the `Remove-Job` cmdlet also deletes aggregated
stream data.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Location

Specifies an array of locations.
This cmdlet gets only the results of jobs in the specified locations.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: Location
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name

Specifies an array of friendly names.
This cmdlet gets the results of jobs that have the specified names.
Wildcard characters are supported.


```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: NameParameterSet
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NoRecurse

Indicates that this cmdlet gets results only from the specified job.
By default, `Receive-Job` also gets the results of all child jobs of the specified job.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Session

Specifies an array of sessions.
This cmdlet gets the results of jobs that were run in the specified PowerShell session
(**PSSession**).
Enter a variable that contains the **PSSession** or a command that gets the **PSSession**, such as a
`Get-PSSession` command.

```yaml
Type: PSSession[]
Parameter Sets: Session
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Wait

Indicates that this cmdlet suppresses the command prompt until all job results are received.
By default, `Receive-Job` immediately returns the available results.

By default, the **Wait** parameter waits until the job is in one of the following states:

- Completed
- Failed
- Stopped
- Suspended
- Disconnected.

To direct the **Wait** parameter to continue waiting if the job state is Suspended or Disconnected,
use the **Force** parameter together with the **Wait** parameter.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WriteEvents

Indicates that this cmdlet reports changes in the job state while it waits for the job to finish.

This parameter is valid only when the **Wait** parameter is used in the command and the **Keep**
parameter is omitted.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WriteJobInResults

Indicates that this cmdlet returns the job object followed by the results.

This parameter is valid only when the **Wait** parameter is used in the command and the **Keep**
parameter is omitted.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
