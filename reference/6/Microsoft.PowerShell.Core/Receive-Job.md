## DESCRIPTION
The **Receive-Job** cmdlet gets the results of PowerShell background jobs, such as those started by using the Start-Job cmdlet or the *AsJob* parameter of any cmdlet.
You can get the results of all jobs or identify jobs by their name, ID, instance ID, computer name, location, or session, or by submitting a job object.

When you start a PowerShell background job, the job starts, but the results do not appear immediately.
Instead, the command returns an object that represents the background job.
The job object contains useful information about the job, but it does not contain the results.
This method lets you continue to work in the session while the job runs.
For more information about background jobs in PowerShell, see about_Jobs.

The **Receive-Job** cmdlet gets the results that have been generated by the time that the **Receive-Job** command is submitted.
If the results are not yet complete, you can run additional **Receive-Job** commands to get the remaining results.

By default, job results are deleted from the system when you receive them, but you can use the *Keep* parameter to save the results so that you can receive them again.
To delete the job results, run the **Receive-Job** command again without the *Keep* parameter, close the session, or use the Remove-Job cmdlet to delete the job from the session.

Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, **Receive-Job** also gets the results of custom job types, such as workflow jobs and instances of scheduled jobs.
To enable **Receive-Job** to get the results a custom job type, import the module that supports the custom job type into the session before it runs a **Receive-Job** command, either by using the Import-Module cmdlet or by using or getting a cmdlet in the module.
For information about a particular custom job type, see the documentation of the custom job type feature.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get results for a particular job
```
PS C:\> $job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-Process}
PS C:\> Receive-Job -Job $job
```

These commands use the *Job* parameter of **Receive-Job** to get the results of a particular job.

The first command uses the Start-Job cmdlet to start a job that runs a Get-Process command.
The command uses the assignment operator (=) to save the resulting job object in the $job variable.

The second command uses the **Receive-Job** cmdlet to get the results of the job.
It uses the *Job* parameter to specify the job.

### Example 2: Get results for a particular job by using the pipeline
```
PS C:\> $job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-Process}
PS C:\> $job | Receive-Job
```

This example is the same as the previous example, except that the command uses a pipeline operator (|) to send the job object to **Receive-Job**.
As a result, the command does not need a *Job* parameter to specify the job.

### Example 3: Get results of several background jobs
```
The first command uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet to start a background job that runs a Get-Service command on three remote computers. The command uses the *AsJob* parameter to run the command as a background job. The command saves the resulting job object in the $j variable.When you use the *AsJob* parameter of **Invoke-Command** to start a job, the job object is created on the local computer, even though the job runs on the remote computers. As a result, you use local commands to manage the job.Also, when you use *AsJob*, PowerShell returns one job object that contains a child job for each job that was started. In this case, the job object contains three child jobs, one for each job on each remote computer.


PS C:\> $j = Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server01, Server02, Server03 -ScriptBlock {Get-Service} -AsJob

The second command uses the dot method to display the value of the **ChildJobs** property of the job object in $j. The display shows that the command created three child jobs, one for the job on each remote computer.
PS C:\> $j.ChildJobs

Id   Name     State      HasMoreData   Location       Command
--   ----     -----      -----------   --------       -------
2    Job2     Completed  True          Server01       Get-Service
3    Job3     Completed  True          Server02       Get-Service
4    Job4     Completed  True          Server03       Get-Service

The third command uses the **Receive-Job** cmdlet to get the results of the Job3 child job that ran on the Server02 computer. It uses the *Name* parameter to specify the name of the child job and the *Keep* parameter to save the job results even after they are received.
PS C:\> Receive-Job -Name Job3 -Keep

Status  Name        DisplayName                        PSComputerName
------  ----------- -----------                        --------------
Running AeLookupSvc Application Experience             Server02
Stopped ALG         Application Layer Gateway Service  Server02
Running Appinfo     Application Information            Server02
Running AppMgmt     Application Management             Server02
```

These commands get the results of one of several background jobs run on remote computers.

### Example 4: Get results of background jobs on multiple remote computers
```
The first command uses the New-PSSession cmdlet to create three user-managed sessions (**PSSessions**), one on each of the servers specified in the command. It saves the sessions in the $s variable.
PS C:\> $s = new-pssession -computername Server01, Server02, Server03

The second command uses the **Invoke-Command** cmdlet to run a **Start-Job** command in each of the **PSSessions** in the $s variable. The job runs a Get-EventLog command that gets the events in the System log. The command saves the results in the $j variable.Because the command used **Invoke-Command** to run the **Start-Job** command, the command actually started three independent jobs on each of the three computers. As a result, the command returned three job objects representing three jobs run locally on three different computers.
PS C:\> $j = invoke-command -session $s -scriptblock {start-job -scriptblock {get-eventlog -logname system}}

The third command displays the three job objects in $j.
PS C:\> $j

Id   Name     State      HasMoreData   Location   Command
--   ----     -----      -----------   --------   -------
1    Job1     Completed  True          Localhost  get-eventlog system
2    Job2     Completed  True          Localhost  get-eventlog system
3    Job3     Completed  True          Localhost  get-eventlog system


The fourth command uses Invoke-Command to run a **Receive-Job** command in each of the sessions in $s and save the results in the $Results variable.Because $j is a local variable, the script block uses the **Using** scope modifier to identify the $j variable. For more information about the **Using** scope modifier, see about_Remote_Variables (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=252653).
PS C:\> $results = Invoke-Command -Session $s -ScriptBlock {Receive-Job -Job $Using:j}
```

This example shows how to get the results of background jobs run on three remote computers.

## PARAMETERS

### -AutoRemoveJob
Indicates that this cmdlet deletes the job after it returns the job results.
If the job has more results, the job is still deleted, but **Receive-Job** displays a message.

This parameter works only on custom job types.
It is designed for instances of job types that save the job or the type outside of the session, such as instances of scheduled jobs.

This parameter cannot be used without the **Wait** parameter.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ComputerName
Specifies an array of names of computers.
This cmdlet gets the results of jobs that were run on the specified computers.
Enter the computer names.
Wildcard characters are supported.
The default is all jobs in the current session.

This parameter selects from among the job results that are stored on the local computer.
It does not get data from remote computers.
To get job results that are stored on remote computers, use the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a **Receive-Job** command remotely.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: ComputerName
Aliases: Cn

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
Indicates that this cmdlet continues waiting if jobs are in the Suspended or Disconnected state.
By default, the *Wait* parameter of **Receive-Job** returns, or terminates the wait, when jobs are in one of the following states:  Completed, Failed, Stopped, Suspended, or Disconnected.

The *Force* parameter is valid only when the *Wait* parameter is also used in the command.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Id
Specifies an array of IDs.
This cmdlet gets the results of jobs with the specified IDs.
The default is all jobs in the current session.

The ID is an integer that uniquely identifies the job in the current session.
It is easier to remember and type than the instance ID, but it is unique only in the current session.
You can type one or more IDs separated by commas.
To find the ID of a job, type `Get-Job` without parameters.

```yaml
Type: Int32[]
Parameter Sets: SessionIdParameterSet
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InstanceId
Specifies an array of instance IDs.
This cmdlet gets the results of jobs with the specified instance IDs.
The default is all jobs in the current session.

An instance ID is a GUID that uniquely identifies the job on the computer.
To find the instance ID of a job, use the Get-Job cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: Guid[]
Parameter Sets: InstanceIdParameterSet
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Job
Specifies the job for which results are being retrieved.
This parameter is required in a **Receive-Job** command.
Enter a variable that contains the job or a command that gets the job.
You can also pipe a job object to **Receive-Job**.

```yaml
Type: Job[]
Parameter Sets: Location, ComputerName, Session
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Keep
Indicates that this cmdlet saves the job results in the system, even after you have received them.
By default, the job results are deleted when they are retrieved.

To delete the results, use **Receive-Job** to receive them again without specifying *Keep* parameter, close the session, or use the **Remove-Job** cmdlet to delete the job from the session.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Location
Specifies an array of locations.
This cmdlet gets only the results of jobs in the specified locations.
The default is all jobs in the current session.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: Location
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
Specifies an array of friendly names.
This cmdlet gets the results of jobs that have the specified names.
Wildcard characters are supported.
The default is all jobs in the current session.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: NameParameterSet
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NoRecurse
Indicates that this cmdlet gets results only from the specified job.
By default, **Receive-Job** also gets the results of all child jobs of the specified job.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Session
Specifies an array of sessions.
This cmdlet gets the results of jobs that were run in the specified PowerShell session (**PSSession**).
Enter a variable that contains the **PSSession** or a command that gets the **PSSession**, such as a Get-PSSession command.
The default is all jobs in the current session.

```yaml
Type: PSSession[]
Parameter Sets: Session
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Wait
Indicates that this cmdlet suppresses the command prompt until all job results are received.
By default, **Receive-Job** immediately returns the available results.

By default, the *Wait* parameter waits until the job is in one of the following states: Completed, Failed, Stopped, Suspended, or Disconnected.
To direct the *Wait* parameter to continue waiting if the job state is Suspended or Disconnected, use the *Force* parameter together with the *Wait* parameter.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
