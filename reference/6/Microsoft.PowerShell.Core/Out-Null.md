# Out-Null

## SYNOPSIS
Hides the output instead of sending it down the pipeline or displaying it.

## SYNTAX

```
Out-Null [-InputObject <PSObject>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Out-Null** cmdlet sends its output to NULL, in effect, removing it from the pipeline and
preventing the output to be displayed at the screen.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Delete output
```
PS C:\> Get-ChildItem | Out-Null
```

This command gets items in the current location/directory, but its output is not passed through
the pipeline nor displayed at the command line.
This is useful for hiding output that you do not need.

## PARAMETERS

### -InputObject
Specifies the object to be sent to NULL (removed from pipeline).
Enter a variable that contains the objects, or type a command or expression that gets the objects.

```yaml
Type: PSObject
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### System.Management.Automation.PSObject
You can pipe any object to this cmdlet.
.

## OUTPUTS

### None
This cmdlet does not generate any output.

## NOTES
* The cmdlets that contain the **Out** verb (the **Out** cmdlets) do not have parameters for names or file paths. To send data to an **Out** cmdlet, use a pipeline operator (|) to send the output of a PowerShell command to the cmdlet. You can also store data in a variable and use the *InputObject* parameter to pass the data to the cmdlet. For more information, see the examples.
* **Out-Null** does not return any output objects. If you pipe the output of **Out-Null** to the Get-Member cmdlet, **Get-Member** reports that no objects have been specified.
