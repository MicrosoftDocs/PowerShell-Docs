## DESCRIPTION
The **Start-Job** cmdlet starts a PowerShell background job on the local computer.

A PowerShell background job runs a command without interacting with the current session.
When you start a background job, a job object returns immediately, even if the job takes an extended time to finish.
You can continue to work in the session without interruption while the job runs.

The job object contains useful information about the job, but it does not contain the job results.
When the job finishes, use the Receive-Job cmdlet to get the results of the job.
For more information about background jobs, see about_Jobs.

To run a background job on a remote computer, use the *AsJob* parameter that is available on many cmdlets, or use the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a **Start-Job** command on the remote computer.
For more information, see about_Remote_Jobs.

Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, **Start-Job** can start instances of custom job types, such as scheduled jobs.
For information about how to use **Start-Job** to start jobs with custom types, see the help topics for the job type feature.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Start a background job
```
PS C:\> Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-Process}
Id    Name  State    HasMoreData  Location   Command
---   ----  -----    -----------  --------   -------
1     Job1  Running  True         localhost  get-process
```

This command starts a background job that runs a Get-Process command.
The command returns a job object that has information about the job.
The command prompt returns immediately so that you can work in the session while the job runs in the background.

### Example 2: Start a job by using Invoke-Command
```
PS C:\> $jobWRM = Invoke-Command -ComputerName (Get-Content servers.txt) -ScriptBlock {Get-Service winrm} -JobName "WinRM" -ThrottleLimit 16 -AsJob
```

This command uses the **Invoke-Command** cmdlet and its *AsJob* parameter to start a background job that runs a command on many computers.
Because the command is running on a server that has significant network traffic, the command uses the *ThrottleLimit* parameter of **Invoke-Command** to limit the number of concurrent commands to 16.

The command uses the *ComputerName* parameter to specify the computers on which the job runs.
The value of the *ComputerName* parameter is a Get-Content command that gets the text in the Servers.txt file, a file of computer names in a domain.

The command uses the *ScriptBlock* parameter to specify the command and the *JobName* parameter to specify a friendly name for the job.

### Example 3: Get events from the System log on the local computer
```
PS C:\> $j = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-EventLog -Log system} -Credential domain01\user01
PS C:\> $j | Format-List -Property *

HasMoreData   : True
StatusMessage :
Location      : localhost
Command       : get-eventlog -log system
JobStateInfo  : Running

InstanceId    : 2d9d775f-63e0-4d48-b4bc-c05d0e177f34
Id            : 1
Name          : Job1
ChildJobs     : {Job2}
Output        : {}
Error         : {}
Progress      : {}
Verbose       : {}
Debug         : {}
Warning       : {}
StateChanged  :

PS C:\> $j.JobStateInfo.state
Completed
PS C:\> $results = Receive-Job -Job $j
PS C:\> $results

```

These commands manage a background job that gets all of the events from the System log in Event Viewer.
The job runs on the local computer.

The first command uses the **Start-Job** cmdlet to start the job.
It uses the *Credential* parameter to specify the user account of a user who has permission to run the job on the computer.
Then it stores the job object that **Start-Job** returns in the $j variable.

At this point, you can resume your other work while the job finishes.

The second command uses a pipeline operator (|) to pass the job object in $j to the Format-List cmdlet.
The **Format-List** command uses the *Property* parameter with a value of all (*) to display all of the properties of the job object in a list.

The third command displays the value of the **JobStateInfo** property.
This contains the status of the job.

The fourth command uses the **Receive-Job** cmdlet to get the results of the job.
It stores the results in the $results variable.

The final command displays the contents of the $results variable.

### Example 4: Run a script as a background job
```
PS C:\> Start-Job -FilePath "c:\scripts\sample.ps1"
```

This command runs the Sample.ps1 script as a background job.

### Example 5: Get a process by name by using a background job
```
PS C:\> Start-Job -Name "WinRm" -ScriptBlock {Get-Process winrm}
```

This command runs a background job that gets the **WinRM** process on the local computer.
The command uses the *ScriptBlock* parameter to specify the command that runs in the background job.
It uses the *Name* parameter to specify a friendly name for the new job.

### Example 6: Collect and save data by using a background job
```
PS C:\> Start-Job -Name GetMappingFiles -InitializationScript {Import-Module MapFunctions} -ScriptBlock {Get-Map -Name * | Set-Content D:\Maps.tif} -RunAs32
```

This command starts a job that collects lots of data, and then saves it in a .tif file.
The command uses the *InitializationScript* parameter to run a script block that imports a required module.
It also uses the *RunAs32* parameter to run the job in a 32-bit process even if the computer has a 64-bit operating system.

## PARAMETERS

### -ArgumentList
Specifies an array of arguments, or parameter values, for the script that is specified by the *FilePath* parameter.

Because all of the values that follow the *ArgumentList* parameter name are interpreted as being values of *ArgumentList*, specify this parameter as the last parameter in the command.

```yaml
Type: Object[]
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, LiteralFilePathComputerName, FilePathComputerName
Aliases: Args

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Authentication
Specifies the mechanism that is used to authenticate user credentials.
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- Default
- Basic
- Credssp
- Digest
- Kerberos
- Negotiate
- NegotiateWithImplicitCredential

The default value is Default.

CredSSP authentication is available only in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, and later versions of the Windows operating system.

For more information about the values of this parameter, see [AuthenticationMechanism Enumeration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.runspaces.authenticationmechanism) in the MSDN library.

Caution: Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) authentication, in which the user's credentials are passed to a remote computer to be authenticated, is designed for commands that require authentication on more than one resource, such as accessing a remote network share.
This mechanism increases the security risk of the remote operation.
If the remote computer is compromised, the credentials that are passed to it can be used to control the network session.

```yaml
Type: AuthenticationMechanism
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, LiteralFilePathComputerName, FilePathComputerName
Aliases:
Accepted values: Default, Basic, Negotiate, NegotiateWithImplicitCredential, Credssp, Digest, Kerberos

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential
Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
The default is the current user.

Type a user name, such as User01 or Domain01\User01, or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one from the Get-Credential cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, LiteralFilePathComputerName, FilePathComputerName
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DefinitionName
Specifies the definition name of the job that this cmdlet starts.
Use this parameter to start custom job types that have a definition name, such as scheduled jobs.

When you use **Start-Job** to start an instance of a scheduled job, the job starts immediately, regardless of job triggers or job options.
The resulting job instance is a scheduled job, but it is not saved to disk like triggered scheduled jobs.
Also, you cannot use the *ArgumentList* parameter of **Start-Job** to provide values for parameters of scripts that run in a scheduled job.
For more information, see about_Scheduled_Jobs.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: DefinitionName
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DefinitionPath
Specifies path of the definition for the job that this cmdlet starts.
Enter the definition path.
The concatenation of the values of the *DefinitionPath* and *DefinitionName* parameters is the fully qualified path of the job definition.
Use this parameter to start custom job types that have a definition path, such as scheduled jobs.

For scheduled jobs, the value of the *DefinitionPath* parameter is `$home\AppData\Local\Windows\PowerShell\ScheduledJob`.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: DefinitionName
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -FilePath
Specifies a local script that this cmdlet runs as a background job.
Enter the path and file name of the script or pipe a script path to **Start-Job**.
The script must be on the local computer or in a folder that the local computer can access.

When you use this parameter, PowerShell converts the contents of the specified script file to a script block and runs the script block as a background job.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: FilePathComputerName
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InitializationScript
Specifies commands that run before the job starts.
Enclose the commands in braces ( { } ) to create a script block.

Use this parameter to prepare the session in which the job runs.
For example, you can use it to add functions, snap-ins, and modules to the session.

```yaml
Type: ScriptBlock
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, LiteralFilePathComputerName, FilePathComputerName
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InputObject
Specifies input to the command.
Enter a variable that contains the objects, or type a command or expression that generates the objects.

In the value of the *ScriptBlock* parameter, use the $Input automatic variable to represent the input objects.

```yaml
Type: PSObject
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, LiteralFilePathComputerName, FilePathComputerName
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LiteralPath
Specifies a local script that this cmdlet runs as a background job.
Enter the path of a script on the local computer.

Unlike the *FilePath* parameter, this cmdlet uses the value of the *LiteralPath* parameter exactly as it is typed.
No characters are interpreted as wildcard characters.
If the path includes escape characters, enclose it in single quotation marks.
Single quotation marks tell PowerShell not to interpret any characters as escape sequences.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: LiteralFilePathComputerName
Aliases: PSPath

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
Specifies a friendly name for the new job.
You can use the name to identify the job to other job cmdlets, such as the Stop-Job cmdlet.

The default friendly name is Job#, where # is an ordinal number that is incremented for each job.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, LiteralFilePathComputerName, FilePathComputerName
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PSVersion
Specifies a version.
This cmdlet runs the job with the version of PowerShell.
The acceptable values for this parameter are: 2.0 and 3.0.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: Version
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, LiteralFilePathComputerName, FilePathComputerName
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RunAs32
Indicates that this cmdlet runs the job in a 32-bit process.
Use this parameter to force the job to run in a 32-bit process on a 64-bit operating system.

On 64-bit versions of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, when the **Start-Job** command includes the *RunAs32* parameter, you cannot use the *Credential* parameter to specify the credentials of another user.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, LiteralFilePathComputerName, FilePathComputerName
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ScriptBlock
Specifies the commands to run in the background job.
Enclose the commands in braces ( { } ) to create a script block.
This parameter is required.

```yaml
Type: ScriptBlock
Parameter Sets: ComputerName
Aliases: Command

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Type
Specifies the custom type for jobs that this cmdlet starts.
Enter a custom job type name, such as PSScheduledJob for scheduled jobs or PSWorkflowJob for workflows jobs.
This parameter is not valid for standard background jobs.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: DefinitionName
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### System.String
You can pipe an object that has the **Name** property to the *Name* parameter.
For example, you can pipe a **FileInfo** object from Get-ChildItem to **Start-Job**.

## OUTPUTS

### System.Management.Automation.PSRemotingJob
This cmdlet returns an object that represents the job that it started.

## NOTES
* To run in the background, **Start-Job** runs in its own session in the current session. When you use the **Invoke-Command** cmdlet to run a **Start-Job** command in a session on a remote computer, **Start-Job** runs in a session in the remote session.
