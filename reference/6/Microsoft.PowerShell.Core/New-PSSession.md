## DESCRIPTION
The **New-PSSession** cmdlet creates a Windows PowerShell session (**PSSession**) on a local or remote computer.
When you create a **PSSession**, Windows PowerShell establishes a persistent connection to the remote computer.

Use a **PSSession** to run multiple commands that share data, such as a function or the value of a variable.
To run commands in a **PSSession**, use the Invoke-Command cmdlet.
To use the **PSSession** to interact directly with a remote computer, use the Enter-PSSession cmdlet.
For more information, see about_PSSessions (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135181).

You can run commands on a remote computer without creating a **PSSession** by using the *ComputerName* parameters of **Enter-PSSession** or **Invoke-Command**.
When you use the *ComputerName* parameter, Windows PowerShell creates a temporary connection that is used for the command and is then closed.

Starting with PowerShell 6.0 you can use Secure Shell (SSH) to establish a connection to and create a session on a remote computer, if SSH is available on the local computer and the remote computer is configured with a PowerShell SSH endpoint. The benefit of an SSH based PowerShell remote session is that it can work across multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS). For SSH based sessions you use the **HostName** or **SSHConnection** parameter set to specify the remote computer and relevant connection information. For more information about how to set up PowerShell SSH remoting see (https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/master/demos/SSHRemoting).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Create a session on the local computer
```
PS C:\> $s = New-PSSession
```

This command creates a new **PSSession** on the local computer and saves the **PSSession** in the $s variable.

You can now use this **PSSession** to run commands on the local computer.

### Example 2: Create a session on a remote computer
```
PS C:\> $Server01 = New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01
```

This command creates a new **PSSession** on the Server01 computer and saves it in the $Server01 variable.

When creating multiple **PSSession** objects, assign them to variables with useful names.
This will help you manage the **PSSession** objects in subsequent commands.

### Example 3: Create sessions on multiple computers
```
PS C:\> $s1, $s2, $s3 = New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01,Server02,Server03
```

This command creates three **PSSession** objects, one on each of the computers specified by the *ComputerName* parameter.

The command uses the assignment operator (=) to assign the new **PSSession** objects to variables: $s1, $s2, $s3.
It assigns the Server01 **PSSession** to $s1, the Server02 **PSSession** to $s2, and the Server03 **PSSession** to $s3.

When you assign multiple objects to a series of variables, Windows PowerShell assigns each object to a variable in the series respectively.
If there are more objects than variables, all remaining objects are assigned to the last variable.
If there are more variables than objects, the remaining variables are empty (null).

### Example 4: Create a session with a specified port
```
PS C:\> New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01 -Port 8081 -UseSSL -ConfigurationName E12
```

This command creates a new **PSSession** on the Server01 computer that connects to server port 8081 and uses the SSL protocol.
The new **PSSession** uses an alternative session configuration called E12.

Before setting the port, you must configure the WinRM listener on the remote computer to listen on port 8081.
For more information, see the description of the *Port* parameter.

### Example 5: Create a session based on an existing session
```
PS C:\> New-PSSession -Session $s -Credential Domain01\User01
```

This command creates a **PSSession** with the same properties as an existing **PSSession**.
You can use this command format when the resources of an existing **PSSession** are exhausted and a new **PSSession** is needed to offload some of the demand.

The command uses the *Session* parameter of **New-PSSession** to specify the **PSSession** saved in the $s variable.
It uses the credentials of the Domain1\Admin01 user to complete the command.

### Example 6: Create a session with a global scope in a different domain
```
PS C:\> $global:s = New-PSSession -ComputerName Server1.Domain44.Corpnet.Fabrikam.com -Credential Domain01\Admin01
```

This example shows how to create a **PSSession** with a global scope on a computer in a different domain.

By default, **PSSession** objects created at the command line are created with local scope and **PSSession** objects created in a script have script scope.

To create a **PSSession** with global scope, create a new **PSSession** and then store the **PSSession** in a variable that is cast to a global scope.
In this case, the $s variable is cast to a global scope.

The command uses the *ComputerName* parameter to specify the remote computer.
Because the computer is in a different domain than the user account, the full name of the computer is specified together with the credentials of the user.

### Example 7: Create sessions for many computers
```
PS C:\> $rs = Get-Content C:\Test\Servers.txt | New-PSSession -ThrottleLimit 50
```

This command creates a **PSSession** on each of the 200 computers listed in the Servers.txt file and it stores the resulting **PSSession** in the $rs variable.
The **PSSession** objects have a throttle limit of 50.

You can use this command format when the names of computers are stored in a database, spreadsheet, text file, or other text-convertible format.

### Example 8: Create a session by using a URI
```
PS C:\> $s = New-PSSession -URI http://Server01:91/NewSession -Credential Domain01\User01
```

This command creates a **PSSession** on the Server01 computer and stores it in the $s variable.
It uses the *URI* parameter to specify the transport protocol, the remote computer, the port, and an alternate session configuration.
It also uses the *Credential* parameter to specify a user account that has permission to create a session on the remote computer.

### Example 9: Run a background job in a set of sessions
```
PS C:\> $s = New-PSSession -ComputerName (Get-Content Servers.txt) -Credential Domain01\Admin01 -ThrottleLimit 16
PS C:\> Invoke-Command -Session $s -ScriptBlock {Get-Process PowerShell} -AsJob
```

These commands create a set of **PSSession** objects and then run a background job in each of the **PSSession** objects.

The first command creates a new **PSSession** on each of the computers listed in the Servers.txt file.
It uses the **New-PSSession** cmdlet to create the **PSSession**.
The value of the *ComputerName* parameter is a command that uses the Get-Content cmdlet to get the list of computer names the Servers.txt file.

The command uses the *Credential* parameter to create the **PSSession** objects that have the permission of a domain administrator, and it uses the *ThrottleLimit* parameter to limit the command to 16 concurrent connections.
The command saves the **PSSession** objects in the $s variable.

The second command uses the *AsJob* parameter of the Invoke-Command cmdlet to start a background job that runs a `Get-Process PowerShell` command in each of the **PSSession** objects in $s.

For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see [about_Jobs](About/about_Jobs.md) and [about_Remote_Jobs](About/about_Remote_Jobs.md).

### Example 10: Create a session for a computer by using its URI
```
PS C:\> New-PSSession -ConnectionURI https://management.exchangelabs.com/Management
```

This command creates a **PSSession** objects that connects to a computer that is specified by a URI instead of a computer name.

### Example 11: Create a session option
```
PS C:\> $so = New-PSSessionOption -SkipCACheck
PS C:\> New-PSSession -ConnectionUri https://management.exchangelabs.com/Management -SessionOption $so -Credential Server01\Admin01
```

This example shows how to create a session option object and use the *SessionOption* parameter.

The first command uses the New-PSSessionOption cmdlet to create a session option.
It saves the resulting **SessionOption** object in the $so variable.

The second command uses the option in a new session.
The command uses the **New-PSSession** cmdlet to create a new session.
The value of the SessionOption parameter is the **SessionOption** object in the $so variable.

### Example 12: Create a session using SSH
```
PS C:\> New-PSSession -HostName LinuxServer01 -UserName UserA
```

This example shows how to create a new **PSSession** using Secure Shell (SSH). If SSH is configured on the remote computer to prompt for passwords then you will get a password prompt. Otherwise you will have to use SSH key based user authentication.

### Example 13: Create a session using SSH and specify the port and user authentication key
```
PS C:\> New-PSSession -HostName LinuxServer01 -UserName UserA -Port 22 -KeyFilePath c:\<path>\userAKey_rsa
```

This example shows how to create a **PSSession** using Secure Shell (SSH). It uses the *Port* parameter to specify the port to use and the *KeyFilePath* parameter to specify an RSA key used to identify and authenticate the user on the remote computer.

### Example 14: Create multiple sessions using SSH
```
PS C:\> $sshConnections = @{ HostName="WinServer1"; UserName="domain\userA"; KeyFilePath="c:\users\UserA\id_rsa" }, @{ HostName="LinuxServer5"; UserName="UserB"; KeyFilePath="c:\UserB\<path>\id_rsa }
PS C:\> New-PSSession -SSHConnection $sshConnections
```

This example shows how to create multiple sessions using Secure Shell (SSH) and the **SSHConnection** parameter set. The *SSHConnection* parameter takes an array of hash tables that contain connection information for each session. Note that this example requires that the target remote computers have SSH configured to support key based user authentication.

## PARAMETERS

### -AllowRedirection
Indicates that this cmdlet allows redirection of this connection to an alternate Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

When you use the *ConnectionURI* parameter, the remote destination can return an instruction to redirect to a different URI.
By default, Windows PowerShell does not redirect connections, but you can use this parameter to enable it to redirect the connection.

You can also limit the number of times the connection is redirected by changing the **MaximumConnectionRedirectionCount** session option value.
Use the *MaximumRedirection* parameter of the New-PSSessionOption cmdlet or set the **MaximumConnectionRedirectionCount** property of the **$PSSessionOption** preference variable.
The default value is 5.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: Uri
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ApplicationName
Specifies the application name segment of the connection URI.
Use this parameter to specify the application name when you are not using the *ConnectionURI* parameter in the command.

The default value is the value of the $PSSessionApplicationName preference variable on the local computer.
If this preference variable is not defined, the default value is WSMAN.
This value is appropriate for most uses.
For more information, see [about_Preference_Variables](About/about_Preference_Variables.md).

The WinRM service uses the application name to select a listener to service the connection request.
The value of this parameter should match the value of the **URLPrefix** property of a listener on the remote computer.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ComputerName
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Authentication
Specifies the mechanism that is used to authenticate the user's credentials.
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- Default
- Basic
- Credssp
- Digest
- Kerberos
- Negotiate
- NegotiateWithImplicitCredential

The default value is Default.

For more information about the values of this parameter, see [AuthenticationMechanism Enumeration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.runspaces.authenticationmechanism) in the MSDN library.

Caution: Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) authentication, in which the user credentials are passed to a remote computer to be authenticated, is designed for commands that require authentication on more than one resource, such as accessing a remote network share.
This mechanism increases the security risk of the remote operation.
If the remote computer is compromised, the credentials that are passed to it can be used to control the network session.

```yaml
Type: AuthenticationMechanism
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, Uri
Aliases:
Accepted values: Default, Basic, Negotiate, NegotiateWithImplicitCredential, Credssp, Digest, Kerberos

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CertificateThumbprint
Specifies the digital public key certificate (X509) of a user account that has permission to perform this action.
Enter the certificate thumbprint of the certificate.

Certificates are used in client certificate-based authentication.
They can be mapped only to local user accounts; they do not work with domain accounts.

To get a certificate, use the Get-Item or Get-ChildItem command in the Windows PowerShell Cert: drive.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, Uri
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ComputerName
Specifies an array of names of computers.
This cmdlet creates a persistent connection (**PSSession**) to the specified computer.
If you enter multiple computer names, **New-PSSession** creates multiple **PSSession** objects, one for each computer.
The default is the local computer.

Type the NetBIOS name, an IP address, or a fully qualified domain name of one or more remote computers.
To specify the local computer, type the computer name, localhost, or a dot (.).
When the computer is in a different domain than the user, the fully qualified domain name is required.
You can also pipe a computer name, in quotation marks, to **New-PSSession**.

To use an IP address in the value of the *ComputerName* parameter, the command must include the *Credential* parameter.
Also, the computer must be configured for HTTPS transport or the IP address of the remote computer must be included in the WinRM TrustedHosts list on the local computer.
For instructions for adding a computer name to the TrustedHosts list, see "How to Add a Computer to the Trusted Host List" in about_Remote_Troubleshooting (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135188).

To include the local computer in the value of the *ComputerName* parameter, start Windows PowerShell by using the Run as administrator option.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: ComputerName
Aliases: Cn

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ConfigurationName
Specifies the session configuration that is used for the new **PSSession**.

Enter a configuration name or the fully qualified resource URI for a session configuration.
If you specify only the configuration name, the following schema URI is prepended: http://schemas.microsoft.com/PowerShell.

The session configuration for a session is located on the remote computer.
If the specified session configuration does not exist on the remote computer, the command fails.

The default value is the value of the $PSSessionConfigurationName preference variable on the local computer.
If this preference variable is not set, the default is Microsoft.PowerShell.
For more information, see [about_Preference_Variables](About/about_Preference_Variables.md).

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, VMName, Uri, VMId, ContainerId
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ConnectionUri
Specifies a URI that defines the connection endpoint for the session.
The URI must be fully qualified.
The format of this string is as follows:

\<Transport\>://\<ComputerName\>:\<Port\>/\<ApplicationName\>

The default value is as follows:

`http://localhost:5985/WSMAN`

If you do not specify a *ConnectionURI*, you can use the *UseSSL*, *ComputerName*, *Port*, and *ApplicationName* parameters to specify the *ConnectionURI* values.

Valid values for the Transport segment of the URI are HTTP and HTTPS.
If you specify a connection URI with a Transport segment, but do not specify a port, the session is created with standards ports: 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.
To use the default ports for Windows PowerShell remoting, specify port 5985 for HTTP or 5986 for HTTPS.

If the destination computer redirects the connection to a different URI, Windows PowerShell prevents the redirection unless you use the *AllowRedirection* parameter in the command.

```yaml
Type: Uri[]
Parameter Sets: Uri
Aliases: URI, CU

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ContainerId
Specifies an array of IDs of containers.
This cmdlet starts an interactive session with each of the specified containers.
To see the containers that are available to you, use the **Get-Container** cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: ContainerId
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential
Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
The default is the current user.

Type a user name, such as User01, Domain01\User01, or User@Domain.com, or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one returned by the Get-Credential cmdlet.

When you type a user name, this cmdlet prompts you for a password.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, Uri
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: VMName, VMId
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -EnableNetworkAccess
Indicates that this cmdlet adds an interactive security token to loopback sessions.
The interactive token lets you run commands in the loopback session that get data from other computers.
For example, you can run a command in the session that copies XML files from a remote computer to the local computer.

A loopback session is a **PSSession** that originates and ends on the same computer.
To create a loopback session, omit the *ComputerName* parameter or set its value to dot (.), localhost, or the name of the local computer.

By default, this cmdlet creates loopback sessions by using a network token, which might not provide sufficient permission to authenticate to remote computers.

The *EnableNetworkAccess* parameter is effective only in loopback sessions.
If you use *EnableNetworkAccess* when you create a session on a remote computer, the command succeeds, but the parameter is ignored.

You can also enable remote access in a loopback session by using the CredSSP value of the *Authentication* parameter, which delegates the session credentials to other computers.

To protect the computer from malicious access, disconnected loopback sessions that have interactive tokens, which are those created by using the *EnableNetworkAccess* parameter, can be reconnected only from the computer on which the session was created.
Disconnected sessions that use CredSSP authentication can be reconnected from other computers.
For more information, see Disconnect-PSSession.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, Uri, Session
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -HostName
Specifies an array of computer names for a Secure Shell (SSH) based connection. This is similar to the ComputerName parameter except that the connection to the remote computer is made using SSH rather than Windows WinRM.

This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 6.0.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: SSHHost
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -KeyFilePath
Specifies a key file path used by Secure Shell (SSH) to authenticate a user on a remote computer.

SSH allows user authentication to be performed via private/public keys as an alternative to basic password authentication. If the remote computer is configured for key authentication then this parameter can be used to provide the key that identifies the user.

This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 6.0.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: SSHHost
Aliases: IdentityFilePath

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
Specifies a friendly name for the **PSSession**.

You can use the name to refer to the **PSSession** when you use other cmdlets, such as Get-PSSession and Enter-PSSession.
The name is not required to be unique to the computer or the current session.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Port
Specifies the network port on the remote computer that is used for this connection.

In PowerShell 6.0 this parameter was included in the **HostName** and **SSHConnection** parameter sets which support Secure Shell (SSH) connections.

**WinRM (ComputerName parameter set)**

To connect to a remote computer, the remote computer must be listening on the port that the connection uses.
The default ports are 5985, which is the WinRM port for HTTP, and 5986, which is the WinRM port for HTTPS.

Before using another port, you must configure the WinRM listener on the remote computer to listen at that port.
Use the following commands to configure the listener:

1.
`winrm delete winrm/config/listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTP`

2.
`winrm create winrm/config/listener?Address=*+Transport=HTTP @{Port="\<port-number\>"}`

Do not use the *Port* parameter unless you must.
The port setting in the command applies to all computers or sessions on which the command runs.
An alternate port setting might prevent the command from running on all computers.

**SSH (HostName and SSHConnection parameter sets)**
To connect to a remote computer, the remote computer must be configured with the SSH service (SSHD) and must be listening on the port that the connection uses. The default port for SSH is 22.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, SSHHost
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RunAsAdministrator
Indicates that the **PSSession** runs as administrator.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: ContainerId
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SSHConnection
This parameter takes an array of hashtables where each hashtable contains one or more connection parameters needed to establish a Secure Shell (SSH) connection (HostName, Port, UserName, KeyFilePath).

The hashtable connection parameters are the same as defined for the **HostName** parameter set.

The *SSHConnection* parameter is useful for creating multiple sessions where each session requires different connection information.

This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 6.0.

```yaml
Type: Hashtable[]
Parameter Sets: SSHHostHashParam
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SSHTransport
Indicates that the remote connection is established using Secure Shell (SSH).

By default PowerShell uses Windows WinRM to connect to a remote computer. This switch forces PowerShell to use the HostName parameter set for establishing an SSH based remote connection.

This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 6.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: SSHHost
Aliases:
Accepted values: true

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Session
Specifies an array of **PSSession** objects that this cmdlet uses as a model for the new **PSSession**.
This parameter creates new **PSSession** objects that have the same properties as the specified **PSSession** objects.

Enter a variable that contains the **PSSession** objects or a command that creates or gets the **PSSession** objects, such as a New-PSSession or Get-PSSession command.

The resulting **PSSession** objects have the same computer name, application name, connection URI, port, configuration name, throttle limit, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) value as the originals, but they have a different display name, ID, and instance ID (GUID).

```yaml
Type: PSSession[]
Parameter Sets: Session
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SessionOption
Specifies advanced options for the session.
Enter a **SessionOption** object, such as one that you create by using the New-PSSessionOption cmdlet, or a hash table in which the keys are session option names and the values are session option values.

The default values for the options are determined by the value of the $PSSessionOption preference variable, if it is set.
Otherwise, the default values are established by options set in the session configuration.

The session option values take precedence over default values for sessions set in the $PSSessionOption preference variable and in the session configuration.
However, they do not take precedence over maximum values, quotas or limits set in the session configuration.

For a description of the session options that includes the default values, see New-PSSessionOption.
For information about the $PSSessionOption preference variable, see [about_Preference_Variables](About/about_Preference_Variables.md).
For more information about session configurations, see about_Session_Configurations (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=145152).

```yaml
Type: PSSessionOption
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, Uri
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ThrottleLimit
Specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections that can be established to run this command.
If you omit this parameter or enter a value of 0 (zero), the default value, 32, is used.

The throttle limit applies only to the current command, not to the session or to the computer.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: ComputerName, VMName, Uri, VMId, Session, ContainerId
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UseSSL
Indicates that this cmdlet uses the SSL protocol to establish a connection to the remote computer.
By default, SSL is not used.

WS-Management encrypts all Windows PowerShell content transmitted over the network.
The *UseSSL* parameter offers an additional protection that sends the data across an HTTPS connection instead of an HTTP connection.

If you use this parameter, but SSL is not available on the port that is used for the command, the command fails.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: ComputerName
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UserName
Specifies the user name for the account used to create a session on the remote computer. User authentication method will depend on how Secure Shell (SSH) is configured on the remote computer.

If SSH is configured for basic password authentication then you will be prompted for the user password.

If SSH is configured for key based user authentication then a key file path can be provided via the KeyFilePath parameter and no password prompt will occur. Note that if the client user key file is located in an SSH known location then the KeyFilePath parameter is not needed for key based authentication, and user authentication will occur automatically based on the user name. See SSH documentation about key based user authentication for more information.

This is not a required parameter. If no UserName parameter is specified then the current log on user name is used for the connection.

This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 6.0.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: SSHHost
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -VMId
Specifies an array of ID of virtual machines.
This cmdlet starts an interactive session with each of the specified virtual machines.
To see the virtual machines that are available to you, use the following command:

`Get-VM | Select-Object -Property Name, ID`

```yaml
Type: Guid[]
Parameter Sets: VMId
Aliases: VMGuid

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -VMName
Specifies an array of names of virtual machines.
This cmdlet starts an interactive session with each of the specified virtual machines.
To see the virtual machines that are available to you, use the **Get-VM** cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: VMName
Aliases:

Required: True

## NOTES
* This cmdlet uses the Windows PowerShell remoting infrastructure. To use this cmdlet, the local computer and any remote computers must be configured for Windows PowerShell remoting. For more information, see [about_Remote_Requirements](About/about_Remote_Requirements.md).
* To create a **PSSession** on the local computer, start Windows PowerShell with the Run as administrator option.
* When you are finished with the **PSSession**, use the Remove-PSSession cmdlet to delete the **PSSession** and release its resources.
* The **HostName** and **SSHConnection** parameter sets were included starting with PowerShell 6.0. They were added to provide PowerShell remoting based on Secure Shell (SSH). Both SSH and PowerShell are supported on multiple platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and PowerShell remoting will work over these platforms where PowerShell and SSH are installed and configured. This is separate from the previous Windows only remoting that is based on WinRM and much of the WinRM specific features and limitations do not apply. For example WinRM based quotas, session options, custom endpoint configuration, and disconnect/reconnect features are currently not supported.
For more information about how to set up PowerShell SSH remoting see (https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/master/demos/SSHRemoting).
