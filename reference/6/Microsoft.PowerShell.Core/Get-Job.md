## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-Job** cmdlet gets objects that represent the background jobs that were started in the current session.
You can use **Get-Job** to get jobs that were started by using the Start-Job cmdlet, or by using the *AsJob* parameter of any cmdlet.

Without parameters, a **Get-Job** command gets all jobs in the current session.
You can use the parameters of **Get-Job** to get particular jobs.

The job object that **Get-Job** returns contains useful information about the job, but it does not contain the job results.
To get the results, use the Receive-Job cmdlet.

A PowerShell background job is a command that runs in the background without interacting with the current session.
Typically, you use a background job to run a complex command that takes a long time to finish.
For more information about background jobs in PowerShell, see about_Jobs.

Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, the **Get-Job** cmdlet also gets custom job types, such as workflow jobs and instances of scheduled jobs.
To find the job type of a job, use the **PSJobTypeName** property of the job.

To enable **Get-Job** to get a custom job type, import the module that supports the custom job type into the session before you run a **Get-Job** command, either by using the Import-Module cmdlet or by using or getting a cmdlet in the module.
For information about a particular custom job type, see the documentation of the custom job type feature.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get all background jobs started in the current session
```
PS C:\> Get-Job
```

This command gets all background jobs started in the current session.
It does not include jobs created in other sessions, even if the jobs run on the local computer.

### Example 2: Stop a job by using an instance ID
```
The first command uses the **Get-Job** cmdlet to get a job. It uses the *Name* parameter to identify the job. The command stores the job object that **Get-Job** returns in the $j variable. In this example, there is only one job with the specified name.
PS C:\> $j = Get-Job -Name Job1

The second command gets the **InstanceId** property of the object in the $j variable and stores it in the $ID variable.
PS C:\> $ID = $j.InstanceID

The third command displays the value of the $ID variable.
PS C:\> $ID

Guid
----
03c3232e-1d23-453b-a6f4-ed73c9e29d55

The fourth command uses Stop-Job cmdlet to stop the job. It uses the *InstanceId* parameter to identify the job and $ID variable to represent the instance ID of the job.
PS C:\> Stop-Job -InstanceId $ID
```

These commands show how to get the instance ID of a job and then use it to stop a job.
Unlike the name of a job, which is not unique, the instance ID is unique.

### Example 3: Get jobs that include a specific command
```
PS C:\> Get-Job -Command "*get-process*"
```

This command gets the jobs on the system that include a Get-Process command.
The command uses the *Command* parameter of **Get-Job** to limit the jobs retrieved.
The command uses wildcard characters (*) to get jobs that include a **Get-Process** command anywhere in the command string.

### Example 4: Get jobs that include a specific command by using the pipeline
```
PS C:\> "*get-process*" | Get-Job
```

Like the command in the previous example, this command gets the jobs on the system that include a **Get-Process** command.
The command uses a pipeline operator (|) to send a string, in quotation marks, to the **Get-Job** cmdlet.
It is the equivalent of the previous command.

### Example 5: Get jobs that have not been started
```
PS C:\> Get-Job -State NotStarted
```

This command gets only those jobs that have been created but have not yet been started.
This includes jobs that are scheduled to run in the future and those not yet scheduled.

### Example 6: Get jobs that have not been assigned a name
```
PS C:\> Get-Job -Name Job*
```

This command gets all jobs that have job names that begin with job.
Because job\<number\> is the default name for a job, this command gets all jobs that do not have an explicitly assigned name.

### Example 7: Use a job object to represent the job in a command
```
The first command uses the **Start-Job** cmdlet to start a background job that runs a **Get-Process** command on the local computer. The command uses the *Name* parameter of **Start-Job** to assign a friendly name to the job.
PS C:\> Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-Process} -Name MyJob

The second command uses Get-Job to get the job. It uses the *Name* parameter of **Get-Job** to identify the job. The command saves the resulting job object in the $j variable.
PS C:\> $j = Get-Job -Name MyJob

The third command displays the value of the job object in the $j variable. The value of the **State** property shows that the job is completed. The value of the **HasMoreData** property shows that there are results available from the job that have not yet been retrieved.
PS C:\> $j
Id     Name            PSJobTypeName   State         HasMoreData     Location             Command
--     ----            -------------   -----         -----------     --------             -------
6      MyJob           BackgroundJob   Completed     True            localhost            Get-Process

The fourth command uses the **Receive-Job** cmdlet to get the results of the job. It uses the job object in the $j variable to represent the job. You can also use a pipeline operator to send a job object to **Receive-Job**.
PS C:\> Receive-Job -Job $j
Handles  NPM(K)    PM(K)      WS(K) VM(M)   CPU(s)     Id ProcessName
-------  ------    -----      ----- -----   ------     -- -----------
    124       4    13572      12080    59            1140 audiodg
    783      16    11428      13636   100             548 CcmExec
     96       4     4252       3764    59            3856 ccmsetup
...
```

This example shows how to use **Get-Job** to get a job object, and then it shows how to use the job object to represent the job in a command.

### Example 8: Get all jobs including jobs started by a different method
```
The first command uses the **Start-Job** cmdlet to start a job on the local computer.
PS C:\> Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-EventLog System}

The second command uses the *AsJob* parameter of the **Invoke-Command** cmdlet to start a job on the S1 computer. Even though the commands in the job run on the remote computer, the job object is created on the local computer, so you use local commands to manage the job.
PS C:\> Invoke-Command -ComputerName S1 -ScriptBlock {Get-EventLog System} -AsJob

The third command uses the **Invoke-Command** cmdlet to run a **Start-Job** command on the S2 computer. By using this method, the job object is created on the remote computer, so you use remote commands to manage the job.
PS C:\> Invoke-Command -ComputerName S2 -ScriptBlock {Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-EventLog System}}

The fourth command uses **Get-Job** to get the jobs stored on the local computer. The **PSJobTypeName** property of jobs, introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0, shows that the local job started by using the **Start-Job** cmdlet is a background job and the job started in a remote session by using the **Invoke-Command** cmdlet is a remote job.
PS C:\> Get-Job
Id     Name       PSJobTypeName   State         HasMoreData     Location        Command
--     ----       -------------   -----         -----------     --------        -------
1      Job1       BackgroundJob   Running       True            localhost       Get-EventLog System
2      Job2       RemoteJob       Running       True            S1              Get-EventLog System

The fifth command uses **Invoke-Command** to run a **Get-Job** command on the S2 computer.The sample output shows the results of the Get-Job command. On the S2 computer, the job appears to be a local job. The computer name is localhost and the job type is a background job.For more information about how to run background jobs on remote computers, see about_Remote_Jobs.
PS C:\> Invoke-Command -ComputerName S2 -ScriptBlock {Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-EventLog System}}
Id    Name     PSJobTypeName  State      HasMoreData   Location   Command
--    ----     -------------  -----      -----------   -------    -------
4     Job4     BackgroundJob  Running    True          localhost  Get-Eventlog System
```

This example demonstrates that the **Get-Job** cmdlet can get all of the jobs that were started in the current session, even if they were started by using different methods.

### Example 9: Investigate a failed job
```
The first command uses the **Start-Job** cmdlet to start a job on the local computer. The job object that **Start-Job** returns shows that the job failed. The value of the **State** property is Failed.
PS C:\> Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-Process}
Id     Name       PSJobTypeName   State       HasMoreData     Location             Command
--     ----       -------------   -----       -----------     --------             -------
1      Job1       BackgroundJob   Failed      False           localhost            Get-Process

The second command uses the **Get-Job** cmdlet to get the job. The command uses the dot method to get the value of the **JobStateInfo** property of the object. It uses a pipeline operator to send the object in the **JobStateInfo** property to the Format-List cmdlet, which formats all of the properties of the object (*) in a list.The result of the **Format-List** command shows that the value of the **Reason** property of the job is blank.
PS C:\> (Get-Job).JobStateInfo | Format-List -Property *
State  : Failed
Reason :

The third command investigates more. It uses a **Get-Job** command to get the job and then uses a pipeline operator to send the whole job object to the **Format-List** cmdlet, which displays all of the properties of the job in a list.The display of all properties in the job object shows that the job contains a child job named Job2.
PS C:\> Get-Job | Format-List -Property *
HasMoreData   : False
StatusMessage :
Location      : localhost
Command       : get-process
JobStateInfo  : Failed
Finished      : System.Threading.ManualReset
EventInstanceId    : fb792295-1318-4f5d-8ac8-8a89c5261507
Id            : 1
Name          : Job1
ChildJobs     : {Job2}
Output        : {}
Error         : {}
Progress      : {}
Verbose       : {}
Debug         : {}
Warning       : {}
StateChanged  :

The fourth command uses **Get-Job** to get the job object that represents the Job2 child job. This is the job in which the command actually ran. It uses the dot method to get the **Reason** property of the **JobStateInfo** property.The result shows that the job failed because of an Access Denied error. In this case, the user forgot to use the Run as administrator option when starting PowerShell.Because background jobs use the remoting features of PowerShell, the computer must be configured for remoting to run a job, even when the job runs on the local computer.For information about requirements for remoting in PowerShell, see about_Remote_Requirements. For troubleshooting tips, see about_Remote_Troubleshooting.
PS C:\> (Get-Job -Name job2).JobStateInfo.Reason
Connecting to remote server using WSManCreateShellEx api failed. The async callback gave the following error message: Access is denied.
```

This command shows how to use the job object that **Get-Job** returns to investigate why a job failed.
It also shows how to get the child jobs of each job.

### Example 10: Get filtered results
```
The first command uses the **Workflow** keyword to create the WFProcess workflow.
PS C:\> Workflow WFProcess {Get-Process}

The second command uses the *AsJob* parameter of the WFProcess workflow to run the workflow as a background job. It uses the *JobName* parameter of the workflow to specify a name for the job, and the *PSPrivateMetadata* parameter of the workflow to specify a custom ID.
PS C:\> WFProcess -AsJob -JobName WFProcessJob -PSPrivateMetadata @{MyCustomId = 92107}

The third command uses the *Filter* parameter of **Get-Job** to get the job by custom ID that was specified in the *PSPrivateMetadata* parameter.
PS C:\> Get-Job -Filter @{MyCustomId = 92107}
Id     Name            State         HasMoreData     Location             Command
--     ----            -----         -----------     --------             -------
1      WFProcessJob    Completed     True            localhost            WFProcess
```

This example shows how to use the *Filter* parameter to get a workflow job.
The *Filter* parameter, introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0 is valid only on custom job types, such as workflow jobs and scheduled jobs.

### Example 11: Get information about child jobs
```
The first command gets the jobs in the current session. The output includes a background job, a remote job and several instances of a scheduled job. The remote job, Job4, appears to have failed.
PS C:\> Get-Job
Id     Name            PSJobTypeName   State         HasMoreData     Location             Command
--     ----            -------------   -----         -----------     --------             -------
2      Job2            BackgroundJob   Completed     True            localhost            .\Get-Archive.ps1
4      Job4            RemoteJob       Failed        True            Server01, Server02   .\Get-Archive.ps1
7      UpdateHelpJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     True            localhost            Update-Help
8      UpdateHelpJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     True            localhost            Update-Help
9      UpdateHelpJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     True            localhost            Update-Help
10     UpdateHelpJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     True            localhost            Update-Help

The second command uses the *IncludeChildJob* parameter of **Get-Job**. The output adds the child jobs of all jobs that have child jobs.In this case, the revised output shows that only the Job5 child job of Job4 failed.
PS C:\> Get-Job -IncludeChildJob
Id     Name            PSJobTypeName   State         HasMoreData     Location             Command
--     ----            -------------   -----         -----------     --------             -------
2      Job2            BackgroundJob   Completed     True            localhost           .\Get-Archive.ps1
3      Job3                            Completed     True            localhost           .\Get-Archive.ps1
4      Job4            RemoteJob       Failed        True            Server01, Server02  .\Get-Archive.ps1
5      Job5                            Failed        False           Server01            .\Get-Archive.ps1
6      Job6                            Completed     True            Server02            .\Get-Archive.ps1
7      UpdateHelpJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     True            localhost            Update-Help
8      UpdateHelpJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     True            localhost            Update-Help
9      UpdateHelpJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     True            localhost            Update-Help
10     UpdateHelpJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     True            localhost            Update-Help

The third command uses the *ChildJobState* parameter with a value of Failed.The output includes all parent jobs and only the child jobs that failed.
PS C:\> Get-Job -Name Job4 -ChildJobState Failed
Id     Name            PSJobTypeName   State         HasMoreData     Location             Command
--     ----            -------------   -----         -----------     --------             -------
2      Job2            BackgroundJob   Completed     True            localhost           .\Get-Archive.ps1
4      Job4            RemoteJob       Failed        True            Server01, Server02  .\Get-Archive.ps1
5      Job5                            Failed        False           Server01            .\Get-Archive.ps1
7      UpdateHelpJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     True            localhost            Update-Help
8      UpdateHelpJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     True            localhost            Update-Help
9      UpdateHelpJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     True            localhost            Update-Help
10     UpdateHelpJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     True            localhost            Update-Help

The fifth command uses the **JobStateInfo** property of jobs and its **Reason** property to discover why Job5 failed.
PS C:\> (Get-Job -Name Job5).JobStateInfo.Reason
Connecting to remote server Server01 failed with the following error message:
Access is denied.
For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.
```

This example shows the effect of using the *IncludeChildJob* and *ChildJobState* parameters of the **Get-Job** cmdlet.

## PARAMETERS

### -After
Gets completed jobs that ended after the specified date and time.
Enter a **DateTime** object, such as one returned by the Get-Date cmdlet or a string that can be converted to a **DateTime** object, such as `Dec 1, 2012 2:00 AM` or `11/06`.

This parameter works only on custom job types, such as workflow jobs and scheduled jobs, that have an **EndTime** property.
It does not work on standard background jobs, such as those created by using the **Start-Job** cmdlet.
For information about support for this parameter, see the help topic for the job type.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: DateTime
Parameter Sets: SessionIdParameterSet, InstanceIdParameterSet, NameParameterSet, StateParameterSet, CommandParameterSet
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Before
Gets completed jobs that ended before the specified date and time.
Enter a **DateTime** object.

This parameter works only on custom job types, such as workflow jobs and scheduled jobs, that have an **EndTime** property.
It does not work on standard background jobs, such as those created by using the **Start-Job** cmdlet.
For information about support for this parameter, see the help topic for the job type.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: DateTime
Parameter Sets: SessionIdParameterSet, InstanceIdParameterSet, NameParameterSet, StateParameterSet, CommandParameterSet
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ChildJobState
Gets only the child jobs that have the specified state.
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- NotStarted
-  Running
-  Completed
- Failed
- Stopped
- Blocked
- Suspended
- Disconnected
- Suspending
- Stopping

By default, **Get-Job** does not get child jobs.
By using the *IncludeChildJob* parameter, **Get-Job** gets all child jobs.
If you use the *ChildJobState* parameter, the *IncludeChildJob* parameter has no effect.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: JobState
Parameter Sets: SessionIdParameterSet, InstanceIdParameterSet, NameParameterSet, StateParameterSet, CommandParameterSet
Aliases:
Accepted values: NotStarted, Running, Completed, Failed, Stopped, Blocked, Suspended, Disconnected, Suspending, Stopping, AtBreakpoint

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Command
Specifies an array of commands as strings.
This cmdlet gets the jobs that include the specified commands.
The default is all jobs.
You can use wildcard characters to specify a command pattern.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: CommandParameterSet
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Filter
Specifies a hash table of conditions.
This cmdlet gets jobs that satisfy all of the conditions.
Enter a hash table where the keys are job properties and the values are job property values.

This parameter works only on custom job types, such as workflow jobs and scheduled jobs.
It does not work on standard background jobs, such as those created by using the **Start-Job** cmdlet.
For information about support for this parameter, see the help topic for the job type.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: Hashtable
Parameter Sets: FilterParameterSet
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -HasMoreData
Indicates whether this cmdlet gets only jobs that have the specified **HasMoreData** property value.
The **HasMoreData** property indicates whether all job results have been received in the current session.
To get jobs that have more results, specify a value of $True.
To get jobs that do not have more results, specify a value of $False.

To get the results of a job, use the Receive-Job cmdlet.

When you use the **Receive-Job** cmdlet, it deletes from its in-memory, session-specific storage the results that it returned.
When it has returned all results of the job in the current session, it sets the value of the **HasMoreData** property of the job to $False) to indicate that it has no more results for the job in the current session.
Use the *Keep* parameter of **Receive-Job** to prevent **Receive-Job** from deleting results and changing the value of the **HasMoreData** property.
For more information, type `Get-Help Receive-Job`.

The **HasMoreData** property is specific to the current session.
If results for a custom job type are saved outside of the session, such as the scheduled job type, which saves job results on disk, you can use the **Receive-Job** cmdlet in a different session to get the job results again, even if the value of **HasMoreData** is $False.
For more information, see the help topics for the custom job type.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: Boolean
Parameter Sets: SessionIdParameterSet, InstanceIdParameterSet, NameParameterSet, StateParameterSet, CommandParameterSet
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Id
Specifies an array of IDs of jobs that this cmdlet gets.

The ID is an integer that uniquely identifies the job in the current session.
It is easier to remember and to type than the instance ID, but it is unique only in the current session.
You can type one or more IDs separated by commas.
To find the ID of a job, type `Get-Job` without parameters.

```yaml
Type: Int32[]
Parameter Sets: SessionIdParameterSet
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IncludeChildJob
Indicates that this cmdlet returns child jobs, in addition to parent jobs.

This parameter is especially useful for investigating workflow jobs, for which **Get-Job** returns a container parent job, and job failures, because the reason for the failure is saved in a property of the child job.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: SessionIdParameterSet, InstanceIdParameterSet, NameParameterSet, StateParameterSet, CommandParameterSet
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InstanceId
Specifies an array of instance IDs of jobs that this cmdlet gets.
The default is all jobs.

An instance ID is a GUID that uniquely identifies the job on the computer.
To find the instance ID of a job, use **Get-Job**.

```yaml
Type: Guid[]
Parameter Sets: InstanceIdParameterSet
Aliases:

Required: True
