## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-WinEvent** cmdlet gets events from event logs, including classic logs, such as the System and Application logs, and the event logs that are generated by the Windows Event Log technology introduced in Windows Vista.
It also gets events in log files generated by Event Tracing for Windows (ETW).

Without parameters, a **Get-WinEvent** command gets all the events from all the event logs on the computer.
To interrupt the command, press CTRL + C.

**Get-WinEvent** also lists event logs and event log providers.
You can get events from selected logs or from logs generated by selected event providers.
And, you can combine events from multiple sources in a single command.
This cmdlet allows you to filter events by using XPath queries, structured XML queries, and simplified hash-table queries.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get all the logs from a local computer
```
PS C:\> Get-WinEvent -ListLog  *
```

This command gets all the logs on the local computer.

Logs are listed in the order that **Get-WinEvent** gets them.
Classic logs are usually retrieved first, followed by the new Windows Eventing logs.

Because there are typically more than a hundred event logs, this parameter requires a log name or name pattern.
To get all the logs, use *.

### Example 2: Get the classic Setup log from a local computer
```
PS C:\> Get-WinEvent -ListLog Setup | Format-List -Property *

FileSize                       : 69632
IsLogFull                      : False
LastAccessTime                 : 2/14/2008 12:55:12 AM
LastWriteTime                  : 7/9/2008 3:12:05 AM
OldestRecordNumber             : 1
RecordCount                    : 3
LogName                        : Setup
LogType                        : Operational
LogIsolation                   : Application
IsEnabled                      : True
IsClassicLog                   : False
SecurityDescriptor             : O:BAG:SYD:(A;;0xf0007;;;SY)(A;
(A;;0x1;;;S-1-5-32-573)
LogFilePath                    : %SystemRoot%\System32\Winevt\L
MaximumSizeInBytes             : 1052672
LogMode                        : Circular
OwningProviderName             : Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog
ProviderNames                  : {Microsoft-Windows-WUSA, Micro
ProviderLevel                  :
ProviderKeywords               :
ProviderBufferSize             : 64
ProviderMinimumNumberOfBuffers : 0
ProviderMaximumNumberOfBuffers : 64
ProviderLatency                : 1000
ProviderControlGuid            :
```

This command gets an object that represents the classic Setup log on the local computer.
The object includes useful information about the log, including its size, event log provider, file path, and whether it is enabled.

### Example 3: Get event logs from a server
```
PS C:\> Get-WinEvent -ListLog * -ComputerName Server01 |Where-Object {$_.RecordCount}
```

This command gets only event logs on the Server01 computer that contain events.
Many logs might be empty.

The command uses the **RecordCount** property of the **EventLogConfiguration** object that **Get-WinEvent** returns when you use the *ListLog* parameter.

### Example 4: Get event logs from multiple servers
```
PS C:\> $S = "Server01", "Server02", "Server03"
PS C:\> ForEach ($Server in $S) {$Server; Get-WinEvent -ListLog "Windows PowerShell" -Computername $Server}
```

This example gets objects that represent the Windows PowerShell event logs on the Server01, Server02, and Server03 computers.
This command uses the **ForEach** keyword because the *ComputerName* parameter takes only one value.

The first command saves the names of the computers in the $S variable.

The second command uses a **ForEach** statement.
For each of the computers in the $S variable, it performs the command in the script block (within the braces).
First, the command prints the name of the computer.
Then, it runs a **Get-WinEvent** command to get an object that represents the Windows PowerShell log.

### Example 5: Get event log providers and logs from a local computer
```
PS C:\> Get-WinEvent -ListProvider *
```

This command gets the event log providers on the local computer and the logs to which they write, if any.

### Example 6: Get all event log providers that write to a specific log
```
PS C:\> (Get-WinEvent -ListLog Application).ProviderNames
```

This command gets all of the providers that write to the Application log on the local computer.

### Example 7: Get event log providers that have a specific string in the name
```
PS C:\> Get-WinEvent -ListProvider *Policy*
```

This command gets the event log providers whose names include the word Policy.

### Example 8: Get event IDs that the event provider generates
```
PS C:\> (Get-WinEvent -ListProvider Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy).Events | Format-Table ID, Description -AutoSize
```

This command lists the event IDs that the Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy event provider generates along with the event description.

It uses the **Events** property of the object that **Get-WinEvent** returns when you use the *ListProvider* parameter, and it uses the **ID** and **Description** properties of the object in the **Events** property.

### Example 9: Get properties of event objects
```
The first command uses the **Get-WinEvent** cmdlet to get all of the events in the Windows PowerShell event log. Then, it saves them in the $Events variable. The log name is enclosed in quotation marks because it contains a space.
PS C:\> $Events = Get-WinEvent -LogName "Windows PowerShell"

The second command uses the **Count** property of object collections to find the number of entries in the event log.
PS C:\> $Events.Count
195

The third command displays the incidence of each event in the log, with the most frequent events first. In this example, event ID 600 is the most frequent event.
PS C:\> $Events | Group-Object -Property Id -NoElement | Sort-Object -Property Count -Descending

Count Name
----- ----
147 600
22 400
21 601
3 403
2 103

The fourth command groups the items by the value of their **LevelDisplayName** property to show how many Error, Warning, and Information events are in the log.
PS C:\> $Events | Group-Object -Property LevelDisplayName -NoElement

Count Name
----- ----
2 Warning
193 Information
```

This example shows how to use the properties of the event objects that **Get-WinEvent** returns to learn about the events in an event log.

### Example 10: Get error events that have a specified string in their name
```
PS C:\> Get-WinEvent -LogName *disk*, Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-WHEA
```

This command gets the error events whose names include disk from all of the event logs on the computer and from the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-WHEA event log.

### Example 11: Get events from a copy of the wps_2 event log file
```
PS C:\> Get-WinEvent -Path 'c:\ps-test\Windows PowerShell.evtx'
```

This command gets events from a copy of the Windows PowerShell event log file in a test directory.
The path is enclosed in quotation marks because the log name includes a space.

### Example 12: Get the first 100 events from an ETW event trace log
```
The first command gets the 100 oldest events in the log. It uses the **Get-WinEvent** cmdlet to get events from the Tracelog.etl file. It uses the *MaxEvents* parameter to limit the retrieval to 100 events. Because the events are listed in the order in which they are written to the log (oldest first), the *Oldest* parameter is required.
PS C:\> Get-WinEvent -Path 'C:\Tracing\TraceLog.etl' -MaxEvents 100 -Oldest

The second command gets the 100 newest events in the log. It uses the **Get-WinEvent** cmdlet to get all the events from the Tracing.etl file. It pipes the events to the Sort-Object cmdlet, which sorts them in descending order by the value of the **TimeCreated** property. Then, it pipes the sorted events to the Select-Object cmdlet to select the newest 100 events.
PS C:\> Get-WinEvent -Path 'C:\Tracing\TraceLog.etl' -Oldest | Sort-Object -Property TimeCreated -Descending | Select-Object -First 100
```

These commands get the first 100 events from an Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) event trace log file.

### Example 13: Get events from an event trace log
```
PS C:\> Get-WinEvent -Path "C:\Tracing\TraceLog.etl", "c:\Logs\Windows PowerShell.evtx" -Oldest | Where-Object {$_.ID -eq "103"}
```

This example shows how to get the events from an event trace log file (.etl) and from a copy of the Windows PowerShell log file (.evtx) that was saved to a test directory.

You can combine multiple file types in a single command.
Because the files contain the same type of .NET Framework object (an EventLogRecord object), you can use the same properties to filter them.

The command requires the **Oldest** parameter because it is reading from an .etl file, but the **Oldest** parameter applies to both of the files.

### Example 14: Filter event log results
```
PS C:\> # Use the Where-Object cmdlet

PS C:\> $Yesterday = (Get-Date) - (New-TimeSpan -Day 1)
PS C:\> Get-WinEvent -LogName "Windows PowerShell" | Where-Object {$_.TimeCreated -ge $Yesterday}

# Uses FilterHashTable

PS C:\> $Yesterday = (Get-Date) - (New-TimeSpan -Day 1)
PS C:\> Get-WinEvent -FilterHashTable @{LogName='Windows PowerShell'; Level=3; StartTime=$Yesterday}

# Use FilterXML

PS C:\> Get-WinEvent -FilterXML "<QueryList><Query><Select Path='Windows PowerShell'>*[System[Level=3 and TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime)&lt;= 86400000]]]</Select></Query></QueryList>"

# Use FilterXPath

PS C:\> Get-WinEvent -LogName "Windows Powershell" -FilterXPath "*[System[Level=3 and TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) &lt;= 86400000]]]"
```

This example shows different filtering methods for selecting events from an event log.
All of these commands get events that occurred in the last 24 hours from the Windows PowerShell event log.

The filter methods are more efficient than using the Where-Object cmdlet because the filters are applied while the objects are being retrieved, rather than retrieving all the objects and then filtering them.

Because dates are difficult to formulate in the XML and XPath formats, to create the XML content for the date, the Filter Current Log feature of Event Viewer is used.
For more information about this feature, see Event Viewer Help.

### Example 15: Use a filter hash table to get events from the performance log
```
PS C:\> $Date = (Get-Date).AddDays(-2)
PS C:\> $Events = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashTable @{ LogName = "Microsoft-Windows-Diagnostics-Performance/Operational"; StartTime = $Date; ID = 100 }
```

This example uses a filter hash table to get events from the performance log.

The first command uses the Get-Date cmdlet and the **AddDays** method to get a date that is two days before the current date.
It saves the date in the $date variable.

The second command uses the **Get-WinEvent** cmdlet with the **FilterHashTable** parameter.
The keys in the hash table define a filter that selects events from the performance log that occurred within the last two days and that have event ID 100.

The **LogName** key specifies the event log, the **StartTime** key specifies the date, and the ID key specifies the event ID.

### Example 16: Use a filter hash table to get IE application errors
```
PS C:\> $StartTime = (Get-Date).AddDays(-7)
PS C:\> $IE_Error = Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{Logname="Application"; ProviderName="Application Error"; Data="iexplore.exe"; StartTime=$StartTime}
```

This example uses a filter hash table to find Internet Explorer application errors that occurred within the last week.

The first command gets the date that is seven days before the current date and stores it in the $StartTime variable.

The second command uses the **Get-WinEvent** cmdlet with the **FilterHashTable** parameter.
The keys in the hash table define a filter that selects events from the Application log that were written by the Application Error provider and include the phrase "iexplore.exe".

The **LogName** key specifies the event log.
The **ProviderName** key specifies the event provider, the **StartTime** key specifies the starting date of the events, and the **Data** key specifies the text in the event message.

## PARAMETERS

### -ComputerName
Specifies the name of the computer that this cmdlet gets events from the event logs.
Type the NetBIOS name, an Internet Protocol (IP) address, or the fully qualified domain name of the computer.
The default value is the local computer.

This parameter accepts only one computer name at a time.
For more information about this parameter, see the examples.

To get events and event logs from remote computers, the firewall port for the event log service must be configured to allow remote access.

This cmdlet does not rely on PowerShell remoting.
You can use the *ComputerName* parameter even if your computer is not configured to run remote commands.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: GetLogSet, ListLogSet, ListProviderSet, GetProviderSet, HashQuerySet, XmlQuerySet
Aliases: Cn

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Local computer
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential
Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
The default value is the current user.

Type a user name, such as User01 or Domain01\User01.
Or, enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one generated by the Get-Credential cmdlet.
If you type a user name, you are prompted for a password.
If you type only the parameter name, you are prompted for both a user name and a password.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Current user
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -FilterHashtable
Specifies a query in hash table format to select events from one or more event logs.
The query contains a hash table with one or more key-value pairs.

Hash table queries have the following rules:

- Keys and values are case-insensitive.
- Wildcard characters are valid only in the values associated with the LogName and ProviderName keys.
- Each key can be listed only once in each hash-table.
- The Path value takes paths to .etl, .evt, and .evtx log files.
- The LogName, Path, and ProviderName keys can be used in the same query.
- The UserID key can take a valid security identifier (SID) or a domain account name that can be used to construct a valid System.Security.Principal.NTAccount object.
- The Data value takes event data in an unnamed field. This is for events in classic event logs.
- The * key represents a named event data field.

When Get-WinEvent cannot interpret a key-value pair, it interprets the key as a case-sensitive name for the event data in the event.

The valid key-value pairs are as follows:

- LogName=\<String\[\]\>
- ProviderName=\<String\[\]\>
- Path=\<String\[\]\>
- Keywords=\<Long\[\]\>
- ID=\<Int32\[\]\>
- Level=\<Int32\[\]\>
- StartTime=\<DateTime\>
- EndTime=\<DataTime\>
- UserID=\<SID\>
- Data=\<String\[\]\>
- *=\<String\[\]\>

```yaml
Type: Hashtable[]
Parameter Sets: HashQuerySet
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -FilterXml
Specifies a structured XML query that this cmdlet selects events from one or more event logs.

To generate a valid XML query, use the **Create Custom View** and **Filter Current Log** features in Event Viewer.
Use the items in the dialog box to create a query, and then click the XML tab to view the query in XML format.
You can copy the XML from the XML tab into the value of the *FilterXml* parameter.
For more information about the Event Viewer features, see Event Viewer Help.

Typically, you use an XML query to create a complex query that contains several XPath statements.
The XML format also allows you to use a "Suppress" XML element that excludes events from the query.
For more information about the XML schema for event log queries, see [Query Schema](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa385760) and the XML Event Queries section of the [Event Selection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa385231) in the MSDN library.
