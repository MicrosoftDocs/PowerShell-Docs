## DESCRIPTION

The `Get-Service` cmdlet gets objects that represent the services on a computer, including running
and stopped services. By default, when `Get-Service` is run without parameters, all the local
computer's services are returned.

You can direct this cmdlet to get only particular services by specifying the service name or the
display name of the services, or you can pipe service objects to this cmdlet.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get all services on the computer

This example gets all of the services on the computer. It behaves as though you typed
`Get-Service *`. The default display shows the status, service name, and display name of each
service.

```powershell
Get-Service
```

### Example 2: Get services that begin with a search string

This example retrieves services with service names that begin with WMI (Windows Management
Instrumentation).

```powershell
Get-Service "wmi*"
```

### Example 3: Display services that include a search string

This example displays services with a display name that includes the word network. Searching the
display name finds network-related services even when the service name doesn't include Net, such as
xmlprov, the Network Provisioning Service.

```powershell
Get-Service -Displayname "*network*"
```

### Example 4: Get services that begin with a search string and an exclusion

This example only gets the services with service names that begin with **win**, except for the WinRM
service.

```powershell
Get-Service -Name "win*" -Exclude "WinRM"
```

### Example 5: Display services that are currently active

This example displays only the services with a status of Running.

```powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Running"}
```

`Get-Service` gets all the services on the computer and sends the objects down the pipeline. The
`Where-Object` cmdlet, selects only the services with a **Status** property that equals Running.

Status is only one property of service objects. To see all of the properties, type
`Get-Service | Get-Member`.

### Example 6: List the services on the computer that have dependent services

This example gets services that have dependent services.

```powershell
Get-Service |
  Where-Object {$_.DependentServices} |
    Format-List -Property Name, DependentServices, @{
      Label="NoOfDependentServices"; Expression={$_.dependentservices.count}
    }
```

```Output
Name                  : AudioEndpointBuilder
DependentServices     : {AudioSrv}
NoOfDependentServices : 1

Name                  : Dhcp
DependentServices     : {WinHttpAutoProxySvc}
NoOfDependentServices : 1
...
```

The `Get-Service` cmdlet gets all the services on the computer and sends the objects down the
pipeline. The `Where-Object` cmdlet selects the services whose **DependentServices** property isn't
null.

The results are sent down the pipeline to the `Format-List` cmdlet. The **Property** parameter
displays the name of the service, the name of the dependent services, and a calculated property that
displays the number of dependent services for each service.

### Example 7: Sort services by property value

This example shows that when you sort services in ascending order by the value of their **Status**
property, stopped services appear before running services. The reason is because the value of
**Status** is an enumeration, in which Stopped has a value of 1, and Running has a value of 4. For
more information, see
[ServiceControllerStatus](/dotnet/api/system.serviceprocess.servicecontrollerstatus).

To list running services first, use the **Descending** parameter of the `Sort-Object` cmdlet.

```powershell
Get-Service "s*" | Sort-Object status
```

```Output
Status   Name               DisplayName
------   ----               -----------
Stopped  stisvc             Windows Image Acquisition (WIA)
Stopped  SwPrv              MS Software Shadow Copy Provider
Stopped  SysmonLog          Performance Logs and Alerts
Running  Spooler            Print Spooler
Running  srservice          System Restore Service
Running  SSDPSRV            SSDP Discovery Service
Running  ShellHWDetection   Shell Hardware Detection
Running  Schedule           Task Scheduler
Running  SCardSvr           Smart Card
Running  SamSs              Security Accounts Manager
Running  SharedAccess       Windows Firewall/Internet Connectio...
Running  SENS               System Event Notification
Running  seclogon           Secondary Logon
```

### Example 8: Get the dependent services of a service

This example gets the services that the WinRM service requires. The value of the service's
**ServicesDependedOn** property is returned.

```powershell
Get-Service "WinRM" -RequiredServices
```

### Example 9: Get a service through the pipeline operator

This example gets the WinRM service on the local computer. The service name string, enclosed in
quotation marks, is sent down the pipeline to `Get-Service`.

```powershell
"WinRM" | Get-Service
```

[about_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController, System.String

You can pipe a service object or a service name to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController

This cmdlet returns objects that represent the services on the computer.

## NOTES

Beginning in PowerShell 6.0, the following properties are added to the **ServiceController**
objects: **UserName**, **Description**, **DelayedAutoStart**, **BinaryPathName**, and
**StartupType** .

You can also refer to `Get-Service` by its built-in alias, `gsv`. For more information, see
[about_Aliases](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Aliases.md).

This cmdlet can display services only when the current user has permission to see them. If this
cmdlet does not display services, you might not have permission to see them.

To find the service name and display name of each service on your system, type `Get-Service`. The
service names appear in the Name column, and the display names appear in the **DisplayName** column.

When you sort in ascending order by the **Status** property's value, Stopped services appear before
Running services. The service's **Status** property is an enumerated value and the status names
represent integer values. The sort order is based on the integer value, not the name. Stopped
appears before because Running because Stopped has a value of 1, and Running has a value of 4. For
more information, see
[ServiceControllerStatus](/dotnet/api/system.serviceprocess.servicecontrollerstatus).
