# Copy-Item

## SYNOPSIS
Copies an item from one location to another.

## SYNTAX

### Path (Default)
```
Copy-Item [-Path] <String[]> [[-Destination] <String>] [-Container] [-Force] [-Filter <String>]
 [-Include <String[]>] [-Exclude <String[]>] [-Recurse] [-PassThru] [-Credential <PSCredential>]
 [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [-UseTransaction] [-FromSession <PSSession>] [-ToSession <PSSession>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### LiteralPath
```
Copy-Item -LiteralPath <String[]> [[-Destination] <String>] [-Container] [-Force] [-Filter <String>]
 [-Include <String[]>] [-Exclude <String[]>] [-Recurse] [-PassThru] [-Credential <PSCredential>]
 [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [-UseTransaction] [-FromSession <PSSession>] [-ToSession <PSSession>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Copy-Item** cmdlet copies an item from one location to another location in the same namespace.
For instance, it can copy a file to a folder, but it cannot copy a file to a certificate drive.

This cmdlet does not cut or delete the items being copied.
The particular items that the cmdlet can copy depend on the PowerShell provider that exposes the item.
For instance, it can copy files and directories in a file system drive and registry keys and entries in the registry drive.

This cmdlet can copy and rename items in the same command.
To rename an item, enter the new name in the value of the *Destination* parameter.
To rename an item and not copy it, use the Rename-Item cmdlet.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Copy a file to the specified directory
```powershell
PS C:\> Copy-Item "C:\Wabash\Logfiles\mar1604.log.txt" -Destination "C:\Presentation"
```

This command copies the mar1604.log.txt file to the C:\Presentation directory.
The command does not delete the original file.

### Example 2: Copy the contents of a directory to another directory
```powershell
PS C:\> Copy-Item "C:\Logfiles" -Destination "C:\Drawings" -Recurse
```

This command copies the entire contents of the Logfiles directory into the Drawings directory.
If the LogFiles directory contains files in subdirectories, those subdirectories are copied with their file trees intact.
The *Container* parameter is set to true by default.
This preserves the directory structure.

### Example 3: Copy the contents of a directory to another directory and create the destination directory if it does not exist
```powershell
PS C:\> Copy-Item C:\Logfiles -Destination C:\Drawings\Logs -Recurse
```

This command copies the contents of the C:\Logfiles directory to the C:\Drawings\Logs directory.
It creates the \Logs subdirectory if it does not already exist.

### Example 4: Copy a file to the specified directory and rename the file
```powershell
PS C:\> Copy-Item "\\Server01\Share\Get-Widget.ps1" -Destination "\\Server12\ScriptArchive\Get-Widget.ps1.txt"
```

This command uses the **Copy-Item** cmdlet to copy the Get-Widget.ps1 script from the \\\\Server01\Share directory to the \\\\Server12\ScriptArchive directory.
As part of the copy operation, the command also changes the item name from Get-Widget.ps1 to Get-Widget.ps1.txt, so it can be attached to email messages.

### Example 5: Copy a file to a remote computer
```powershell
PS C:\> $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Server01" -Credential "Contoso\PattiFul"
PS C:\> Copy-Item "D:\Folder001\test.log" -Destination "C:\Folder001_Copy\" -ToSession $Session
```

The first command creates a session to the remote computer named Server01 with the credential of Contoso\PattiFul and stores the results in the variable named $Session.

The second command uses the **Copy-Item** cmdlet to copy test.log from the D:\Folder001 folder to the C:\Folder001_Copy folder on the remote computer using the session information stored in the $Session variable.
This command does not delete the original file.

### Example 6: Copy the entire contents of a folder to a remote computer
```powershell
PS C:\> $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Server02" -Credential "Contoso\PattiFul"
PS C:\> Copy-Item "D:\Folder002\" -Destination "C:\Folder002_Copy\" -ToSession $Session
```

The first command creates a session to the remote computer named Server01 with the credential of Contoso\PattiFul and stores the results in the variable named $Session.

The second command uses the **Copy-Item** cmdlet to copy the entire contents from the D:\Folder002 folder to the C:\Folder002_Copy directory on the remote computer using the session information stored in the $Session variable.
The subfolders are copied with their file trees intact.

### Example 7: Recursively copy the entire contents of a folder to a remote computer
```powershell
PS C:\> $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Server04" -Credential "Contoso\PattiFul"
PS C:\> Copy-Item "D:\Folder003\" -Destination "C:\Folder003_Copy\" -ToSession $Session -Recurse
```

The first command creates a session to the remote computer named Server01 with the credential of Contoso\PattiFul and stores the results in the variable named $Session.

The second command uses the **Copy-Item** cmdlet to copy the entire contents from the D:\Folder003 folder to the C:\Folder003_Copy directory on the remote computer using the session information stored in the $Session variable.
The subfolders are copied with their file trees intact.
Since this command uses the *Recurse* parameter, the operation creates the Folder003_Copy folder if it does not already exist.

### Example 8: Copy a file to a remote computer and then rename the file
```powershell
PS C:\> $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Server04" -Credential "Contoso\PattiFul"
PS C:\> Copy-Item "D:\Folder004\scriptingexample.ps1" -Destination "C:\Folder004_Copy\scriptingexample_copy.ps1" -ToSession $Session
```

The first command creates a session to the remote computer named Server01 with the credential of Contoso\PattiFul and stores the results in the variable named $Session.

The second command uses the **Copy-Item** cmdlet to copy scriptingexample.ps1 from the D:\Folder004 folder to the C:\Folder004_Copy folder on the remote computer using the session information stored in the $Session variable.
As part of the copy operation, the command also changes the item name from scriptingexample.ps1 to scriptingexample_copy.ps1, so it can be attached to email messages.
This command does not delete the original file.

### Example 9: Copy a remote file to the local computer
```powershell
PS C:\> $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Server01" -Credential "Contoso\PattiFul"
PS C:\> Copy-Item "C:\MyRemoteData\test.log" -Destination "D:\MyLocalData\" -FromSession $Session
```

The first command creates a session to the remote computer named Server01 with the credential of Contoso\PattiFul and stores the results in the variable named $Session.

The second command uses the **Copy-Item** cmdlet to copy test.log from the remote C:\MyRemoteData\ to the local D:\MyLocalData folder using the session information stored in the $Session variable.
This command does not delete the original file.

### Example 10: Copy the entire contents of a remote folder to the local computer
```powershell
PS C:\> $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Server01" -Credential "Contoso\PattiFul"
PS C:\> Copy-Item "C:\MyRemoteData\scripts" -Destination "D:\MyLocalData\" -FromSession $Session
```

The first command creates a session to the remote computer named Server01 with the credential of Contoso\PattiFul and stores the results in the variable named $Session.

The second command uses the **Copy-Item** cmdlet to copy the entire contents from the remote C:\MyRemoteData\scripts folder to the local D:\MyLocalData folder using the session information stored in the $Session variable.
If the scripts folder contains files in subfolders, those subfolders are copied with their file trees intact.

### Example 11: Recursively copy the entire contents of a remote folder to the local computer
```powershell
PS C:\> $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Server01" -Credential "Contoso\PattiFul"
PS C:\> Copy-Item "C:\MyRemoteData\scripts" -Destination "D:\MyLocalData\scripts" -FromSession $Session -Recurse
```

The first command creates a session to the remote computer named Server01 with the credential of Contoso\PattiFul and stores the results in the variable named $Session.

The second command uses the **Copy-Item** cmdlet to copy the entire contents from the remote C:\MyRemoteData\scripts folder to the local D:\MyLocalData\scripts folder using the session information stored in the $Session variable.
Since this command uses the *Recurse* parameter, the operation creates the scripts folder if it does not already exist. If the scripts folder contains files in subfolders, those subfolders are copied with their file trees intact.

## PARAMETERS

### -Container
Indicates that this cmdlet preserves container objects during the copy operation.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential
Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
The default is the current user.

Type a user name, such as User01 or Domain01\User01, or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one generated by the Get-Credential cmdlet.
If you type a user name, you are prompted for a password.

This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with PowerShell.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Destination
Specifies the path to the new location.
To rename a copied item, include the new name in the value.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 2
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Exclude
Specifies, as a string array, an item or items that this cmdlet excludes from the operation.
Wildcards are permitted.

Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Filter
Specifies a filter in the provider's format or language.
The value of this parameter qualifies the *Path* parameter.
The syntax of the filter, including the use of wildcards, depends on the provider.
Filters are more efficient than other parameters, because the provider applies them when the cmdlet gets the objects, rather than have PowerShell filter the objects after they are retrieved.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
Indicates that this cmdlet copies items that cannot otherwise be changed, such as copying over a read-only file or alias.

```yaml

Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LiteralPath
Specifies a path to the item.
The value of the *LiteralPath* parameter is used exactly as it is typed.
No characters are interpreted as wildcards.
If the path includes escape characters, enclose it in single quotation marks.
Single quotation marks tell PowerShell not to interpret any characters as escape sequences.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: LiteralPath
Aliases: PSPath

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False

Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Path
Specifies, as a string array, the path to the items to copy.

```yaml
Type: String[]

Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Recurse
Indicates that this cmdlet performs a recursive copy.
