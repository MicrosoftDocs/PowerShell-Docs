# Suspend-Service

## SYNOPSIS
Suspends (pauses) one or more running services.

## SYNTAX

### InputObject (Default)
```
Suspend-Service [-InputObject] <ServiceController[]> [-PassThru] [-Include <String[]>] [-Exclude <String[]>]
 [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Default
```
Suspend-Service [-Name] <String[]> [-PassThru] [-Include <String[]>] [-Exclude <String[]>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

### DisplayName
```
Suspend-Service [-PassThru] -DisplayName <String[]> [-Include <String[]>] [-Exclude <String[]>] [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Suspend-Service** cmdlet sends a suspend message to the Windows Service Controller for each of the specified services.
While suspended, the service is still running, but its action is stopped until resumed, such as by usingthe Resume-Service cmdlet.
You can specify the services by their service names or display names, or you can use the *InputObject* parameter to pass a service object that represents the services that you want to suspend.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Suspend a service
```
PS C:\> Suspend-Service -DisplayName "Telnet"
```

This command suspends the Telnet service (Tlntsvr) service on the local computer.

### Example 2: Display what would happen if you suspend services
```
PS C:\> Suspend-Service -Name lanman* -WhatIf
```

This command tells what would happen if you suspended the services that have a service name that starts with lanman.
To suspend the services, rerun the command without the *WhatIf* parameter.

### Example 3: Get and suspend a service
```
PS C:\> Get-Service schedule | Suspend-Service
```

This command uses the **Get-Service** cmdlet to get an object that represents the Task Scheduler (Schedule) service on the computer.
The pipeline operator (|) passes the result to **Suspend-Service**, which suspends the service.

### Example 4: Suspend all services that can be suspended
```
PS C:\> Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.CanPauseAndContinue -eq "True"} | Suspend-Service -Confirm
```

This command suspends all of the services on the computer that can be suspended.
It uses **Get-Service** to get objects that represent the services on the computer.
The pipeline operator passes the results to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only the services that have a value of $True for the **CanPauseAndContinue** property.
Another pipeline operator passes the results to **Suspend-Service**.
The *Confirm* parameter prompts you for confirmation before suspending each of the services.

### CommonParameters

## INPUTS

### System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController, System.String
You can pipe a service object or a string that contains a service name to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### None, System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController
This cmdlet generates a **System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController** object that represents the service, if you specify the *PassThru* parameter.
Otherwise, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

## NOTES
* **Suspend-Service** can control services only when the current user has permission to do this. If a command does not work correctly, you might not have the required permissions.
* **Suspend-Service** can suspend only services that support being suspended and resumed. To determine whether a particular service can be suspended, use the Get-Service cmdlet together with the **CanPauseAndContinue** property. For example, `Get-Service wmi | Format-List Name, CanPauseAndContinue`. To find all services on the computer that can be suspended, type `Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.CanPauseAndContinue -eq "True"}`.
* To find the service names and display names of the services on your system, type **Get-Service**. The service names appear in the **Name** column, and the display names appear in the **DisplayName** column.
