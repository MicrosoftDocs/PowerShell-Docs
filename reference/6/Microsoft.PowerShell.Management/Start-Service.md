# Start-Service

## SYNOPSIS
Starts one or more stopped services.

## SYNTAX

### InputObject (Default)
```
Start-Service [-InputObject] <ServiceController[]> [-PassThru] [-Include <String[]>] [-Exclude <String[]>]
 [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Default
```
Start-Service [-Name] <String[]> [-PassThru] [-Include <String[]>] [-Exclude <String[]>]
 [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### DisplayName
```
Start-Service [-PassThru] -DisplayName <String[]> [-Include <String[]>] [-Exclude <String[]>]
 [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Start-Service** cmdlet sends a start message to the Windows Service Controller for each of the specified services.
If a service is already running, the message is ignored without error.
You can specify the services by their service names or display names, or you can use the *InputObject* parameter to supply a service object that represents the services that you want to start.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Start a service by using its name
```
PS C:\> Start-Service -Name "eventlog"
```

This command starts the EventLog service on the local computer.
It uses the *Name* parameter to identify the service by its service name.

### Example 2: Display information without starting a service
```
PS C:\> Start-Service -DisplayName *remote* -WhatIf
```

This command tells what would occur if you started the services that have a display name that includes remote.
It uses the *DisplayName* parameter to specify the services by their display name instead of by their service name.
And, the command uses the *WhatIf* parameter.
That parameter means that this command displays what would occur if you run the command without making changes.

### Example 3: Start a service and record the action in a text file
```
PS C:\> $s = Get-Service wmi
PS C:\> Start-Service -InputObject $s -PassThru | Format-List >> services.txt
```

These commands start the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service on the computer and add a record of the action to the services.txt file.
The first command uses **Get-Service** to get an object that represent the WMI service and store it in the $s variable.

The second command starts the WMI service.
It identifies the service by using the *InputObject* parameter to pass the $s variable that contains the WMI service object to **Start-Service**.
Then, it uses *PassThru* to create an object that represents the starting of the service.
Without *PassThru*, **Start-Service** does not create any output.

The pipeline operator (|) passes the object that **Start-Service** creates to the Format-List cmdlet, which formats the object as a list of its properties.
The append redirection operator (\>\>) redirects the output to the services.txt file, where it is added to the end of the existing file.

### Example 4: Start a disabled service
```
PS C:\> Start-Service tlntsvr
Start-Service : Service 'Telnet (TlntSvr)' cannot be started due to the    following error: Cannot start service TlntSvr on computer '.'.
At line:1 char:14
+ start-service  <<<< tlntsvr PS C:\> Get-WMIObject win32_service | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "tlntsvr"}
ExitCode  : 0
Name      : TlntSvr
ProcessId : 0
StartMode : Disabled
State     : Stopped
Status    : OK PS C:\> Set-Service tlntsvr -StartupType manual PS C:\> start-service tlntsvr
```

This series of commands shows how to start a service when the start type of the service is Disabled.
The first command, which attempts to start the Telnet service (tlntsvr), fails.

The second command uses **Get-WmiObject** to get the Tlntsvr service.
This command retrieves an object that has the start type property in the **StartMode** field.
The resulting display reveals that the start type of the Tlntsvr service is Disabled.

The next command uses **Set-Service** to change the start type of the Tlntsvr service to "Manual".

Now, we can resubmit the **Start-Service** command.
This time, the command succeeds.

To verify that the command succeeded, run **Get-Service**.

## PARAMETERS

```

### -PassThru

Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False

Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController, System.String
You can pipe objects that represent the services or strings that contain the service names to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### None, System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController
This cmdlet generates a **System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController** object that represents the service, if you specify *PassThru*.
Otherwise, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

## NOTES
* You can also refer to **Start-Service** by its built-in alias, **sasv**. For more information, see about_Aliases.
* **Start-Service** can control services only if the current user has permission to do this. If a command does not work correctly, you might not have the required permissions.
* To find the service names and display names of the services on your system, type `Get-Service`. The service names appear in the **Name** column, and the display names appear in the **DisplayName** column.
* You can start only the services that have a start type of Manual or Automatic. You cannot start the services that have a start type of Disabled. If a **Start-Service** command fails with the message `Cannot start service \<service-name\> on computer`, use Get-WmiObject to find the start type of the service and, if you have to, use the Set-Service cmdlet to change the start type of the service.
* Some services, such as Performance Logs and Alerts (SysmonLog) stop automatically if they have no work to do. When PowerShell starts a service that stops itself almost immediately, it displays the following message: `Service \<display-name\> start failed.`
