# Clear-Item

## SYNOPSIS
Clears the contents of an item, but does not delete the item.

## SYNTAX

### Path (Default)

```
Clear-Item [-Path] <String[]> [-Force] [-Filter <String>] [-Include <String[]>] [-Exclude <String[]>]
 [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### LiteralPath

```
Clear-Item -LiteralPath <String[]> [-Force] [-Filter <String>] [-Include <String[]>] [-Exclude <String[]>]
 [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Clear-Item` cmdlet clears the content of an item, but it does not delete the item.
For example, the `Clear-Item` cmdlet can delete the value of a variable, but it does not delete the
variable. The value that used to represent a cleared item is defined by each PowerShell provider.
This cmdlet is similar to `Clear-Content`, but it works on aliases and variables, instead of files.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Clear the value of a variable

This command clears the value of the variable named `TestVar1`.
The variable remains and is valid, but its value is set to `$null`.
The variable name is prefixed with `Variable:` to indicate the PowerShell Variable provider.

The alternate commands show that, to get the same result, you can switch to the PowerShell `Variable:` drive and then run the `Clear-Item` command.

```powershell
Clear-Item Variable:TestVar1
```

```
Set-Location Variable:
PS Variable:\> Clear-Item TestVar1
```

### Example 2: Clear all registry entries

This command clears all registry entries in the "MyKey" subkey, but only after prompting you to confirm your intent.
It does not delete the "MyKey" subkey or affect any other registry keys or entries.
You can use the **Include** and **Exclude** parameters to identify particular registry keys, but you cannot use them to identify registry entries.

- To delete particular registry entries, use the `Remove-ItemProperty` cmdlet.
- To delete the value of a registry entry, use the `Clear-ItemProperty cmdlet`.

```powershell
Clear-Item HKLM:\Software\MyCompany\MyKey -Confirm
```

## PARAMETERS

### -Credential

> [!NOTE]
> This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with PowerShell.
> To impersonate another user, or elevate your credentials when running this cmdlet,
> use [Invoke-Command](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/Invoke-Command.md).

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Current user
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Exclude

Specifies, as a string array, an item or items that this cmdlet excludes in the operation. The value
of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter. Enter a path element or pattern, such as
`*.txt`. Wildcard characters are permitted. The **Exclude** parameter is effective only when the
command includes the contents of an item, such as `C:\Windows\*`, where the wildcard character
specifies the contents of the `C:\Windows` directory.

```yaml
Type: System.String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -Filter

Specifies a filter to qualify the **Path** parameter. The [FileSystem](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_FileSystem_Provider.md)
provider is the only installed PowerShell provider that supports the use of filters. You can find
the syntax for the **FileSystem** filter language in [about_Wildcards](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Wildcards.md).
Filters are more efficient than other parameters, because the provider applies them when the cmdlet
gets the objects rather than having PowerShell filter the objects after they are retrieved.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -Force

Indicates that the cmdlet clears items that cannot otherwise be changed, such as read- only aliases.
The cmdlet cannot clear constants.
Implementation varies from provider to provider.
For more information, see [about_Providers](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Providers.md).
The cmdlet cannot override security restrictions, even when the **Force** parameter is used.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Include

Specifies, as a string array, an item or items that this cmdlet includes in the operation. The value
of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter. Enter a path element or pattern, such as
`"*.txt"`. Wildcard characters are permitted. The **Include** parameter is effective only when the
command includes the contents of an item, such as `C:\Windows\*`, where the wildcard character
specifies the contents of the `C:\Windows` directory.

```yaml
Type: System.String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -LiteralPath

Specifies a path to one or more locations. The value of **LiteralPath** is used exactly as it is
typed. No characters are interpreted as wildcards. If the path includes escape characters, enclose
it in single quotation marks. Single quotation marks tell PowerShell not to interpret any characters
as escape sequences.

For more information, see [about_Quoting_Rules](../Microsoft.Powershell.Core/About/about_Quoting_Rules.md).

```yaml
Type: System.String[]
Parameter Sets: LiteralPath
Aliases: PSPath, LP

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Path

Specifies the path to the items being cleared.
Wildcard characters are permitted.
This parameter is required, but the parameter name **Path** is optional.

```yaml
Type: System.String[]
Parameter Sets: Path
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -Confirm

Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: `-Debug`, `-ErrorAction`, `-ErrorVariable`,
`-InformationAction`, `-InformationVariable`, `-OutVariable`, `-OutBuffer`, `-PipelineVariable`,
`-Verbose`, `-WarningAction`, and `-WarningVariable`. For more information, see
[about_CommonParameters](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_CommonParameters.md).

## INPUTS

### System.String

You can pipe a path string to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### None

This cmdlet does not generate any output.

## NOTES

- The `Clear-Item` cmdlet is supported only by several PowerShell providers, including the **Alias**,
  **Environment**, **Function**, **Registry**, and **Variable** providers. As such, you can use
  `Clear-Item` to delete the content of items in the provider namespaces. To list the providers
  available in your session, type `Get-PsProvider`. For more information, see [about_Providers](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Providers.md).
- You cannot use `Clear-Item` to delete the contents of a file, because the PowerShell FileSystem
  provider does not support this cmdlet. To clear files, use the `Clear-Content`.
