# Clear-Item

## SYNOPSIS
Clears the contents of an item, but does not delete the item.

## SYNTAX

### Path (Default)
```
Clear-Item [-Path] <String[]> [-Force] [-Filter <String>] [-Include <String[]>] [-Exclude <String[]>]
 [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [-UseTransaction] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### LiteralPath
```
Clear-Item -LiteralPath <String[]> [-Force] [-Filter <String>] [-Include <String[]>] [-Exclude <String[]>]
 [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [-UseTransaction] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Clear-Item** cmdlet clears the content of an item, but it does not delete the item.
For example, the **Clear-Item** cmdlet can delete the value of a variable, but it does not delete the variable.
The value that used to represent a cleared item is defined by each PowerShell provider.
This cmdlet is similar to Clear-Content, but it works on aliases and variables, instead of files.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Clear the value of a variable
```
PS C:\> Clear-Item Variable:TestVar1
-or-
PS C:> Set-location Variable:
PS Variable:\> Clear-Item TestVar1
```

This command clears the value of the variable named TestVar1.
The variable remains and is valid, but its value is set to null.
The variable name is prefixed with Variable: to indicate the PowerShell Variable provider.

The alternate commands show that, to get the same result, you can switch to the PowerShell Variable: drive and then run the **Clear-Item** command.

### Example 2: Clear all registry entries
```
PS C:\> Clear-Item HKLM:\Software\MyCompany\MyKey -Confirm
```

This command clears all registry entries in the MyKey subkey, but only after prompting you to confirm your intent.
It does not delete the MyKey subkey or affect any other registry keys or entries.
You can use the **Include** and **Exclude** parameters to identify particular registry keys, but you cannot use them to identify registry entries.
To delete particular registry entries, use the Remove-ItemProperty cmdlet.
To delete the value of a registry entry, use the Clear-ItemPropertycmdlet.

## PARAMETERS

### -Credential
Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
The default is the current user.

Type a user name, such as User01 or Domain01\User01, or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one generated by the Get-Credential cmdlet.
If you type a user name, you will be prompted for a password.

This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with PowerShell.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Exclude
Specifies, as a string array, items to exclude.
The value of this parameter qualifies the *Path* parameter.
Enter a path element or pattern, such as *.txt.
Wildcards are permitted.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Filter
Specifies a filter in the provider's format or language.
The value of this parameter qualifies the *Path* parameter.
The syntax of the filter, including the use of wildcards, depends on the provider.
Filters are more efficient than other parameters, because the provider applies them when the cmdlet gets the objects, rather than having PowerShell filter the objects after they are retrieved.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
Indicates that the cmdlet clears items that cannot otherwise be changed, such as read- only aliases.
The cmdlet cannot clear constants.
Implementation varies from provider to provider.
For more information, see about_Providers.
The cmdlet cannot override security restrictions, even when the *Force* parameter is used.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Include
Specifies, as a string array, items to that this cmdlet clears.
The value of this parameter qualifies the *Path* parameter.
Enter a path element or pattern, such as *.txt.
Wildcards are permitted.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LiteralPath
Specifies the path to the items being cleared.
Unlike *Path*, the value of the *LiteralPath* parameter is used exactly as it is typed.
No characters are interpreted as wildcards.
If the path includes escape characters, enclose it in single quotation marks.
Single quotation marks tell *wps_2* not to interpret any characters as escape sequences.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: LiteralPath
Aliases: PSPath

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Path
Specifies the path to the items being cleared.
Wildcards are permitted.
This parameter is required, but the parameter name (Path) is optional.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: Path
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm
Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf
Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UseTransaction
Includes the command in the active transaction.
This parameter is valid only when a transaction is in progress.
For more information, see Includes the command in the active transaction.
This parameter is valid only when a transaction is in progress.
For more information, see

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: usetx

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### System.String
You can pipe a path string to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### None
This cmdlet does not generate any output.

## NOTES
* The **Clear-Item** cmdlet is supported only by several PowerShell providers, including the Alias, Environment, Function, Registry, and Variable providers. As such, you can use **Clear-Item** to delete the content of items in the provider namespaces.

  You cannot use **Clear-Item** to delete the contents of a file, because the PowerShell FileSystem provider does not support this cmdlet.
To clear files, use the **Clear-Content**.

  You can also refer to **Clear-Item** by its built-in alias, cli.
For more information, type `Get-Help about_Aliases`.

  The Clear-Item cmdlet is designed to work with the data exposed by any provider.
To list the providers available in your session, type "Get-PsProvider".
For more information, see about_Providers.
