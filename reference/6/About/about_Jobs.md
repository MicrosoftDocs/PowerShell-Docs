# About Jobs
## about_Jobs



# SHORT DESCRIPTION

Provides information about how Windows PowerShell background jobs run a
command or expression in the background without interacting with the
current session.

# LONG DESCRIPTION

This topic explains how to run background jobs in Windows PowerShell on a
local computer. For information about running background jobs on remote
computers, see about_Remote_Jobs.

When you start a background job, the command prompt returns immediately,
even if the job takes an extended time to complete. You can continue to
work in the session without interruption while the job runs.

# THE JOB CMDLETS


Start-Job        Starts a background job on a local computer.

Get-Job          Gets the background jobs that were started in the current
session.

Receive-Job      Gets the results of background jobs.

Stop-Job         Stops a background job.

Wait-Job         Suppresses the command prompt until one or all jobs are
complete.

Remove-Job       Deletes a background job.

Invoke-Command   The AsJob parameter runs any command as a background job on a
remote computer. You can also use Invoke-Command to run
any job command remotely, including a Start-Job command.

# HOW TO START A JOB ON THE LOCAL COMPUTER


To start a background job on the local computer, use the Start-Job
cmdlet.

To write a Start-Job command, enclose the command that the job runs in
braces ( { } ). Use the ScriptBlock parameter to specify the command.

The following command starts a background job that runs a Get-Process
command on the local computer.

Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-Process}

The Start-Job command returns an object that represents the job. The job
object contains useful information about the job, but it does not contain
the job results.

Save the job object in a variable, and then use it with the other Job
cmdlets to manage the background job. The following command starts a job
object and saves the resulting job object in the $job variable.

$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-Process}

You can also use the Get-Job cmdlet to get objects that represent the jobs
started in the current session. Get-Job returns the same job object that
Start-Job returns.

# GETTING JOB OBJECTS


To get object that represent the background jobs that were started in the
current session, use the Get-Job cmdlet. Without parameters, Get-Job
returns all of the jobs that were started in the current session.

For example, the following command gets the jobs in the current session.

PS C:> Get-Job

Id  Name  PSJobTypeName State      HasMoreData  Location   Command
--  ----  ------------- -----      -----------  --------   -------
1   Job1  BackgroundJob Running    True         localhost  Get-Process

You can also save the job object in a variable and use it to represent the
job in a later command. The following command gets the job with ID 1 and
saves it in the $job variable.

$job = Get-Job -Id 1

The job object contains the state of the job, which indicates whether the
job has finished. A finished job has a state of "Complete" or "Failed". A
job might also be blocked or running.

Get-Job

Id  Name  PSJobTypeName State      HasMoreData  Location   Command
--  ----  ------------- -----      -----------  --------   -------
1   Job1  BackgroundJob Complete   True         localhost  Get-Process

# GETTING THE RESULTS OF A JOB


When you run a background job, the results do not appear immediately.
Instead, the Start-Job cmdlet returns a job object that represents the
job, but it does not contain the results. To get the results of a
background job, use the Receive-Job cmdlet.

The following command uses the Receive-Job cmdlet to get the results of
the job. It uses a job object saved in the $job variable to identify the
job.

Receive-Job -Job $job

The Receive-Job cmdlet returns the results of the job.

Handles  NPM(K)    PM(K)      WS(K) VM(M)   CPU(s)    Id ProcessName
-------  ------    -----      ----- -----   ------    -- -----------

668       7     2672       6168   104    32.26   488 csrss
# ...


You can also save the results of a job in a variable. The following
command saves the results of the job in the $job variable to the $results
variable.

$results = Receive-Job -Job $job

And, you can save the results of the job in a file by using the redirection
operator (>) or the Out-File cmdlet. The following command uses the
redirection operator to save the results of the job in the $job variable in
the Results.txt file.

Receive-Job -Job $job > results.txt

# GETTING AND KEEPING PARTIAL JOB RESULTS


The Receive-Job cmdlet gets the results of a background job. If the
job is complete, Receive-Job gets all job results. If the job is still
running, Receive-Job gets the results that have been generated thus far.
You can run Receive-Job commands again to get the remaining results.

When Receive-Job returns results, by default, it deletes those results from
the cache where job results are stored. If you run another Receive-Job
command, you get only the results that are not yet received.

The following commands show the results of Receive-Job commands run
before the job is complete.

C:\PS> Receive-Job -Job $job

Handles  NPM(K)    PM(K)      WS(K) VM(M)   CPU(s)     Id ProcessName
-------  ------    -----      ----- -----   ------     -- -----------

1121      25    28408      32940   174   430.14   3048 explorer

To prevent Receive-Job from deleting the job results that it has
returned, use the Keep parameter. As a result, Receive-Job returns all
of the results that have been generated until that time.

The following commands show the effect of using the Keep parameter on a job
that is not yet complete.

C:\PS> Receive-Job -Job $job -Keep

# WAITING FOR THE RESULTS


If you run a command that takes a long time to complete, you can use
the properties of the job object to determine when the job is complete.
The following command uses the Get-Job object to get all of the background
jobs in the current session.

Get-Job

The results appear in a table. The status of the job appears in the State
column.

Id  Name  PSJobTypeName State      HasMoreData  Location   Command
--  ----  ------------- -----      -----------  --------   -------
1   Job1  BackgroundJob Complete    True         localhost  Get-Process
2   Job2  BackgroundJob Running     True         localhost  Get-EventLog -Log Syst...
3   Job3  BackgroundJob Complete    True         localhost  dir -Path C:\* -Recurse

In this case, the State property reveals that Job 2 is still running. If
you were to use the Receive-Job cmdlet to get the job results now, the
results would be incomplete. You can use the Receive-Job cmdlet
repeatedly to get all of the results. By default, each time you use it,
you get only the results that were not already received, but you can use
the Keep parameter of the Receive-Job cmdlet to retain the results, even
though they were already received.

You can write the partial results to a file and then append newer results
as they arrive or you can wait and check the state of the job later.

You can use the Wait parameter of the Receive-Job cmdlet, which
does not return the command prompt until the job is complete and all
results are available.

You can also use the Wait-Job cmdlet to wait for any or all of the results
of the job. Wait-Job lets you wait for a particular job, for all jobs, or
for any of the jobs to be completed.

The following command uses the Wait-Job cmdlet to wait for a job with
# ID 10.


Wait-Job -ID 10

As a result, the Windows PowerShell prompt is suppressed until the job
is completed.

You can also wait for a predetermined period of time. This command uses
the Timeout parameter to limit the wait to 120 seconds. When the time
expires, the command prompt returns, but the job continues to run in the
background.

Wait-Job -ID 10 -Timeout 120

# STOPPING A JOB


To stop a background job, use the Stop-Job cmdlet. The following command
starts a job to get every entry in the System event log. It saves the job
object in the $job variable.

$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-EventLog -Log System}

The following command stops the job. It uses a pipeline operator (|) to
send the job in the $job variable to Stop-Job.

$job | Stop-Job

# DELETING A JOB


To delete a background job, use the Remove-Job cmdlet. The following
command deletes the job in the $job variable.

Remove-Job -Job $job

# INVESTIGATING A FAILED JOB


To find out why a job failed, use the Reason subproperty of the job object.

The following command starts a job without the required credentials. It
saves the job object in the $job variable.

$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {New-Item -Path HKLM:\Software\MyCompany}

Id   Name  PSJobTypeName State    HasMoreData  Location   Command
--   ----  ------------- -----    -----------  --------   -------
1    Job1  BackgroundJob Failed   False        localhost  New-Item -Path HKLM:\S...

The following command uses the Reason property to find the error that
caused the job to fail.

$job.ChildJobs[0].JobStateInfo.Reason

In this case, the job failed because the remote computer required explicit
credentials to run the command. The value of the Reason property is:

Connecting to remote server failed with the following error
message : Access is denied.
