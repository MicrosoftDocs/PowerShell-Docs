# AfterEach

## SYNOPSIS
Defines a series of steps to perform at the end of every It block within
the current Context or Describe block.

## SYNTAX

AfterEach
```

## DESCRIPTION
BeforeEach, AfterEach, BeforeAll, and AfterAll are unique in that they apply
to the entire Context or Describe block, regardless of the order of the
statements in the Context or Describe.

with each other, please refer to the about_BeforeEach_AfterEach help file.
