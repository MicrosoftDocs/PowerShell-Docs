# Complete-Transaction

## SYNOPSIS
Commits the active transaction.

## SYNTAX

```
Complete-Transaction [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Complete-Transaction** cmdlet commits an active transaction.
When you commit a transaction, the commands in the transaction are finalized and the data affected by the commands is changed.

If the transaction includes multiple subscribers, to commit the transaction, you must enter one **Complete-Transaction** command for every Start-Transaction command.

The **Complete-Transaction** cmdlet is one of a set of cmdlets that support the transactions feature in Windows PowerShell.
For more information, see about_Transactions.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Commit a transaction
```
PS C:\> cd hkcu:\software
PS HKCU:\software> Start-Transaction
PS HKCU:\software> New-Item MyCompany -UseTransaction
PS HKCU:\software> dir m*
Hive: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\software

SKC  VC Name                           Property
---  -- ----                           --------
82   1 Microsoft                      {(default)}

PS HKCU:\software> Complete-Transaction
PS HKCU:\software> dir m*
Hive: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software

SKC  VC Name                           Property
---  -- ----                           --------
82   1 Microsoft                      {(default)}
0   0 MyCompany                      {}
```

This example shows what happens when you use the **Complete-Transaction** cmdlet to commit a transaction.

The **Start-Transaction** command starts the transaction.
The New-Item command uses the *UseTransaction* parameter to include the command in the transaction.

The first dir (Get-ChildItem) command shows that the new item has not yet been added to the registry.

The **Complete-Transaction** command commits the transaction, which makes the registry change effective.
As a result, the second dir command shows that the registry is changed.

### Example 2: Commit a transaction that has more than one subscriber
```
PS C:\> cd hkcu:\software
PS HKCU:\software> Start-Transaction
PS HKCU:\software> New-Item MyCompany -UseTransaction
Hive: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software

SKC  VC Name                           Property
---  -- ----                           --------
0   0 MyCompany                      {}

PS HKCU:\software> Start-Transaction
PS HKCU:\Software> Get-Transaction

RollbackPreference   SubscriberCount  Status
------------------   ---------------  ------
Error                2                Active

PS HKCU:\software> New-ItemProperty -Path MyCompany -Name MyKey -Value -UseTransaction

MyKey
-----
123

PS HKCU:\software> Complete-Transaction
PS HKCU:\software> Get-Transaction

RollbackPreference   SubscriberCount  Status
------------------   ---------------  ------
Error                1                Active

PS HKCU:\software> dir m*
Hive: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software

SKC  VC Name                           Property
---  -- ----                           --------
82   1 Microsoft                      {(default)}

PS HKCU:\software> Complete-Transaction
PS HKCU:\software> dir m*
Hive: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software

SKC  VC Name                           Property
---  -- ----                           --------
82   1 Microsoft                      {(default)}
0   1 MyCompany                      {MyKey}
```

This example shows how to use **Complete-Transaction** to commit a transaction that has more than one subscriber.

To commit a multi-subscriber transaction, you must enter one **Complete-Transaction** command for every **Start-Transaction** command.
The data is changed only when the final **Complete-Transaction** command is submitted.

For demonstration purposes, this example shows a series of commands entered at the command line.
In practice, transactions are likely to be run in scripts, with the secondary transaction being run by a function or helper script that is called by the main script.

In this example, a **Start-Transaction** command starts the transaction.
A **New-Item** command with the *UseTransaction* parameter adds the MyCompany key to the Software key.
Although the **New-Item** cmdlet returns a key object, the data in the registry is not yet changed.

A second **Start-Transaction** command adds a second subscriber to the existing transaction.
The **Get-Transaction** cmdlet confirms that the subscriber count is 2.
A New-ItemProperty command with the *UseTransaction* parameter adds a registry entry to the new MyCompany key.
Again, the command returns a value, but the registry is not changed.

The first **Complete-Transaction** command reduces the subscriber count by 1.
This is confirmed by a **Get-Transaction** command.
However, no data is changed, as evidenced by a dir m* (**Get-ChildItem**) command.

The second **Complete-Transaction** command commits the entire transaction and changes the data in the registry.
This is confirmed by a second dir m* command, which shows the changes.

### Example 3: Perform a transaction that does not change any data
```
PS C:\> cd hkcu:\software
PS HKCU:\software> Start-Transaction
PS HKCU:\software> New-Item MyCompany -UseTransaction
PS HKCU:\software> dir m*
Hive: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software

SKC  VC Name                           Property
---  -- ----                           --------
82   1 Microsoft                      {(default)}

PS HKCU:\software> dir m* -UseTransaction
Hive: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software

SKC  VC Name                           Property
---  -- ----                           --------
82   1 Microsoft                      {(default)}
0   0 MyCompany                      {}

PS HKCU:\software> Complete-Transaction
```

This example shows the value of using Get-* commands, and other commands that do not change data, in a transaction.
When a Get-* command is used in a transaction, it gets the objects that are part of the transaction.
This allows you to preview the changes in the transaction before the changes are committed.

In this example, a transaction is started.
A New-Item command with the *UseTransaction* parameter adds a new key to the registry as part of the transaction.

Because the new registry key is not added to the registry until the **Complete-Transaction** command is run, a simple dir (**Get-ChildItem**) command shows the registry without the new key.

However, when you add the *UseTransaction* parameter to the dir command, the command becomes part of the transaction, and it gets the items in the transaction even if they are not yet added to the data.

## OUTPUTS

### None
This cmdlet does not generate any output.

## NOTES
* You cannot roll back a transaction that has been committed, or commit a transaction that has been rolled back.

  You cannot roll back any transaction other than the active transaction.
To roll back a different transaction, you must first commit or roll back the active transaction.

  By default, if any part of a transaction cannot be committed, such as when a command in the transaction results in an error, the entire transaction is rolled back.
