    This example demonstrates the effect of changing the *RollbackPreference* parameter value.

    In the first set of commands, **Start-Transaction** does not use *RollbackPreference*.
    As a result, the default value (Error) is used.
    When an error occurs in a transaction command, that is, the specified path does not exist, the transaction is automatically rolled back.

    In the second set of commands, **Start-Transaction** uses *RollbackPreference* with a value of Never.
    As a result, when an error occurs in a transaction command, the transaction is still active and can be completed successfully.

    Because most transactions must be performed without error, the default value of *RollbackPreference* is typically preferred.

  description: |-
    This example shows the effect of using **Start-Transaction** while a transaction is in progress.
    The effect is much like joining the transaction in progress.

    Although this is a simplified command, this scenario frequently occurs when the transaction involves running a script that includes a complete transaction.

    The first **Start-Transaction** command starts the transaction.
    The first **New-Item** command is part of the transaction.

    The second **Start-Transaction** command adds a new subscriber to the transaction.
    The **Get-Transaction** command now returns a transaction with a subscriber count of 2.
    The second **New-Item** command is part of the same transaction.

    No changes are made to the registry until the whole transaction is completed.
    To complete the transaction, you must enter two **Complete-Transaction** commands, one for each subscriber.
    If you were to roll back the transaction at any point, all the transaction would be rolled back for both subscribers.

    This example shows the effect of using the *Independent* parameter of **Start-Transaction** to start a transaction while another transaction is in progress.
    In this case, the new transaction is rolled back without affecting the original transaction.

    Although the transactions are logically independent, because only one transaction can be active at a time, you must roll back or commit the newest transaction before resuming work on the original transaction.

    The first set of commands starts a transaction.
    The **New-Item** command is part of the first transaction.

    In the second set of commands, the **Start-Transaction** command uses the *Independent* parameter.
    The **Get-Transaction** command that follows shows the transaction object for the active transaction, which is the newest one.
    The subscriber count is equal to 1, that shows that the transactions are unrelated.

    When the active transaction is rolled back by using an **Undo-Transaction** command, the original transaction becomes active again.

    The **New-ItemProperty** command, which is part of the original transaction, finishes without error, and the original transaction can be completed by using the **Complete-Transaction** command.
    As a result, the registry is changed.

  description: |-
    This example demonstrates that commands that are submitted while a transaction is in progress can be included in the transaction or not included.
    Only commands that use the *UseTransaction* parameter are part of the transaction.

    The first and third **New-Item** commands use the *UseTransaction* parameter.
    These commands are part of the transaction.
    Because the second **New-Item** command does not use the *UseTransaction* parameter, it is not part of the transaction.

    The first dir command shows the effect.
    The second **New-Item** command is completed immediately, but the first and third **New-Item** commands are not effective until the transaction is committed.

    The **Complete-Transaction** command commits the transaction.
    As a result, the second dir command shows that all of the new items are added to the registry.

    This command uses the *Timeout* parameter of **Start-Transaction** to start a transaction that must be completed within two minutes.
    If the transaction is not finished when the time-out expires, it is rolled back automatically.

    When the time-out expires, you are not notified, but the **Status** property of the transaction object is set to RolledBack and commands that use the *UseTransaction* parameter fail.

  name: Independent
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet starts a transaction that is independent of any transactions in progress.
    By default, if you use **Start-Transaction** while another transaction is in progress, a new subscriber is added to the transaction in progress.
    This parameter has an effect only when a transaction is already in progress in the session.

    By default, if you use **Start-Transaction** while a transaction is in progress, the existing transaction object is reused and the subscriber count is incremented.
    The effect is much like joining the original transaction.
    An Undo-Transaction command rolls back the whole the transaction.
    To complete the transaction, you must enter a Complete-Transaction command for each subscriber.
    Because most transactions that are in progress at the same time are related, the default is sufficient for most uses.

    If you specify the *Independent* parameter, this cmdlet creates a new transaction that can be completed or undone without affecting the original transaction.
    However, because only one transaction can be active at a time, you must complete or roll back the new transaction before resuming work on the original transaction.

    Specifies the conditions under which a transaction is automatically rolled back.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Error.
    The transaction is rolled back automatically if a terminating or non-terminating error occurs.
    - TerminatingError.
    The transaction is rolled back automatically if a terminating error occurs.
    - Never.
    The transaction is never rolled back automatically.

    The default value is Error.

    Specifies the maximum time, in minutes, that the transaction is active.
    When the time-out expires, the transaction is automatically rolled back.

    By default, there is no time-out for transactions that are started at the command line.
    When transactions are started by a script, the default time-out is 30 minutes.

description: |-
  The **Start-Transaction** cmdlet starts a transaction, which is a series of commands that are managed as a unit.
  A transaction can be completed, or committed.
  Alternatively, it can be completely undone, or rolled back, so that any data changed by the transaction is restored to its original state.
  Because the commands in a transaction are managed as a unit, either all commands are committed or all commands are rolled back.

  By default, if any command in the transaction generates an error, transactions are rolled back automatically.
  You can use the *RollbackPreference* parameter to change this behavior.

  The cmdlets used in a transaction must be designed to support transactions.
  Cmdlets that support transactions have a *UseTransaction* parameter.
  To perform transactions in a provider, the provider must support transactions.
  The Windows PowerShell Registry provider in Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system supports transactions.
  You can also use the **Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management.TransactedString** class to include expressions in transactions on any version of the Windows system that supports Windows PowerShell.
  Other Windows PowerShell providers can also support transactions.

  Only one transaction can be active at a time.
  If you start a new, independent transaction while a transaction is in progress, the new transaction becomes the active transaction, and you must commit or roll back the new transaction before you make any changes to the original transaction.

  **Start-Transaction** cmdlet is one of a set of cmdlets that support the transactions feature in Windows PowerShell.
