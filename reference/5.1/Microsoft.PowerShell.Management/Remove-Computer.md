# Remove-Computer

## SYNOPSIS
Removes the local computer from its domain.

## SYNTAX

### Local (Default)
```
Remove-Computer [[-UnjoinDomainCredential] <PSCredential>] [-Restart] [-Force] [-PassThru]
 [-WorkgroupName <String>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Remote
```
Remove-Computer [-UnjoinDomainCredential] <PSCredential> [-LocalCredential <PSCredential>] [-Restart]
 [-ComputerName <String[]>] [-Force] [-PassThru] [-WorkgroupName <String>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Remove-Computer** cmdlet removes the local computer and remote computers from their current domains.

When you remove a computer from a domain, **Remove-Computer** also disables the domain account of the computer.
You must provide explicit credentials to unjoin the computer from its domain, even when they are the credentials of the current user.
You must restart the computer to make the change effective.
Also, when you remove a computer from a domain, you must move it to a workgroup.
Use the *WorkgroupName* parameter to specify the workgroup.

To move a computer from a workgroup to a domain, from one workgroup to another, or from one domain to another, use the Add-Computer cmdlet.

To get the results of the command, use the *Verbose* and *PassThru* parameters.
To suppress the user prompt, use the *Force* parameter.

**Remove-Computer** removes the local computer and remote computers from domains.
It includes credential parameters that specify alternate credentials for connecting to remote computers, and unjoining from a domain, a *Restart* parameter for restarting the affected computers, and a *WorkgroupName* parameter for specifying the name of the workgroup to which computers are added.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Remove the local computer from its domain
```
PS C:\> Remove-Computer -UnjoinDomaincredential Domain01\Admin01 -PassThru -Verbose -Restart
```

This command removes the local computer from the domain to which it is joined.

The command uses the *UnjoinDomainCredential* parameter to supply the credentials of a domain administrator.
It uses the *PassThru* parameter and the *Verbose* common parameter to display information about the success or failure of the command and the *Restart* parameter restart the computer, which is required to complete the remove operation.

Because the command does not specify a workgroup name, the local computer is moved to the WORKGROUP workgroup after it is removed from its domain.

### Example 2: Move several computers to a legacy workgroup
```
PS C:\> Remove-Computer -ComputerName (Get-Content OldServers.txt) -LocalCredential Domain01\Admin01 -UnJoinDomainCredential Domain01\Admin01 -WorkgroupName "Legacy" -Force -Restart
```

This command removes all of the computers that are listed in the OldServers.txt file from their domains and includes them in the Legacy workgroup.

The command uses the *LocalCredential* parameter to supply the credentials of a user who has permission to connect to remote computers and the *UnjoinDomainCredential* parameter to supply the credentials of a user who has permission to remove the computers from their domains.
It uses the *Force* parameter to suppress the confirmation prompts for each computer and the *Restart* parameter to restart each of the computers after it is removed from its domain.

### Example 3: Remove computers from a workgroup without confirmation
```
PS C:\> Remove-Computer -ComputerName "Server01", "localhost" -UnjoinDomainCredential Domain01\Admin01 -WorkgroupName "Local" -Restart -Force
```

This command removes the Server01 remote computer and the local computer from their domains and adds them to the Local workgroup.
It uses the *Force* parameter to suppress the confirmation prompt for each computer and the *Restart* parameter to restart the computers to make the change effective.

## PARAMETERS

### -ComputerName
Specifies the computers to be removed from their domains.
The default is the local computer.

Type the NetBIOS name, an IP address, or a fully qualified domain name of the remote computers.
To specify the local computer, type the computer name, a dot (.), or localhost.

This parameter does not rely on Windows PowerShell remoting.
You can use the *ComputerName* parameter of **Remove-Computer** even if your computer is not configured to run remote commands.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: Remote
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force
Suppresses the user prompt.

Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LocalCredential
Specifies a user account that has permission to connect to the computers that the *ComputerName* parameter specifies.
The default is the current user.

Type a user name, such as User01 or Domain01\User01, or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one generated by the Get-Credential cmdlet.
If you type a user name, this cmdlet prompts you for a password.
To specify a user account that has permission to remove the computer from its current domain, use the *UnjoinDomainCredential* parameter.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: Remote
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PassThru

### -Restart
Indicates that this cmdlet restarts the computers that were removed after the removal is completed.
A restart is often required to make the change effective.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml

Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UnjoinDomainCredential
Specifies a user account that has permission to remove the computers from their current domains.
Explicit credentials, as provided by this parameter, are required to remove remote computers from a domain, even when the value is the credentials of the current user.

Type a user name, such as User01 or Domain01\User01, or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one generated by **Get-Credential**.
If you type a user name, this cmdlet prompts you for a password.

You can refer to this parameter by its name, *UnjoinDomainCredential*, or its alias, *Credential*.

To specify a user account that has permission to connect to the remote computers, use the *LocalCredential* parameter.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential

### -WorkgroupName
Specifies the name of a workgroup to which the computers are added when they are removed from their domains.
