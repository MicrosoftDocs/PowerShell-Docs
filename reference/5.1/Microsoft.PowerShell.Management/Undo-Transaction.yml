### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Rolls back the active transaction.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
notes: |-
  * You cannot roll back a transaction that has been committed.

    You cannot roll back any transaction other than the active transaction.
  To roll back a different, independent transaction, you must first commit or roll back the active transaction.

    Rolling back the transaction ends the transaction.
  To use a transaction again, you must start a new transaction.

    This example demonstrates that when any subscriber rolls back a transaction, the whole transaction is rolled back for all subscribers.

    The first command changes the location to the HKCU:\Software registry key.

    The second command starts a transaction.

    The third command uses the New-Item cmdlet to create a new registry key.
    The command uses the *UseTransaction* parameter to include the change in the transaction.

    The fourth command uses the Get-Transaction cmdlet to get the active transaction.
    Notice that the status is Active and the subscriber count is 1.

    The fifth command uses the Start-Transaction command again.
    Typically, starting a transaction while another transaction is in progress occurs when a script that is used by the main transaction includes its own complete transaction.
    This example is performed interactively so that you can examine it in stages.
    When you run a **Start-Transaction** command while another transaction is in progress, the commands join the existing transaction as a new subscriber and the subscriber count is incremented.

    The sixth command uses the **Get-Transaction** cmdlet to get the active transaction.
    Notice that the subscriber count is now 2.

    The seventh command uses **Undo-Transaction** to roll back the transaction.
    This command does not return any objects.

    The final command is a **Get-Transaction** command that gets the active, or in this case, the most recently active, transaction.
    The results show that the transaction is rolled back, and that the subscriber count is 0, showing that the transaction was rolled back for all subscribers.

  The **Undo-Transaction** cmdlet rolls back the active transaction.
  When you roll back a transaction, the changes that were made by the commands in the transaction are discarded and the data is restored to its original form.

  If the transaction includes multiple subscribers, an **Undo-Transaction** command rolls back the whole transaction for all subscribers.

  By default, transactions are rolled back automatically if any command in the transaction generates an error.
  However, transactions can be started by using a different rollback preference and you can use this cmdlet to roll back the active transaction at any time.

  The **Undo-Transaction** cmdlet is one of a set of cmdlets that support the transactions feature in Windows PowerShell.
