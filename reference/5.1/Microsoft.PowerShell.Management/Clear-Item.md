# Clear-Item

## SYNOPSIS

Clears the contents of an item, but does not delete the item.

## SYNTAX

### Path (Default)

```
Clear-Item [-Path] <String[]> [-Force] [-Filter <String>] [-Include <String[]>] [-Exclude <String[]>]
 [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [-UseTransaction] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### LiteralPath

```
Clear-Item -LiteralPath <String[]> [-Force] [-Filter <String>] [-Include <String[]>] [-Exclude <String[]>]
 [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [-UseTransaction] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Clear-Item` cmdlet clears the content of an item, but it does not delete the item.
For example, the `Clear-Item` cmdlet can delete the value of a variable, but it does not delete the variable.
The value that used to represent a cleared item is defined by each PowerShell provider.
This cmdlet is similar to `Clear-Content`, but it works on aliases and variables, instead of files.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Clear the value of a variable

This command clears the value of the variable named `TestVar1`.
The variable remains and is valid, but its value is set to `$null`.
The variable name is prefixed with `Variable:` to indicate the PowerShell Variable provider.

The alternate commands show that, to get the same result, you can switch to the PowerShell `Variable:` drive and then run the `Clear-Item` command.

```powershell
Clear-Item Variable:TestVar1
```

```
Set-Location Variable:
PS Variable:\> Clear-Item TestVar1
```

### Example 2: Clear all registry entries

This command clears all registry entries in the "MyKey" subkey, but only after prompting you to confirm your intent.
It does not delete the "MyKey" subkey or affect any other registry keys or entries.
You can use the **Include** and **Exclude** parameters to identify particular registry keys, but you cannot use them to identify registry entries.

- To delete particular registry entries, use the `Remove-ItemProperty` cmdlet.
- To delete the value of a registry entry, use the `Clear-ItemPropertycmdlet`.

```powershell
Clear-Item HKLM:\Software\MyCompany\MyKey -Confirm
```

## PARAMETERS

### -Credential

Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
The default is the current user.

Type a user name, such as "User01" or "Domain01\User01", or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one generated by the `Get-Credential` cmdlet.
If you type a user name, you are prompted for a password.

> [!WARNING]
> This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with Windows PowerShell.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Current user
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Exclude

Specifies, as a string array, items to exclude.
The value of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter.
Enter a path element or pattern, such as *.txt.
Wildcard characters are permitted.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -Filter

Specifies a filter in the format or language of the provider.
The value of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter.

The syntax of the filter, including the use of wildcard characters, depends on the provider.
Filters are more efficient than other parameters, because the provider applies them when the cmdlet gets the objects rather than having PowerShell filter the objects after they are retrieved.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -Force

Indicates that the cmdlet clears items that cannot otherwise be changed, such as read- only aliases.
The cmdlet cannot clear constants.
Implementation varies from provider to provider.
For more information, see [about_Providers](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Providers.md).
The cmdlet cannot override security restrictions, even when the **Force** parameter is used.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Include

Specifies, as a string array, items to that this cmdlet clears.
The value of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter.
Enter a path element or pattern, such as "*.txt".
Wildcard characters are permitted.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -LiteralPath

Specifies the path to the items being cleared.
Unlike the **Path** parameter, the value of **LiteralPath** is used exactly as it is typed.
No characters are interpreted as wildcards.
If the path includes escape characters, enclose it in single quotation marks.
Single quotation marks tell PowerShell not to interpret any characters as escape sequences.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: LiteralPath
Aliases: PSPath

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Path

Specifies the path to the items being cleared.
Wildcards are permitted.
This parameter is required, but the parameter name (Path) is optional.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: Path
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UseTransaction

Includes the command in the active transaction.
This parameter is valid only when a transaction is in progress.
For more information, see about_Transactions.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: usetx

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: `-Debug`, `-ErrorAction`, `-ErrorVariable`, `-InformationAction`, `-InformationVariable`, `-OutVariable`, `-OutBuffer`, `-PipelineVariable`, `-Verbose`, `-WarningAction`, and `-WarningVariable`. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_CommonParameters.md).

## INPUTS

### System.String

You can pipe a path string to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### None

This cmdlet does not generate any output.

## NOTES

The `Clear-Item` cmdlet is supported only by several PowerShell providers, including the Alias, Environment, Function, Registry, and Variable providers. As such, you can use `Clear-Item` to delete the content of items in the provider namespaces. To list the providers available in your session, type `Get-PsProvider`. For more information, see [about_Providers](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Providers.md).

You cannot use `Clear-Item` to delete the contents of a file, because the PowerShell FileSystem provider does not support this cmdlet. To clear files, use the `Clear-Content`.
