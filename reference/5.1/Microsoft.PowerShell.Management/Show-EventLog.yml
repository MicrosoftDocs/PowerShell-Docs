    Specifies a remote computer.

    The default is the local computer.

    Type the NetBIOS name, an IP address, or a fully qualified domain name of a remote computer.

    This parameter does not rely on Windows PowerShell remoting.
    You can use the *ComputerName* parameter even if your computer is not configured to run remote commands.

description: |-
  The **Show-EventLog** cmdlet opens Event Viewer on the local computer and displays in it all of the classic event logs on the local computer or a remote computer.

  To open Event Viewer on Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system, the current user must be a member of the Administrators group on the local computer.

  The cmdlets that contain the **EventLog** noun (the **EventLog** cmdlets) work only on classic event logs.
  To get events from logs that use the Windows Event Log technology in Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system, use the Get-WinEvent cmdlet.
