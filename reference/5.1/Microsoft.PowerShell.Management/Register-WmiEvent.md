## DESCRIPTION
The **Register-WmiEvent** cmdlet subscribes to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) events on the local computer or on a remote computer.

When the subscribed WMI event is raised, it is added to the event queue in your local session even if the event occurs on a remote computer.
To get events in the event queue, use the Get-Eventcmdlet.

You can use the parameters of **Register-WmiEvent** to subscribe to events on remote computers and to specify the property values of the events that can help you identify the event in the queue.
You can also use the *Action* parameter to specify actions to take when a subscribed event is raised.

When you subscribe to an event, an event subscriber is added to your session.
To get the event subscribers in the session, use the Get-EventSubscriber cmdlet.
To cancel the subscription, use the Unregister-Event cmdlet, which deletes the event subscriber from the session.

New Common Information Model (CIM) cmdlets, introduced Windows PowerShell 3.0, perform the same tasks as the WMI cmdlets.
The CIM cmdlets comply with WS-Management (WSMan) standards and with the CIM standard, which enables the cmdlets to use the same techniques to manage computers that run the Windows operating system and those that run other operating systems.
Instead of using **Register-WmiEvent**, consider using the Register-CimIndicationEventhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=227960 cmdlet.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Subscribe to events generated by a class
```
PS C:\> Register-WmiEvent -Class 'Win32_ProcessStartTrace' -SourceIdentifier "ProcessStarted"
```

This command subscribes to the events generated by the **Win32_ProcessStartTrace** class.
This class raises an event whenever a process starts.

### Example 2: Subscribe to creation events for a process
```
PS C:\> Register-WmiEvent -Query "select * from __instancecreationevent within 5 where targetinstance isa 'win32_process'" -SourceIdentifier "WMIProcess" -MessageData "Test 01" -TimeOut 500
```

This command uses a query to subscribe to Win32_process instance creation events.

### Example 3: Use an action to respond to an event
```
PS C:\> $action = { Get-History | where { $_.commandline -like "*start-process*" } | export-cliXml "commandHistory.clixml" }
PS C:\> Register-WmiEvent -Class 'Win32_ProcessStartTrace' -SourceIdentifier "ProcessStarted" -Action $action
Id    Name            State      HasMoreData   Location  Command
--    ----            -----      -----------   --------  -------
1     ProcessStarted  NotStarted False                   get-history | where {...
```

This example shows how to use an action to respond to an event.
In this case, when a process starts, any Start-Process commands in the current session are written to an XML file.

When you use the *Action* parameter, **Register-WmiEvent** returns a background job that represents the event action.
You can use the **Job** cmdlets, such as Get-Job and Receive-Job, to manage the event job.

For more information, see about_Jobs.

### Example 4: Register for events on a remote computer
```
PS C:\> Register-WmiEvent -Class 'Win32_ProcessStartTrace' -SourceIdentifier "Start" -Computername Server01
PS C:\> Get-Event -SourceIdentifier "Start"
```

This example registers for events on the Server01 remote computer.

WMI returns the events to the local computer and stores them in the event queue in the current session.
To retrieve the events, run a local **Get-Event** command.

## PARAMETERS

### -Action
Specifies commands that handle the events.
The commands in the *Action* parameter run when an event is raised instead of sending the event to the event queue.
Enclose the commands in braces ( { } ) to create a script block.

The value of *Action* can include the $Event, $EventSubscriber, $Sender, $EventArgs, and $Args automatic variables, which provide information about the event to the *Action* script block.
For more information, see about_Automatic_Variables.

When you specify an action, **Register-WmiEvent** returns an event job object that represents that action.
You can use the cmdlets that contain the **Job** noun (the **Job** cmdlets) to manage the event job.

```yaml
Type: ScriptBlock
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 101
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Class
Specifies the event to which you are subscribing.
Enter the WMI class that generates the events.
A *Class* or *Query* parameter is required in every command.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: class
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ComputerName
Specifies the name of the computer on which the command runs.
The default is the local computer.

Type the NetBIOS name, an IP address, or a fully qualified domain name of the computer.
To specify the local computer, type the computer name, a dot (.), or localhost.

This parameter does not rely on Windows PowerShell remoting.
You can use the *ComputerName* parameter even if your computer is not configured to run remote commands.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: Cn

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential
Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
The default is the current user.

Type a user name, such as User01 or Domain01\User01, or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one generated by the Get-Credential cmdlet.
If you type a user name, this cmdlet prompts you for a password.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Forward
Indicates that this cmdlet sends events for this subscription to the session on the local computer.
Use this parameter when you are registering for events on a remote computer or in a remote session.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MaxTriggerCount

```

### -Query
Specifies a query in WMI Query Language (WQL) that identifies the WMI event class, such as: `select * from __InstanceDeletionEvent`.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: query
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SourceIdentifier
Specifies a name that you select for the subscription.
The name that you select must be unique in the current session.
The default value is the GUID that Windows PowerShell assigns.
