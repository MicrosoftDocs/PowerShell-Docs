# Show-EventLog

## SYNOPSIS
Displays the event logs of the local or a remote computer in Event Viewer.

## SYNTAX

```
Show-EventLog [[-ComputerName] <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Show-EventLog** cmdlet opens Event Viewer on the local computer and displays in it all of the classic event logs on the local computer or a remote computer.

To open Event Viewer on Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system, the current user must be a member of the Administrators group on the local computer.

The cmdlets that contain the **EventLog** noun (the **EventLog** cmdlets) work only on classic event logs.
To get events from logs that use the Windows Event Log technology in Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system, use the Get-WinEvent cmdlet.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Display event logs for the local computer
```
PS C:\> Show-EventLog
```

This command opens Event Viewer and displays in it the classic event logs on the local computer.

### Example 2: Display event logs for a remote computer
```
PS C:\> Show-EventLog -ComputerName "Server01"
```

This command opens Event Viewer and displays in it the classic event logs on the Server01 computer.

## PARAMETERS

Specifies a remote computer.
