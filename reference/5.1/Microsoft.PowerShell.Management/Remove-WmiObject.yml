examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Close all instances of a Win32 process'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> notepad
    PS C:\> $np = Get-WmiObject -Query "select * from win32_process where name='notepad.exe'"
    PS C:\> $np | Remove-WmiObject
  description: |-
    This example closes all the instances of Notepad.exe.

    The first command starts an instance of Notepad.

    The second command uses the Get-WmiObject cmdlet to retrieve the instances of the Win32_Process that correspond to Notepad.exe, and then stores them in the $np variable.

    The third command passes the object in the $np variable to **Remove-WmiObject**, which deletes all the instances of Notepad.exe.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Delete a folder'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $a = Get-WMIObject -Query "Select * From Win32_Directory Where Name ='C:\\Test'"
    PS C:\> $a | Remove-WMIObject
  description: |-
    This command deletes the C:\Test folder.

    The first command uses **Get-WMIObject** to query for the C:\Test folder, and then stores the object in the $a variable.

    The second command pipes the $a variable to **Remove-WMIObject**, which deletes the folder.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AsJob
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet run as a background job.
    Use this parameter to run commands that take a long time to finish.

    New CIM cmdlets, introduced Windows PowerShell 3.0, perform the same tasks as the WMI cmdlets.
    The CIM cmdlets comply with WS-Management (WSMan) standards and with the Common Information Model (CIM) standard, which enables the cmdlets to use the same techniques to manage computers that run the Windows operating system and those running other operating systems.
    Instead of using **Remove-WmiObject**, consider using the Remove-CimInstancehttps://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=227964 cmdlet.

    When you use the *AsJob* parameter, the command returns an object that represents the background job and then displays the command prompt.
    You can continue to work in the session while the job finishes.
    If **Remove-WmiObject** is used against a remote computer, the job is created on the local computer, and the results from remote computers are automatically returned to the local computer.
    To manage the job, use the cmdlets that contain the **Job** noun (the **Job** cmdlets).
    To get the job results, use the Receive-Job cmdlet.

    To use this parameter for remote computers, the local and remote computers must be configured for remoting.
    Start Windows PowerShell by using the Run as administrator option.
    For more information, see about_Remote_Requirements.

    For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see about_Jobs and about_Remote_Jobs.
