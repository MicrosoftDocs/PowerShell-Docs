  The **Disable-ComputerRestore** cmdlet turns off the System Restore feature on one or more file system drives.
  As a result, attempts to restore the computer do not affect the specified drive.

  To disable System Restore on any drive, it must be disabled on the system drive, either first or concurrently.

  To re-enable System Restore, use the Enable-ComputerRestore cmdlet.
  To find the state of System Restore for each drive, use Rstrui.exe.

  System restore points and the ComputerRestore cmdlets are supported only on client operating systems, such as Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP.
