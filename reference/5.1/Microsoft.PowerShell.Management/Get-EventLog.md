# Get-EventLog

## SYNOPSIS
Gets the events in an event log, or a list of the event logs, on the local or remote computers.

## SYNTAX

### LogName (Default)
```
Get-EventLog [-LogName] <String> [-ComputerName <String[]>] [-Newest <Int32>] [-After <DateTime>]
 [-Before <DateTime>] [-UserName <String[]>] [[-InstanceId] <Int64[]>] [-Index <Int32[]>]
 [-EntryType <String[]>] [-Source <String[]>] [-Message <String>] [-AsBaseObject] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### List
```
Get-EventLog [-ComputerName <String[]>] [-List] [-AsString] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-EventLog** cmdlet gets events and event logs on the local and remote computers.

You can use the parameters of this cmdlet to search for events by using their property values.
This cmdlet gets only the events that match the specified property values.

The cmdlets that contain the EventLog noun work only on classic event logs. To get events from logs that use the Windows Event Log technology in Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, use Get-WinEvent.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get event logs on the local computer
```
PS C:\> Get-EventLog -List
```

This command gets the event logs on the local computer.

### Example 2: Get the five most recent entries from a specific event log on the local computer
```
PS C:\> Get-EventLog -Newest 5 -LogName "Application"
```

This command gets the five most recent entries from the Application event log.

### Example 3: Find all sources that are represented in a specific number of entries in an event log
```
PS C:\> $Events = Get-Eventlog -LogName system -Newest 1000
PS C:\> $Events | Group-Object -Property source -noelement | Sort-Object -Property count -Descending

Count Name
----- ----
75    Service Control Manager
12    Print
6     UmrdpService
2     DnsApi
2     DCOM
1     Dhcp
1     TermDD
1     volsnap
```

This example shows how to find all of the sources that are represented in the 1000 most recent entries in the System event log.

The first command gets the 1,000 most recent entries from the System event log and stores them in the $Events variable.

The second command uses a pipeline operator (|) to send the events in $Events to the Group-Object cmdlet, which groups the entries by the value of the Source property sends the grouped events to the Sort-Object cmdlet, which sorts them in descending order, so the most frequently appearing source is listed first.

Source is just one property of event log entries.
To see all of the properties of an event log entry, pipe the event log entries to the Get-Member cmdlet.

### Example 4: Get error events from a specific event log
```
PS C:\> Get-EventLog -LogName System -EntryType Error
```

This command gets only error events from the System event log.

### Example 5: Get events from a specific event log with an Instance ID and Source value
```
PS C:\> Get-EventLog -LogName System -InstanceID 3221235481 -Source "DCOM"
```

This command gets events from the System log that have an InstanceID of 3221235481 and a Source value of DCOM.

### Example 6: Get event log events from multiple computers
```
PS C:\> Get-EventLog -LogName "Windows PowerShell" -ComputerName "localhost", "Server01", "Server02"
```

This command gets the events from the Windows PowerShell event log on three computers, Server01, Server02, and the local computer, known as localhost.

### Example 7: Get all events in an event log that have include a specific word in the message value
```
PS C:\> Get-EventLog -LogName "Windows PowerShell" -Message "*failed*"
```

This command gets all the events in the Windows PowerShell event log that have a message value that includes the word failed.

### Example 8: Display the property values of an event in a list
```
PS C:\> $A = Get-EventLog -Log System -Newest 1
PS C:\> $A | Format-List -Property *

EventID            : 7036
MachineName        : Server01
Data               : {}
Index              : 10238
Category           : (0)
CategoryNumber     : 0
EntryType          : Information
Message            : The description for Event ID
Source             : Service Control Manager
ReplacementStrings : {WinHTTP Web Proxy Auto-Disco
InstanceId         : 1073748860
TimeGenerated      : 4/11/2008 9:56:05 PM
TimeWritten        : 4/11/2008 9:56:05 PM
UserName           :
Site               :
Container          :
```

This example shows how to display the property values of an event in a list.

The first command gets the newest event from the System event log and saves it in the $A variable.

The second command uses a pipeline operator (|) to send the event in $a to the Format-List command, which displays all (*) of the event properties.

### Example 9: Get events from an event log with using a source and event ID
```
PS C:\> Get-EventLog -Log "Application" -Source "Outlook" | where {$_.eventID -eq 34}
```

This command gets events in the Application event log where the source is Outlook and the event ID is 34.
Even though this cmdlet does not have an *EventID* parameter, you can use the Where-Object cmdlet to select events based on the value of any event property.

### Example 10: Get events in an event log, grouped by a property
```
PS C:\> Get-EventLog -Log System -UserName "NT*" | Group-Object -Property "UserName" -noelement | Format-Table Count, Name -Auto

Count Name
----- ----
6031  NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
42    NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE
4     NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE
```

This command returns the events in the system log grouped by the value of their UserName property.
This command uses the *UserName* parameter to get only events in which the user name begins with NT*.

### Example 11: Get all errors in an event log that occurred during a specific time frame
```
PS C:\> $May31 = Get-Date 5/31/08
PS C:\> $July1 = Get-Date 7/01/08
PS C:\> Get-EventLog -Log "Windows PowerShell" -EntryType Error -After $May31 -before $July1
```

This command gets all of the errors in the Windows PowerShell event log that occurred in June 2008.
