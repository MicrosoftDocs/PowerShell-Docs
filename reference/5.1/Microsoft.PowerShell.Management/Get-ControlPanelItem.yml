  The `Get-ControlPanelItem` cmdlet gets control panel items on the local computer. You can use it
  to find control panel items by name, category, or description, even on systems that do not have a
  user interface.

  This cmdlet gets only the control panel items that can be opened on the system. On computers that do
  not have Control Panel or File Explorer, this cmdlet gets only control panel items that can open
  without these components.

  This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0. It works only on Windows 8 and Windows Server
  2012 and newer.
