# Get-HotFix

## SYNOPSIS
Gets the hotfixes that have been applied to the local and remote computers.

## SYNTAX

### Default (Default)
```
Get-HotFix [[-Id] <String[]>] [-ComputerName <String[]>] [-Credential <PSCredential>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Description
```
Get-HotFix [-Description <String[]>] [-ComputerName <String[]>] [-Credential <PSCredential>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-Hotfix** cmdlet gets hotfixes (also called updates) that have been installed on either the local computer (or on specified remote computers) by Windows Update, Microsoft Update, or Windows Server Update Services; the cmdlet also gets hotfixes or updates that have been installed manually by users.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get all hotfixes on the local computer
```
PS C:\> Get-HotFix
```

This command gets all hotfixes on the local computer.

### Example 2: Get all hotfixes on multiple computers that start with a search string
```
PS C:\> Get-HotFix -Description "Security*" -ComputerName "Server01", "Server02" -Cred "Server01\admin01"
```

This command gets all hotfixes on the Server01 and Server02 computers that have a description that begins with Security.

### Example 3: Create a text file that contain the computer names that are missing a security update
```
PS C:\> $A = Get-Content "servers.txt"
PS C:\> $A | ForEach { if (!(Get-HotFix -Id "KB957095" -ComputerName $_)) { Add-Content $_ -Path "Missing-kb953631.txt" }}
```

The commands in this example create a text file listing the names of computers that are missing a security update.

The commands use the **Get-Hotfix** cmdlet to get the KB957095 security update on all of the computers whose names are listed in the Servers.txt file.

If a computer does not have the update, the Add-Content cmdlet writes the computer name in the Missing-KB953631.txt file.

### Example 4: Get the most recent hotfix on the local computer
```
PS C:\> (Get-HotFix | sort installedon)[-1]
```

This command gets the most recent hotfix on the computer.

It gets the hotfixes, sorts them by the value of the InstalledOn property, and then it uses array notation to select the last item in the array.
