# Undo-Transaction

## SYNOPSIS
Rolls back the active transaction.

## SYNTAX

```
Undo-Transaction [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Undo-Transaction** cmdlet rolls back the active transaction.
When you roll back a transaction, the changes that were made by the commands in the transaction are discarded and the data is restored to its original form.

If the transaction includes multiple subscribers, an **Undo-Transaction** command rolls back the whole transaction for all subscribers.

By default, transactions are rolled back automatically if any command in the transaction generates an error.
However, transactions can be started by using a different rollback preference and you can use this cmdlet to roll back the active transaction at any time.

The **Undo-Transaction** cmdlet is one of a set of cmdlets that support the transactions feature in Windows PowerShell.
For more information, see about_Transactions.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Roll back the current transaction
```
PS C:\> Undo-Transaction
```

This command rolls back the current, active, transaction.

### Example 2: Start and roll back a transaction
```
PS C:\> cd hkcu:\software
PS HKCU:\Software> Start-Transaction
PS HKCU:\Software> New-Item -Path "ContosoCompany" -UseTransaction
PS HKCU:\Software> Undo-Transaction
```

This example starts a transaction and then rolls it back.
As a result, no changes are made to the registry.

### Example 3: Roll back a transaction for all subscribers
```
PS C:\> cd hkcu:\software
PS HKCU:\Software> Start-Transaction
PS HKCU:\Software> New-Item -Path "ContosoCompany" -UseTransaction
PS HKCU:\Software> Get-Transaction

RollbackPreference   SubscriberCount   Status
------------------   ---------------   -----
Error                1                 Active

PS HKCU:\Software> Start-Transaction
PS HKCU:\Software> Get-Transaction

RollbackPreference   SubscriberCount   Status
------------------   ---------------   -----
Error                2                 Active

PS HKCU:\Software> Undo-Transaction
PS HKCU:\Software> Get-Transaction

RollbackPreference   SubscriberCount   Status
------------------   ---------------   -----
Error                0                 RolledBack
```

This example demonstrates that when any subscriber rolls back a transaction, the whole transaction is rolled back for all subscribers.

The first command changes the location to the HKCU:\Software registry key.

The second command starts a transaction.

The third command uses the New-Item cmdlet to create a new registry key.
The command uses the *UseTransaction* parameter to include the change in the transaction.

The fourth command uses the Get-Transaction cmdlet to get the active transaction.
Notice that the status is Active and the subscriber count is 1.

The fifth command uses the Start-Transaction command again.
Typically, starting a transaction while another transaction is in progress occurs when a script that is used by the main transaction includes its own complete transaction.
This example is performed interactively so that you can examine it in stages.
When you run a **Start-Transaction** command while another transaction is in progress, the commands join the existing transaction as a new subscriber and the subscriber count is incremented.

The sixth command uses the **Get-Transaction** cmdlet to get the active transaction.
Notice that the subscriber count is now 2.

The seventh command uses **Undo-Transaction** to roll back the transaction.
This command does not return any objects.

The final command is a **Get-Transaction** command that gets the active, or in this case, the most recently active, transaction.
The results show that the transaction is rolled back, and that the subscriber count is 0, showing that the transaction was rolled back for all subscribers.
