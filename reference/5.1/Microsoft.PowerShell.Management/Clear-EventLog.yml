  The `Clear-EventLog` cmdlet deletes all of the entries from the specified event logs on the local computer or on remote computers.
  To use `Clear-EventLog`, you must be a member of the Administrators group on the affected computer.

  The cmdlets that contain the **EventLog** noun (the EventLog cmdlets) work only on classic event logs.
  To get events from logs that use the Windows Event Log technology in Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, use the Get-WinEvent cmdlet.
