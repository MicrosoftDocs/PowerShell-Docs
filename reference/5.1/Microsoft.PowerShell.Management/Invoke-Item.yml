parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
    The default is the current user.

    Type a user name, such as "User01" or "Domain01\User01", or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one generated by the `Get-Credential` cmdlet.
    If you type a user name, you are prompted for a password.

    > [!WARNING]
    > This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with Windows PowerShell.

  defaultValue: Current user
  pipelineInput: true

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Exclude
  description: |+
    Specifies, as a string array, an item or items that this cmdlet excludes from the operation.
    The value of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter.
    Enter a path element or pattern, such as "*.txt".
    Wildcard characters are permitted.

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Specifies a filter in the format or language of the provider.
    The value of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter.

    The syntax of the filter, including the use of wildcard characters, depends on the provider.
    Filters are more efficient than other parameters, because the provider applies them when the cmdlet gets the objects rather than having PowerShell filter the objects after they are retrieved.

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Include
  description: |+
    Specifies, as a string array, an item or items that this cmdlet includes in the operation.
    The value of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter.
    Enter a path element or pattern, such as "*.txt".
    Wildcard characters are permitted.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: LiteralPath
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies a path to the item.
    Unlike the **Path** parameter, the value of **LiteralPath** is used exactly as it is typed.
    No characters are interpreted as wildcards.
    If the path includes escape characters, enclose it in single quotation marks.
    Single quotation marks tell PowerShell not to interpret any characters as escape sequences.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
