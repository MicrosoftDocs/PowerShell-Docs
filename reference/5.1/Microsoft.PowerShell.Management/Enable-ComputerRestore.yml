  The **Enable-ComputerRestore** cmdlet turns on the System Restore feature on one or more file system drives.
  As a result, you can use tools, such as the Restore-Computer cmdlet, to restore the computer to a previous state.

  By default, System Restore is enabled on all eligible drives, but you can disable it, such as by using the Disable-ComputerRestore cmdlet.
  To enable (or re-enable) System Restore on any drive, it must be enabled on the system drive, either first or concurrently.
  To find the state of System Restore for each drive, use Rstrui.exe.

  System restore points and the ComputerRestore cmdlets are supported only on client operating systems, such as Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP.
