description: |-
  The `Show-ControlPanelItem` cmdlet opens control panel items on the local computer. You can use it
  to open control panel items by name, category, or description, even on systems that do not have a
  user interface. You can pipe control panel items from the `Get-ControlPanelItem` cmdlet to
  `Show-ControlPanelItem`.

  `Show-ControlPanelItem` searches only control panel items that can be opened on the system. On
  computers that do not have **Control Panel** or **File Explorer**, `Show-ControlPanelItem` searches
  only control panel items that can open without these components.

  This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0 and works on Windows 8, Windows Server 2012,
  and higher versions.
