### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Gets the services on a local or remote computer.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
notes: |-
  You can also refer to **Get-Service** by its built-in alias, "gsv". For more information, see about_Aliases.

  This cmdlet can display services only when the current user has permission to see them.
  If this cmdlet does not display services, you might not have permission to see them.

  To find the service name and display name of each service on your system, type `Get-Service`.
  The service names appear in the Name column, and the display names appear in the DisplayName column.

  When you sort in ascending order by status value, "Stopped" services appear before "Running" services.
  The Status property of a service is an enumerated value in which the names of the statuses represent integer values.
  The sort is based on the integer value, not the name.
  "Running" appears before "Stopped" because "Stopped" has a value of "1", and "Running" has a value of "4".
inputs:
- name: <xref href="System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController, System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

    You can pipe a service object or a service name to this cmdlet.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

    This cmdlet returns objects that represent the services on the computer.

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Get all services on the computer'
  code: |-
    Get-Service
  description: |-
    This command gets all of the services on the computer.
    It behaves as though you typed `Get-Service *`.
    The default display shows the status, service name, and display name of each service.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Get services that begin with a search string'
  code: |-
    Get-Service "wmi*"
  description: |-
    This command retrieves services with service names that begin with WMI (the acronym for Windows Management Instrumentation).
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 3: Display services that include a search string'
  code: |-
    Get-Service -Displayname "*network*"
  description: |-
    This command displays services with a display name that includes the word network.
    Searching the display name finds network-related services even when the service name does not include "Net", such as xmlprov, the Network Provisioning Service.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 4: Get services that begin with a search string and an exclusion'
  code: |-
    Get-Service -Name "win*" -Exclude "WinRM"
  description: |-
    These commands get only the services with service names that begin with win, except for the WinRM service.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 5: Display services that are currently active'
  code: |-
    Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Running"}
  description: |-
    This command displays only the services that are currently active.
    It uses the **Get-Service** cmdlet to get all of the services on the computer.
    The pipeline operator (|) passes the results to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects only the services with a Status property that equals Running.

    Status is only one property of service objects.
    To see all of the properties, type `Get-Service | Get-Member`.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 6: Get the services on a remote computer'
  code: |-
    Get-Service -ComputerName "Server02"
  description: |-
    This command gets the services on the Server02 remote computer.

    Because the *ComputerName* parameter of **Get-Service** does not use Windows PowerShell remoting, you can use this parameter even if the computer is not configured for remoting in Windows PowerShell.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 7: List the services on the local computer that have dependent services'
  code: |-
    Get-Service |
      Where-Object {$_.DependentServices} |
        Format-List -Property Name, DependentServices, @{
          Label="NoOfDependentServices"; Expression={$_.dependentservices.count}
        }

    Name                  : AudioEndpointBuilder
    DependentServices     : {AudioSrv}
    NoOfDependentServices : 1

    Name                  : Dhcp
    DependentServices     : {WinHttpAutoProxySvc}
    NoOfDependentServices : 1
    ...
  description: |-
    The first command uses the **Get-Service** cmdlet to get the services on the computer.
    A pipeline operator (|) sends the services to the **Where-Object** cmdlet, which selects the services whose **DependentServices** property is not null.

    Another pipeline operator sends the results to the Format-List cmdlet.
    The command uses its *Property* parameter to display the name of the service, the name of the dependent services, and a calculated property that displays the number of dependent services that each service has.

- title: 'Example 8: Sort services by property value'
  code: |-
    Get-Service "s*" | Sort-Object status

    Status   Name               DisplayName
    ------   ----               -----------
    Stopped  stisvc             Windows Image Acquisition (WIA)
    Stopped  SwPrv              MS Software Shadow Copy Provider
    Stopped  SysmonLog          Performance Logs and Alerts
    Running  Spooler            Print Spooler
    Running  srservice          System Restore Service
    Running  SSDPSRV            SSDP Discovery Service
    Running  ShellHWDetection   Shell Hardware Detection
    Running  Schedule           Task Scheduler
    Running  SCardSvr           Smart Card
    Running  SamSs              Security Accounts Manager
    Running  SharedAccess       Windows Firewall/Internet Connectio...
    Running  SENS               System Event Notification
    Running  seclogon           Secondary Logon
  description: |-
    This command shows that when you sort services in ascending order by the value of their **Status** property, stopped services appear before running services.
    This happens because the value of Status is an enumeration, in which Stopped has a value of 1, and Running has a value of 4.

    To list running services first, use the *Descending* parameter of the Sort-Object cmdlet.

- title: 'Example 9: Get services on multiple computers'
  code: |-
    Get-Service -Name "WinRM" -ComputerName "localhost", "Server01", "Server02" |
     Format-Table -Property MachineName, Status, Name, DisplayName -auto

    MachineName    Status  Name  DisplayName
    ------------   ------  ----  -----------
    localhost      Running WinRM Windows Remote Management (WS-Management)
    Server01       Running WinRM Windows Remote Management (WS-Management)
    Server02       Running WinRM Windows Remote Management (WS-Management)
  description: |-
    This command uses the **Get-Service** cmdlet to run a Get-Service Winrm command on two remote computers and the local computer ("localhost").

    The command runs on the remote computers, and the results are returned to the local computer.
    A pipeline operator (|) sends the results to the **Format-Table** cmdlet, which formats the services as a table.
    The **Format-Table** command uses the *Property* parameter to specify the properties displayed in the table, including the **MachineName** property.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 10: Get the dependent services of a service'
  code: |-
    Get-Service "WinRM" -RequiredServices
  description: |-
    This command gets the services that the WinRM service requires.

    The command returns the value of the **ServicesDependedOn** property of the service.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 11: Get a service through the pipeline operator'
  code: |-
    "WinRM" | Get-Service
  description: |-
    This command gets the WinRM service on the local computer.
    This example shows that you can pipe a service name string (enclosed in quotation marks) to **Get-Service**.
