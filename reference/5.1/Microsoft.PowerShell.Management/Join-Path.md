# Join-Path

## SYNOPSIS

Combines a path and a child path into a single path.

## SYNTAX

```
Join-Path [-Path] <String[]> [-ChildPath] <String> [-Resolve] [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-UseTransaction]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Join-Path` cmdlet combines a path and child-path into a single path.
The provider supplies the path delimiters.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Combine a path with a child path

```powershell
PS C:\> Join-Path -Path "path" -ChildPath "childpath"
```

```output
path\childpath
```

This command uses `Join-Path` to combine a path with a childpath.

Since the command is executed from the `FileSystem` provider, it provides the `\` delimiter to join the paths.

### Example 2: Combine paths that already contain directory separators

```powershell
PS C:\> Join-Path -Path "path\" -ChildPath "\childpath"
```

```output
path\childpath
```

Existing directory separators `\` and handled so there is only one separator between `Path` and `ChildPath`

### Example 3: Display files and folders by joining a path with a child path

```powershell
Join-Path "C:\win*" "System*" -Resolve
```

This command displays the files and folders that are referenced by joining the C:\Win* path and the System* child path.
It displays the same files and folders as `Get-ChildItem`, but it displays the fully qualified path to each item.
In this command, the `Path` and `ChildPath` optional parameter names are omitted.

### Example 4: Use Join-Path with the Windows PowerShell registry provider

```powershell
PS HKLM:\> Join-Path -Path System -ChildPath *ControlSet* -Resolve
```

```output
HKLM:\System\ControlSet001
HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet
```

This command displays the registry keys in the `HKLM\System` registry subkey that include `ControlSet`.

The `Resolve` parameter, attempts to resolve the joined path, including wildcards from the current provider path `HKLM:\`

### Example 5: Combine multiple path roots with a child path

```powershell
Join-Path -Path C:, D:, E:, F: -ChildPath New
```

```output
C:\New
D:\New
E:\New
F:\New
```

This command uses `Join-Path` to combine multiple path roots with a child path.

> [!NOTE]
> The Drives specified by `Path` must exist or the join of that entry will fail.

### Example 6: Combine the roots of a file system drive with a child path

```powershell
Get-PSDrive -PSProvider filesystem | ForEach-Object {$_.root} | Join-Path -ChildPath "Subdir"
```

```output
C:\Subdir
D:\Subdir
```

This command combines the roots of each Windows PowerShell file system drive in the console with the Subdir child path.

The command uses the `Get-PSDrive` cmdlet to get the Windows PowerShell drives supported by the FileSystem provider.
The `ForEach-Object` statement selects only the Root property of the `PSDriveInfo` objects and combines it with the specified child path.

The output shows that the Windows PowerShell drives on the computer included a drive mapped to the C:\Program Files directory.

## PARAMETERS

### -ChildPath

Specifies the elements to append to the value of the `Path` parameter.
Wildcards are permitted.
The `ChildPath` parameter is required, although the parameter name ("ChildPath") is optional.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential

Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
The default is the current user.

Type a user name, such as User01 or Domain01\User01.
Or, enter a `PSCredential` object, such as one generated by the `Get-Credential` cmdlet.
If you type a user name, you will be prompted for a password.

This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with Windows PowerShell.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Path

Specifies the main path (or paths) to which the child-path is appended.
Wildcards are permitted.

The value of `Path` determines which provider joins the paths and adds the path delimiters.
The `Path` parameter is required, although the parameter name ("Path") is optional.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: PSPath

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Resolve

Indicates that this cmdlet should attempt to resolve the joined path from the current provider.

- If wildcards are used, the cmdlet returns all paths that match the joined path.
- If **no** wildcards are used, the cmdlet will error if the path does not exist.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UseTransaction

Includes the command in the active transaction.
This parameter is valid only when a transaction is in progress.
For more information, see [about_Transactions](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Transactions.md).

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: usetx

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### System.String

You can pipe a string that contains a path to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### System.String

This cmdlet returns a string that contains the resulting path.

## NOTES

The cmdlets that contain the Path noun (the Path cmdlets) manipulate path names and return the names in a concise format that all Windows PowerShell providers can interpret. They are designed for use in programs and scripts where you want to display all or part of a path name in a particular format. Use them like you would use Dirname, Normpath, Realpath, Join, or other path manipulators.

You can use the path cmdlets with several providers, including the `FileSystem`, `Registry`, and `Certificate` providers.

This cmdlet is designed to work with the data exposed by any provider.
To list the providers available in your session, type `Get-PSProvider`.
For more information, see [about_Providers](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Providers.md).
