# Show-ControlPanelItem

## SYNOPSIS
Opens control panel items.

## SYNTAX

### RegularName (Default)
```
Show-ControlPanelItem [-Name] <String[]> [<CommonParameters>]
```

### CanonicalName
```
Show-ControlPanelItem -CanonicalName <String[]> [<CommonParameters>]
```

### ControlPanelItem
```
Show-ControlPanelItem [[-InputObject] <ControlPanelItem[]>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Show-ControlPanelItem** cmdlet opens control panel items on the local computer.
You can use it to open control panel items by name, category, or description, even on systems that do not have a user interface.
You can pipe control panel items from the Get-ControlPanelItem cmdlet to **Show-ControlPanelItem**.

**Show-ControlPanelItem** searches only control panel items that can be opened on the system.
On computers that do not have **Control Panel** or **File Explorer**, **Show-ControlPanelItem** searches only control panel items that can open without these components.

This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.
It works only on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.
Because this cmdlet requires a user interface, it does not work on Server Core installations of Windows Server.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Show a control panel item
```
PS C:\> Show-ControlPanelItem -Name "AutoPlay"
```

This command shows the AutoPlay item.

### Example 2: Pipe a control panel item to this cmdlet
```
PS C:\> Get-ControlPanelItem -Name "Windows Firewall" | Show-ControlPanelItem
```

This command opens the Windows Firewall control panel item on the local computer.
It uses the Get-ControlPanelItem cmdlet to get the control panel item and the **Show-ControlPanelItem** cmdlet to open it.

### Example 3: Use a file name to open a control panel item
```
PS C:\> appwiz
```

This command opens the Programs and Features control panel item by using its application name.
The .cpl file name extension is not required in the command.

This method is an alternative to using a **Show-ControlPanelItem** command.

In Windows PowerShell 3.0, you can omit the .cpl file name extension for control panel item files because it is included in the value of the PathExt environment variable.
