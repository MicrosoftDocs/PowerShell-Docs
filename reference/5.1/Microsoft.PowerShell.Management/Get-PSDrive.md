# Get-PSDrive

## SYNOPSIS
Gets drives in the current session.

## SYNTAX

### Name (Default)
```
Get-PSDrive [[-Name] <String[]>] [-Scope <String>] [-PSProvider <String[]>] [-UseTransaction]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

### LiteralName
```
Get-PSDrive [-LiteralName] <String[]> [-Scope <String>] [-PSProvider <String[]>] [-UseTransaction]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-PSDrive** cmdlet gets the drives in the current session.
You can get a particular drive or all drives in the session.

This cmdlet gets the following types of drives:

- Windows logical drives on the computer, including drives mapped to network shares.
- Drives exposed by Windows PowerShell providers (such as the Certificate:, Function:, and Alias: drives) and the HKLM: and HKCU: drives that are exposed by the Windows PowerShell Registry provider.
- Session-specified temporary drives and persistent mapped network drives that you create by using the New-PSDrive cmdlet.

Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, the *Persist* parameter of the **New-PSDrive** cmdlet can create mapped network drives that are saved on the local computer and are available in other sessions.
For more information, see New-PSDrive.

Also, beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, when an external drive is connected to the computer, Windows PowerShell automatically adds a PSDrive to the file system that represents the new drive.
You do not need to restart Windows PowerShell.
Similarly, when an external drive is disconnected from the computer, Windows PowerShell automatically deletes the PSDrive that represents the removed drive.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get drives in the current session
```
PS C:\> Get-PSDriveName       Provider      Root----       --------      ----Alias      AliasC          FileSystem    C:\cert       Certificate   \D          FileSystem    D:\Env        EnvironmentFunction   FunctionHKCU       Registry      HKEY_CURRENT_USERHKLM       Registry      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINEVariable   VariableX          FileSystem    X:\
```

This command gets the drives in the current session.

The output shows the hard drive (C:) and CD-ROM drive (D:) on the computer, the drives exposed by the Windows PowerShell providers (Alias:, Cert:, Env:, Function:, HKCU:, HKLM:, and Variable:), and a drive mapped to a network share (X:).

### Example 2: Get a drive on the computer
```
PS C:\> Get-PSDrive DName       Provider      Root----       --------      ----D          FileSystem    D:\
```

This command gets the D: drive on the computer.
Note that the drive letter in the command is not followed by a colon.

### Example 3: Get all the drives that are supported by the Windows PowerShell file system provider
```
PS C:\> Get-PSDrive -PSProvider FileSystemName       Provider      Root----       --------      ----C          FileSystem    C:\D          FileSystem    D:\X          FileSystem    X:\Y          FileSystem    \\Server01\PublicZ          FileSystem    C:\Windows\System32
```

This command gets all of the drives that are supported by the Windows PowerShell FileSystem provider.
This includes fixed drives, logical partitions, mapped network drives, and temporary drives that you create by using the New-PSDrive cmdlet.

### Example 4: Check to see if a drive is in use as a Windows PowerShell drive name
```
PS C:\> if (!(Get-PSDrive X)) {New-PSDrive -Name X -PSProvider Registry -Root HKLM:\Network}else { Write-Host "The X: drive is already in use." }
```

This command checks to see whether the X drive is already in use as a Windows PowerShell drive name.
If it is not, the command uses the New-PSDrive cmdlet to create a temporary drive that is mapped to the HKLM:\Network registry key.

### Example 5: Compare the types of files system drives
```

```

This example compares the types of file system drives that are displayed by **Get-PSDrive** to those displayed by using other methods.
This example demonstrates different ways to display drives in Windows PowerShell, and it shows that temporary, session-specific drives created by using the New-PSDrive cmdlet are accessible only in Windows PowerShell.

The first command uses **Get-PSDrive** to get all of the file system drives in the session.
This includes the fixed drives (C: and D:), a mapped network drive (X:) that was created by using the *Persist* parameter of **New-PSDrive**, and two temporary Windows PowerShell drives (Y: and Z:) that were created by using **New-PSDrive** without the *Persist* parameter.

A net use command, which displays Windows mapped network drives, displays only the X drive.
It does not display the Y: and Z: drives that were created by **New-PSDrive**.
It shows that the X: drive is also mapped to \\\\Server01\Public.

The third command uses the **GetDrives** method of the Microsoft .NET Framework **System.IO.DriveInfo** class.
This command gets the Windows file system drives, including drive X:, but it does not get the temporary drives created by **New-PSDrive**.

The fourth command uses the Get-WmiObject cmdlet to get the instances of the **Win32_LogicalDisk** class.
It returns the C:, D:, and X: drives, but not the temporary drives created by **New-PSDrive**.

The last command uses the Get-WmiObject cmdlet to display the instances of the **Win32_NetworkConnection** class.
Like net use, it returns only the persistent X: drive that was created by **New-PSDrive**.

## PARAMETERS

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### None
You cannot pipe objects to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### System.Management.Automation.PSDriveInfo
This cmdlet returns objects that represent the drives in the session.

## NOTES
* This cmdlet is designed to work with the data exposed by any provider. To list the providers available in your session, use the Get-PSProvider cmdlet. For more information, see about_Providers (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113250).
* Mapped network drives that are created by using the *Persist* parameter of the New-PSDrive cmdlet are specific to a user account. Mapped network drives that you create in sessions that are started with the Run as administrator option or with the credentials of another user are not visible in sessions that are started without explicit credentials or with the credentials of the current user.
