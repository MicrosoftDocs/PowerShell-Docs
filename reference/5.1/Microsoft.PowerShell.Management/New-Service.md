# New-Service

## SYNOPSIS
Creates a new Windows service.

## SYNTAX

```
New-Service [-Name] <String> [-BinaryPathName] <String> [-DisplayName <String>] [-Description <String>]
 [-StartupType <ServiceStartMode>] [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-DependsOn <String[]>] [-WhatIf]
 [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `New-Service` cmdlet creates a new entry for a Windows service in the registry and in the
service database. A new service requires an executable file that runs during the service.

The parameters of this cmdlet let you set the display name, description, startup type, and
dependencies of the service.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Create a service

```powershell
New-Service -Name "TestService" -BinaryPathName '"C:\WINDOWS\System32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs"'
```

This command creates a service named TestService.

### Example 2: Create a service that includes description, startup type, and display name

```powershell
$params = @{
  Name = "TestService"
  BinaryPathName = '"C:\WINDOWS\System32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs"'
  DependsOn = "NetLogon"
  DisplayName = "Test Service"
  StartupType = "Manual"
  Description = "This is a test service."
}
New-Service @params
```

This command creates a service named TestService. It uses the parameters of `New-Service` to specify
a description, startup type, and display name for the new service.

### Example 3: View the new service

```powershell
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Service -Filter "Name='testservice'"
```

```Output
ExitCode  : 0
Name      : testservice
ProcessId : 0
StartMode : Auto
State     : Stopped
Status    : OK
```

This command uses `Get-CimInstance` to get the **Win32_Service** object for the new service. This
object includes the start mode and the service description.

### Example 4: Delete a service

```powershell
sc.exe delete TestService
# - or -
(Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Service -Filter "name='TestService'").delete()
```

This example shows two ways to delete the TestService service. The first command uses the delete
option of `Sc.exe`. The second command uses the **Delete** method of the **Win32_Service** objects
that `Get-CimInstance` returns.

## PARAMETERS

### -BinaryPathName

Specifies the path of the executable file for the service. This parameter is required.

The fully qualified path to the service binary file. If the path contains a space, it must be quoted
so that it is correctly interpreted. For example, `d:\my share\myservice.exe` should be specified as
`'"d:\my share\myservice.exe"'`.

The path can also include arguments for an auto-start service. For example,
`'"d:\myshare\myservice.exe arg1 arg2"'`. These arguments are passed to the service entry point.

For more information, see the **lpBinaryPathName** parameter of
[CreateServiceW](/windows/win32/api/winsvc/nf-winsvc-createservicew) API.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential

Specifies the account used by the service as the
[Service Logon Account](/windows/desktop/ad/about-service-logon-accounts).

Type a user name, such as **User01** or **Domain01\User01**, or enter a **PSCredential** object,
such as one generated by the `Get-Credential` cmdlet. If you type a user name, this cmdlet prompts
you for a password.

Credentials are stored in a [PSCredential](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential)
object and the password is stored as a [SecureString](/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring).

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about **SecureString** data protection, see
> [How secure is SecureString?](/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring#how-secure-is-securestring).

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DependsOn

Specifies the names of other services upon which the new service depends. To enter multiple service
names, use a comma to separate the names.

```yaml
Type: System.String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Description

Specifies a description of the service.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisplayName

Specifies a display name for the service.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name

Specifies the name of the service. This parameter is required.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: ServiceName

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -StartupType

Sets the startup type of the service. The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- **Automatic** - The service is started or was started by the operating system, at system start-up.
  If an automatically started service depends on a manually started service, the manually started
  service is also started automatically at system startup.
- **Disabled** - The service is disabled and cannot be started by a user or application.
- **Manual** - The service is started only manually, by a user, using the Service Control Manager,
  or by an application.
- **Boot** - Indicates that the service is a device driver started by the system loader. This
  value is valid only for device drivers.
- **System** - Indicates that the service is a device driver started by the 'IOInitSystem()'
  function. This value is valid only for device drivers.

 The default value is **Automatic**.

```yaml
Type: System.ServiceProcess.ServiceStartMode
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: Boot, System, Automatic, Manual, Disabled

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Automatic
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml

### -WhatIf

Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs. The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable,
-InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose,
-WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see
[about_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### None

You cannot pipe input to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController

This cmdlet returns an object that represents the new service.

## NOTES

To run this cmdlet, start PowerShell by using the **Run as administrator** option.

To delete a service, use Sc.exe, or use the `Get-CimInstance` cmdlet to get the **Win32_Service**
object that represents the service and then use the **Delete** method to delete the service. The
object that `Get-Service` returns does not have a delete method.
