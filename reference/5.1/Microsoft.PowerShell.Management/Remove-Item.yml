### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Deletes the specified items.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
notes: |-
  Windows PowerShell includes the following aliases for `Remove-Item`:

  - `del`
  - `erase`
  - `rd`
  - `ri`
  - `rm`
  - `rmdir`

  The `Remove-Item` cmdlet is designed to work with the data exposed by any provider. To list the
  providers available in your session, type `Get-PsProvider`. For more information, see
  [about_Providers](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Providers.md).

  When you try to delete a folder that contains items without using the **Recurse** parameter, the
  cmdlet prompts for confirmation. Using `-Confirm:$false` doesn't suppress the prompt. This is by
  design.
inputs:
- name: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    You can pipe a string that contains a path, but not a literal path, to this cmdlet.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="None" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    This cmdlet returns no output.

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Delete files that have any file extension'
  code: |-
    Remove-Item C:\Test\*.*
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example deletes all files with names that include a dot (`.`) from the `C:\Test` folder.
    Because the command specifies a dot, the command doesn't delete folders or files that have no
    file extension.

- title: 'Example 2: Delete document files in a folder'
  code: |-
    Remove-Item * -Include *.doc -Exclude *1*
  description: |-
    It uses the wildcard character (`*`) to specify the contents of the current folder. It uses the
    **Include** and **Exclude** parameters to specify the files to delete.
  summary: |+
    This example deletes from the current folder all files that have a `.doc` file extension and a
    name that doesn't include `*1*`.

- title: 'Example 3: Delete hidden, read-only files'
  code: |-
    Remove-Item -Path C:\Test\hidden-RO-file.txt -Force
  description: |-
    It uses the **Path** parameter to specify the file. It uses the **Force**
    parameter to delete it. Without **Force**, you can't delete _read-only_ or
    _hidden_ files.
  summary: |+
    This command deletes a file that's both _hidden_ and _read-only_.

- title: 'Example 4: Delete files in subfolders recursively'
  code: |-
    Get-ChildItem * -Include *.csv -Recurse | Remove-Item
  description: |-
    In the `Get-ChildItem` command, **Path** has a value of (`*`), which represents the contents of the
    current folder. It uses **Include** to specify the CSV file type, and it uses **Recurse** to make
    the retrieval recursive. If you try to specify the file type in the path, such as `-Path *.csv`, the
    cmdlet interprets the subject of the search to be a file that has no child items, and **Recurse**
    fails.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This behavior was fixed in Windows versions 1909 and up.
  summary: |+
    This command deletes all the CSV files in the current folder and all subfolders recursively.

    Because the **Recurse** parameter in `Remove-Item` has a known issue, the command in this example
    uses `Get-ChildItem` to get the desired files, and then uses the pipeline operator to pass them to
    `Remove-Item`.

- title: 'Example 5: Delete subkeys recursively'
  code: |-
    Remove-Item HKLM:\Software\MyCompany\OldApp -Recurse
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This command deletes the "OldApp" registry key and all its subkeys and values. It uses `Remove-Item`
    to remove the key. The path is specified, but the optional parameter name (**Path**) is omitted.

    The **Recurse** parameter deletes all of the contents of the "OldApp" key recursively. If the key
    contains subkeys and you omit the **Recurse** parameter, you are prompted to confirm that you want
    to delete the contents of the key.

- title: 'Example 6: Deleting files with special characters'
  code: |-

    The following example shows how to delete files that contain special characters like brackets or
    parentheses.

- title: 'Example 7: Remove an alternate data stream'
  code: |-
    Get-Item C:\Test\Copy-Script.ps1 -Stream Zone.Identifier

        + FullyQualifiedErrorId : AlternateDataStreamNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetItemCommand
  description: |-
    The **Stream** parameter `Get-Item` gets the `Zone.Identifier` stream of the `Copy-Script.ps1`
    file. `Remove-Item` uses the **Stream** parameter to remove the `Zone.Identifier` stream of the
    file. Finally, the `Get-Item` cmdlet shows that the `Zone.Identifier` stream was deleted.
  summary: |+
    This example shows how to use the **Stream** dynamic parameter of the `Remove-Item` cmdlet to delete
    an alternate data stream. The stream parameter is introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  name: DeleteKey
  description: |+
    This is a dynamic parameter made available by the **Certificate** provider. The **Certificate**
    provider and this parameter are only available on Windows platforms.

    When provided, the cmdlet deletes the private key when the certificate is deleted.

    For more information, see
    [about_Certificate_Provider](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Security/About/about_Certificate_Provider.md).

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Exclude
  description: |+
    Specifies, as a string array, an item or items that this cmdlet excludes in the operation. The value
    of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter. Enter a path element or pattern, such as
    `*.txt`. Wildcard characters are permitted. The **Exclude** parameter is effective only when the
    command includes the contents of an item, such as `C:\Windows\*`, where the wildcard character
    specifies the contents of the `C:\Windows` directory.

    When using **Recurse** with **Exclude**, **Exclude** only filters results of the current directory.
    If there are files that match the **Exclude** pattern in subfolders, those files are removed along
    with its parent directory.

  defaultValue: None

  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Specifies a filter to qualify the **Path** parameter. The
    [FileSystem](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_FileSystem_Provider.md) provider is the only
    installed PowerShell provider that supports the use of filters. You can find the syntax for the
    **FileSystem** filter language in
    [about_Wildcards](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Wildcards.md). Filters are more efficient
    than other parameters, because the provider applies them when the cmdlet gets the objects rather
    than having PowerShell filter the objects after they're retrieved.

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Forces the cmdlet to remove items that can't otherwise be changed, such as hidden or read-only
    files or read-only aliases or variables. The cmdlet can't remove constant aliases or variables.
    Implementation varies from provider to provider. For more information, see
    [about_Providers](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Providers.md). Even using the **Force**
    parameter, the cmdlet can't override security restrictions.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Include
  description: |+
    Specifies, as a string array, an item or items that this cmdlet includes in the operation. The value
    of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter. Enter a path element or pattern, such as
    `"*.txt"`. Wildcard characters are permitted. The **Include** parameter is effective only when the
    command includes the contents of an item, such as `C:\Windows\*`, where the wildcard character
    specifies the contents of the `C:\Windows` directory.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: LiteralPath
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies a path to one or more locations. The value of **LiteralPath** is used exactly as it's
    typed. No characters are interpreted as wildcards. If the path includes escape characters, enclose
    it in single quotation marks. Single quotation marks tell PowerShell not to interpret any characters
    as escape sequences.

  name: Recurse
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet deletes the items in the specified locations and in all child items of
    the locations.

    The **Recurse** parameter might not delete all subfolders or all child items. This is a known issue.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This behavior was fixed in Windows versions 1909 and newer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Stream
  description: |+
    This is a dyanamic parameter made available by the **FileSystem** provider. This parameter is only
    available on Windows. This parameter can't be used in combination with the **Recurse** parameter.

    You can use `Remove-Item` to delete an alternative data stream, such as `Zone.Identifier`.
    However, it isn't the recommended way to eliminate security checks that block files that are
    downloaded from the Internet. If you verify that a downloaded file is safe, use the `Unblock-File`
    cmdlet.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

    For more information, see
    [about_FileSystem_Provider](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_FileSystem_Provider.md).
