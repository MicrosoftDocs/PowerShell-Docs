# Pop-Location

## SYNOPSIS
Changes the current location to the location most recently pushed onto the stack.

## SYNTAX

```
Pop-Location [-PassThru] [-StackName <String>] [-UseTransaction] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Pop-Location** cmdlet changes the current location to the location most recently pushed onto the stack by using the Push-Location cmdlet.
You can pop a location from the default stack or from a stack that you create by using a **Push-Location** command.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Change to most recent location
```
PS C:\> Pop-Location
```

This command changes your location to the location most recently added to the current stack.

### Example 2: Change to most recent location in a named stack
```
PS C:\> Pop-Location -StackName "Stack2"
```

This command changes your location to the location most recently added to the Stack2 location stack.

For more information about location stacks, see the Notes.

### Example 3: Move between locations for different providers
```
PS C:\> pushd HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\PowerShell
PS HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\PowerShell> pushd Cert:\LocalMachine\TrustedPublisher
PS cert:\LocalMachine\TrustedPublisher> popd
PS HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\PowerShell> popd
PS C:\>
```

These commands use the **Push-Location** and **Pop-Location** cmdlets to move between locations supported by different Windows PowerShell providers.
The commands use the **pushd** alias for **Push-Location** and the **popd** alias for **Pop-Location**.

The first command pushes the current file system location onto the stack and moves to the HKLM drive supported by the Windows PowerShell Registry provider.

The second command pushes the registry location onto the stack and moves to a location supported by the Windows PowerShell certificate provider.

The last two commands pop those locations off the stack.
The first **popd** command returns to the Registry drive, and the second command returns to the file system drive.

## PARAMETERS

### -PassThru
Passes an object that represents the location to the pipeline.
By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -StackName
Specifies the location stack from which the location is popped.
Enter a location stack name.

Without this parameter, **Pop-Location** pops a location from the current location stack.
By default, the current location stack is the unnamed default location stack that Windows PowerShell creates.
To make a location stack the current location stack, use the *StackName* parameter of **Set-Location**.

**Pop-Location** cannot pop a location from the unnamed default stack unless it is the current location stack.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UseTransaction
Includes the command in the active transaction.
This parameter is valid only when a transaction is in progress.
For more information, see about_Transactions.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: usetx

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### None
You cannot pipe input to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### None, System.Management.Automation.PathInfo
This cmdlet generates a **System.Management.Automation.PathInfo** object that represents the location, if you specify the *PassThru* parameter.
Otherwise, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

## NOTES
* A stack is a last-in, first-out list in which only the most recently added item can be accessed. You add items to a stack in the order that you use them, and then retrieve them for use in the reverse order. Windows PowerShell lets you store provider locations in location stacks.
* Windows PowerShell lets you store provider locations in location stacks. Windows PowerShell creates an unnamed default location stack and you can create multiple named location stacks. If you do not specify a stack name, Windows PowerShell uses the current location stack. By default, the unnamed default location is the current location stack, but you can use the Set-Location cmdlet to change the current location stack.
* To manage location stacks, use the Windows PowerShell**Location** cmdlets, as follows:

- To add a location to a location stack, use the **Push-Location** cmdlet.
- To get a location from a location stack, use the **Pop-Location** cmdlet.
- To display the locations in the current location stack, use the *Stack* parameter of the **Get-Location** cmdlet.
- To display the locations in a named location stack, use the *StackName* parameter of the **Get-Location** cmdlet.
- To create a new location stack, use the *StackName* parameter of the **Push-Location** cmdlet. If you specify a stack that does not exist, **Push-Location** creates the stack.
- To make a location stack the current location stack, use the *StackName* parameter of the **Set-Location** cmdlet.
* The unnamed default location stack is fully available only when it is the current location stack. If you make a named location stack the current location stack, you can no longer use **Push-Location** or **Pop-Location** cmdlets add or get items from the default stack or use a **Get-Location** command to display the locations in the unnamed stack. To make the unnamed stack the current stack, use the *StackName* parameter of **Set-Location** with a value of $Null or an empty string ("").
* You can also refer to **Pop-Location** by its built-in alias, **popd**. For more information, see about_Aliases.
* **Pop-Location** is designed to work with the data exposed by any provider. To list the providers available in your session, type `Get-PSProvider`. For more information, see about_Providers.
