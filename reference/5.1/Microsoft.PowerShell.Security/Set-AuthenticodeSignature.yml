examples:
- title: Example 1 - Sign a script using a certificate from the local certificate store
  code: |-
    $cert=Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:\CurrentUser\My -CodeSigningCert
    Set-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath PsTestInternet2.ps1 -Certificate $cert
  description: |-
    The first command uses the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet and the PowerShell certificate provider to get the
    certificates in the `Cert:\CurrentUser\My` subdirectory of the certificate store. The `Cert:` drive
    is the drive exposed by the certificate provider. The **CodeSigningCert** parameter, which is
    supported only by the certificate provider, limits the certificates retrieved to those with
    code-signing authority. The command stores the result in the `$cert` variable.

    The second command uses the `Set-AuthenticodeSignature` cmdlet to sign the `PSTestInternet2.ps1`
    script. It uses the **FilePath** parameter to specify the name of the script and the **Certificate**
    parameter to specify that the certificate is stored in the `$cert` variable.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Using the **CodeSigningCert** parameter with `Get-ChildItem` only returns certificates that have
    > code-signing authority and contain a private key. If there is no private key, the certificates
    > cannot be used for signing.
  summary: |+
    These commands retrieve a code-signing certificate from the PowerShell certificate provider and use
    it to sign a PowerShell script.

- title: Example 2 - Sign a script using a certificate from a PFX file
  code: |-
    $cert = Get-PfxCertificate -FilePath C:\Test\Mysign.pfx
    Set-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath ServerProps.ps1 -Certificate $cert
  description: |-
    The first command uses the `Get-PfxCertificate` cmdlet to load the C:\Test\MySign.pfx certificate
    into the `$cert` variable.

    The second command uses `Set-AuthenticodeSignature` to sign the script. The **FilePath** parameter
    of `Set-AuthenticodeSignature` specifies the path to the script file being signed and the **Cert**
    parameter passes the `$cert` variable containing the certificate to `Set-AuthenticodeSignature`.

    If the certificate file is password protected, PowerShell prompts you for the password.
  summary: |+
    These commands use the `Get-PfxCertificate` cmdlet to load a code signing certificate. Then, use it
    to sign a PowerShell script.

- title: Example 3 - Add a signature that includes the root authority
  code: |-
    Set-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath c:\scripts\Remodel.ps1 -Certificate $cert -IncludeChain All -TimestampServer "http://timestamp.fabrikam.com/scripts/timstamper.dll"
  description: |-
    The command uses the **FilePath** parameter to specify the script being signed and the
    **Certificate** parameter to specify the certificate that is saved in the `$cert` variable. It uses
    the **IncludeChain** parameter to include all of the signatures in the trust chain, including the
    root authority. It also uses the **TimeStampServer** parameter to add a timestamp to the signature.
    This prevents the script from failing when the certificate expires.
  summary: |+
    This command adds a digital signature that includes the root authority in the trust chain, and it is
    signed by a third-party timestamp server.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Certificate
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the certificate that will be used to sign the script or file. Enter a variable that stores
    an object representing the certificate or an expression that gets the certificate.

    To find a certificate, use `Get-PfxCertificate` or use the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet in the Certificate
    `Cert:` drive. If the certificate is not valid or does not have `code-signing` authority, the
    command fails.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Byte" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Content
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Contents of a file as a byte array for which the digital signature is added. This parameter must be
    used with **SourcePathOrExtension** parameter. The contents of the file must be in Unicode
    (UTF-16LE) format.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: FilePath
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the path to a file that is being signed.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Allows the cmdlet to append a signature to a read-only file. Even using the **Force** parameter, the
    cmdlet cannot override security restrictions.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: HashAlgorithm
  description: |+
    Specifies the hashing algorithm that Windows uses to compute the digital signature for the file.

    For PowerShell 3.0, the default is SHA256, which is the Windows default hashing algorithm. For
    PowerShell 2.0, the default is SHA1. Files that are signed with a different hashing algorithm might
    not be recognized on other systems. Which algorithms are supported depends on the version of the
    operating system.

    For a list of possible values, see [HashAlgorithmName Struct](/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.hashalgorithmname?view=netframework-4.7.2#properties).

  defaultValue: SHA256
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IncludeChain
  description: |+
    Determines which certificates in the certificate trust chain are included in the digital signature.
    **NotRoot** is the default.

    Valid values are:

    - Signer: Includes only the signer's certificate.
    - NotRoot: Includes all of the certificates in the certificate chain, except for the root authority.
    - All: Includes all the certificates in the certificate chain.

  defaultValue: NotRoot
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: LiteralPath
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the path to a file that is being signed. Unlike **FilePath**, the value of the
    **LiteralPath** parameter is used exactly as it is typed. No characters are interpreted as
    wildcards. If the path includes escape characters, enclose it in single quotation marks. Single
    quotation marks tell PowerShell not to interpret any characters as escape sequences.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: PSPath
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: SourcePathOrExtension
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Path to the file or file type of the content for which the digital signature is added. This
    parameter is used with **Content** where file content is passed as a byte array.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: TimestampServer
  description: |+
    Uses the specified time stamp server to add a time stamp to the signature. Type the URL of the time
    stamp server as a string.

    The time stamp represents the exact time that the certificate was added to the file. A time stamp
    prevents the script from failing if the certificate expires because users and programs can verify
    that the certificate was valid at the time of signing.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs. The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: Microsoft.PowerShell.Security.Set-AuthenticodeSignature
name: Set-AuthenticodeSignature
description: |-
  The `Set-AuthenticodeSignature` cmdlet adds an Authenticode signature to any file that supports
  Subject Interface Package (SIP).

  In a PowerShell script file, the signature takes the form of a block of text that indicates the end
  of the instructions that are executed in the script. If there is a signature in the file when this
  cmdlet runs, that signature is removed.
