### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Gets the PowerShell sessions on local and remote computers.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core
notes: |-
  - This cmdlet gets user-managed sessions **PSSession** objects" such as those that are created by
    using the New-PSSession, `Enter-PSSession`, and Invoke-Command cmdlets. It does not get the
    system-managed session that is created when you start PowerShell.
  - Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, **PSSession** objects are stored on the computer that is at
    the server-side or receiving end of a connection. To get the sessions that are stored on the local
    computer or a remote computer, PowerShell establishes a temporary session to the specified
    computer and runs query commands in the session.
  - To get sessions that connect to a remote computer, use the **ComputerName** or **ConnectionUri**
    parameters to specify the remote computer. To filter the sessions that `Get-PSSession` gets, use
    the **Name**, **ID**, **InstanceID**, and **State** parameters. Use the remaining parameters to
    configure the temporary session that `Get-PSSession` uses.
  - When you use the **ComputerName** or **ConnectionUri** parameters, `Get-PSSession` gets only
    sessions from computers running Windows PowerShell 3.0 and later versions of PowerShell.
  - The value of the **State** property of a **PSSession** is relative to the current session.
    Therefore, a value of **Disconnected** means that the **PSSession** is not connected to the
    current session. However, it does not mean that the **PSSession** is disconnected from all
    sessions. It might be connected to a different session. To determine whether you can connect or
    reconnect to the **PSSession** from the current session, use the **Availability** property.

  An **Availability** value of **None** indicates that you can connect to the session. A value of
  **Busy** indicates that you cannot connect to the **PSSession** because it is connected to another
  session.

  For more information about the values of the **State** property of sessions, see
  [RunspaceState Enumeration](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.runspaces.runspacestate).

  For more information about the values of the **Availability** property of sessions, see
  [RunspaceAvailability Enumeration](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.runspaces.runspaceavailability).

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Get sessions created in the current session'
  code: |-
    Get-PSSession
  description: |-
    This command gets all of the **PSSessions** that were created in the current session. It does not
    get **PSSessions** that were created in other sessions or on other computers, even if they connect
    to this computer.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Get sessions connected to the local computer'
  code: |-
    Get-PSSession -ComputerName "localhost"
  description: |-
    This command gets the **PSSessions** that are connected to the local computer. To indicate the local
    computer, type the computer name, localhost, or a dot (.)

    The command returns all of the sessions on the local computer, even if they were created in
    different sessions or on different computers.

    This command gets the **PSSessions** that are connected to the Server02 computer.

    The command returns all of the sessions on Server02, even if they were created in different sessions
    or on different computers.

    The output shows that two of the sessions have a Disconnected state and a Busy availability. They
    were created in different sessions and are currently in use. The ScheduledJobs session, which is
    Opened and Available, was created in the current session.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 4: Save results of this command'
  code: |-
    New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01, Server02, Server03
    $s1, $s2, $s3 = Get-PSSession
  description: |-
    This example shows how to save the results of a `Get-PSSession` command in multiple variables.

    The first command uses the `New-PSSession` cmdlet to create **PSSessions** on three remote
    computers.

    The second command uses a `Get-PSSession` cmdlet to get the three **PSSessions**. It then saves each
    of the **PSSessions** in a separate variable.

    When PowerShell assigns an array of objects to an array of variables, it assigns the first object to
    the first variable, the second object to the second variable, and so on. If there are more objects
    than variables, it assigns all remaining objects to the last variable in the array. If there are
    more variables than objects, the extra variables are not used.

    Remove-PSSession -Session $s
  description: |-
    This example shows how to get a **PSSession** by using its instance ID, and then to delete the
    **PSSession**.

    The first command gets all of the **PSSessions** that were created in the current session. It sends
    the **PSSessions** to the Format-Table cmdlet, which displays the **ComputerName** and
    **InstanceID** properties of each **PSSession**.

    The second command uses the `Get-PSSession` cmdlet to get a particular **PSSession** and to save it
    in the `$s` variable. The command uses the **InstanceID** parameter to identify the **PSSession**.

    The third command uses the Remove-PSSession cmdlet to delete the **PSSession** in the `$s` variable.

  description: |-
    The first command gets sessions on the Server02 and Server12 remote computers that have names that
    begin with BackupJob and use the ITTasks session configuration.The command uses the **Name**
    parameter to specify the name pattern and the **ConfigurationName** parameter to specify the session
    configuration. The value of the **SessionOption** parameter is a hash table that sets the value of
    the **OperationTimeout** to 240000 milliseconds (4 minutes). This setting gives the command more
    time to complete.The **ConfigurationName** and **SessionOption** parameters are used to configure
    the temporary sessions in which the `Get-PSSession` cmdlet runs on each computer.The output shows
    that the command returns the BackupJob04 session. The session is disconnected and the
    **Availability** is None, which indicates that it is not in use.

    The second command uses the `Get-PSSession` cmdlet to get to the BackupJob04 session and the
    Connect-PSSession cmdlet to connect to the session. The command saves the session in the $s
    variable.

    The third command gets the session in the $s variable. The output shows that the `Connect-PSSession`
    command was successful. The session is in the **Opened** state and is available for use.
  summary: |+
    The commands in this example find a session that has a particular name format and uses a particular
    session configuration and then connect to the session. You can use a command like this one to find a
    session in which a colleague started a task and connect to finish the task.

- title: 'Example 7: Get a session by using its ID'
  code: |-
    Get-PSSession -Id 2
  description: |-
    This command gets the **PSSession** with ID 2. Because the value of the **ID** property is unique
    only in the current session, the **Id** parameter is valid only for local commands.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: AllowRedirection
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet allows redirection of this connection to an alternate Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI). By default, PowerShell does not redirect connections.

    This parameter configures the temporary connection that is created to run a `Get-PSSession` command
    with the **ConnectionUri** parameter.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ApplicationName
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of an application. This cmdlet connects only to sessions that use the specified
    application.

    Enter the application name segment of the connection URI. For example, in the following connection
    URI, the application name is WSMan: `http://localhost:5985/WSMAN`. The application name of a session
    is stored in the **Runspace.ConnectionInfo.AppName** property of the session.

    The value of this parameter is used to select and filter sessions. It does not change the
    application that the session uses.

  defaultValue: All sessions
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.AuthenticationMechanism" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Authentication
  description: |+
    Specifies the mechanism that is used to authenticate credentials for the session in which the
    `Get-PSSession` command runs.

    This parameter configures the temporary connection that is created to run a `Get-PSSession` command
    with the **ComputerName** or **ConnectionUri** parameter.

    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - Default
    - Basic
    - Credssp
    - Digest
    - Kerberos
    - Negotiate
    - NegotiateWithImplicitCredential.

    The default value is Default.

    For more information about the values of this parameter, see
    [AuthenticationMechanism Enumeration](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.runspaces.authenticationmechanism).

    CAUTION: Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) authentication, in which the user's
    credentials are passed to a remote computer to be authenticated, is designed for commands that
    require authentication on more than one resource, such as accessing a remote network share. This
    mechanism increases the security risk of the remote operation. If the remote computer is
    compromised, the credentials that are passed to it can be used to control the network session.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  defaultValue: Default
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Default, Basic, Negotiate, NegotiateWithImplicitCredential, Credssp, Digest, Kerberos
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: CertificateThumbprint
  description: |+
    Specifies the digital public key certificate (X509) of a user account that has permission to create
    the session in which the `Get-PSSession` command runs. Enter the certificate thumbprint of the
    certificate.

    This parameter configures the temporary connection that is created to run a `Get-PSSession` command
    with the **ComputerName** or **ConnectionUri** parameter.

    Certificates are used in client certificate-based authentication. They can be mapped only to local
    user accounts; they do not work with domain accounts.

    To get a certificate thumbprint, use a Get-Item or Get-ChildItem command in the PowerShell Cert:
    drive.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ComputerName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of names of computers. Gets the sessions that connect to the specified computers.
    Wildcard characters are not permitted. There is no default value.

    Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, **PSSession** objects are stored on the computers at the remote
    end of each connection. To get the sessions on the specified computers, PowerShell creates a
    temporary connection to each computer and runs a `Get-PSSession` command.

    Type the NetBIOS name, an IP address, or a fully-qualified domain name of one or more computers. To
    specify the local computer, type the computer name, localhost, or a dot (.).

    Note: This parameter gets sessions only from computers that run Windows PowerShell 3.0 or later
    versions of PowerShell. Earlier versions do not store sessions.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: Cn
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ConfigurationName
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of a configuration. This cmdlet gets only to sessions that use the specified
    session configuration.

    Enter a configuration name or the fully qualified resource URI for a session configuration. If you
    specify only the configuration name, the following schema URI is prepended:
    `http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell`. The configuration name of a session is stored in the
    **ConfigurationName** property of the session.

    The value of this parameter is used to select and filter sessions. It does not change the session
    configuration that the session uses.

    For more information about session configurations, see
    [about_Session_Configurations](About/about_Session_Configurations.md).

  defaultValue: All sessions

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Uri" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ConnectionUri
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies a URI that defines the connection endpoint for the temporary session in which the
    `Get-PSSession` command runs. The URI must be fully qualified.

    This parameter configures the temporary connection that is created to run a `Get-PSSession` command
    with the **ConnectionUri** parameter.

    The format of this string is:

    `<Transport>://<ComputerName>:<Port\>/<ApplicationName>`

    The default value is: `http://localhost:5985/WSMAN`.

    If you do not specify a **ConnectionUri**, you can use the **UseSSL**, **ComputerName**, **Port**,
    and **ApplicationName** parameters to specify the **ConnectionURI** values. Valid values for the
    Transport segment of the URI are HTTP and HTTPS. If you specify a connection URI with a Transport
    segment, but do not specify a port, the session is created with standards ports: 80 for HTTP and 443
    for HTTPS. To use the default ports for PowerShell remoting, specify port 5985 for HTTP or 5986 for
    HTTPS.

    If the destination computer redirects the connection to a different URI, PowerShell prevents the
    redirection unless you use the **AllowRedirection** parameter in the command.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

    This parameter gets sessions only from computers that run Windows PowerShell 3.0 or later versions
    of Windows PowerShell. Earlier versions do not store sessions.

  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies a user credential. This cmdlet runs the command with the permissions of the specified
    user. Specify a user account that has permission to connect to the remote computer and run a
    `Get-PSSession` command. The default is the current user.

    Type a user name, such as **User01** or **Domain01\User01**, or enter a **PSCredential** object
    generated by the `Get-Credential` cmdlet. If you type a user name, you're prompted to enter the
    password.

    Credentials are stored in a [PSCredential](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential)
    object and the password is stored as a [SecureString](/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring).

    > [!NOTE]
    > For more information about **SecureString** data protection, see
    > [How secure is SecureString?](/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring#how-secure-is-securestring).

    This parameter configures to the temporary connection that is created to run a `Get-PSSession`
    command with the **ComputerName** or **ConnectionUri** parameter.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  name: Id
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of session IDs. This cmdlet gets only the sessions with the specified IDs. Type
    one or more IDs, separated by commas, or use the range operator (..) to specify a range of IDs. You
    cannot use the ID parameter together with the **ComputerName** parameter.

    An ID is an integer that uniquely identifies the user-managed sessions in the current session. It is
    easier to remember and type than the **InstanceId**, but it is unique only within the current
    session. The ID of a session is stored in the ID property of the session.

  name: InstanceId
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of instance IDs of sessions. This cmdlet gets only the sessions with the
    specified instance IDs.

    The instance ID is a GUID that uniquely identifies a session on a local or remote computer. The
    **InstanceID** is unique, even when you have multiple sessions running in PowerShell.

    The instance ID of a session is stored in the **InstanceID** property of the session.

  name: Port
  description: |+
    Specifies the specified network port that is used for the temporary connection in which the
    `Get-PSSession` command runs. To connect to a remote computer, the remote computer must be listening
    on the port that the connection uses. The default ports are 5985, which is the WinRM port for HTTP,
    and 5986, which is the WinRM port for HTTPS.

    Before using an alternate port, you must configure the WinRM listener on the remote computer to
    listen at that port. To configure the listener, type the following two commands at the PowerShell
    prompt:

    `Remove-Item -Path WSMan:\Localhost\listener\listener* -Recurse`

    `New-Item -Path WSMan:\Localhost\listener -Transport http -Address * -Port \<port-number\>`

    This parameter configures to the temporary connection that is created to run a `Get-PSSession`
    command with the **ComputerName** or **ConnectionUri** parameter.

    Do not use the **Port** parameter unless you must. The **Port** set in the command applies to all
    computers or sessions on which the command runs. An alternate port setting might prevent the command
    from running on all computers.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.Remoting.PSSessionOption" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: SessionOption
  description: |+
    Specifies advanced options for the session. Enter a **SessionOption** object, such as one that you
    create by using the New-PSSessionOption cmdlet, or a hash table in which the keys are session option
    names and the values are session option values.

    The default values for the options are determined by the value of the $PSSessionOption preference
    variable, if it is set. Otherwise, the default values are established by options set in the session
    configuration.

    The session option values take precedence over default values for sessions set in the
    $PSSessionOption preference variable and in the session configuration. However, they do not take
    precedence over maximum values, quotas or limits set in the session configuration.

    For a description of the session options, including the default values, see `New-PSSessionOption`.
    For information about the `$PSSessionOption` preference variable, see
    [about_Preference_Variables](About/about_Preference_Variables.md). For more information about
    session configurations, see [about_Session_Configurations](About/about_Session_Configurations.md).

- type: <xref href="Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.SessionFilterState" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: State
  description: |+
    Specifies a session state. This cmdlet gets only sessions in the specified state. The acceptable
    values for this parameter are: All, Opened, Disconnected, Closed, and Broken. The default value is
    All.

    The session state value is relative to the current sessions. Sessions that were not created in the
    current sessions and are not connected to the current session have a state of Disconnected even when
    they are connected to a different session.

    The state of a session is stored in the **State** property of the session.

  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to establish the connection
    in which the `Get-PSSession` command runs. By default, SSL is not used. If you use this parameter,
    but SSL is not available on the port used for the command, the command fails.

    This parameter configures the temporary connection that is created to run a `Get-PSSession` command
    with the **ComputerName** parameter.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

description: |-
  The `Get-PSSession` cmdlet gets the user-managed PowerShell sessions (**PSSessions**) on local and
  remote computers.

  Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, sessions are stored on the computers at the remote end of each
  connection. You can use the **ComputerName** or **ConnectionUri** parameters of `Get-PSSession` to
  get the sessions that connect to the local computer or remote computers, even if they were not
  created in the current session.

  Without parameters, `Get-PSSession` gets all sessions that were created in the current session.

  Use the filtering parameters, including **Name**, **ID**, **InstanceID**, **State**,
  **ApplicationName**, and **ConfigurationName** to select from among the sessions that
  `Get-PSSession` returns.

  Use the remaining parameters to configure the temporary connection in which the `Get-PSSession`
  command runs when you use the **ComputerName** or **ConnectionUri** parameters.

  NOTE: In Windows PowerShell 2.0, without parameters, `Get-PSSession` gets all sessions that were
  created in the current session. The **ComputerName** parameter gets sessions that were created in
  the current session and connect to the specified computer.

  For more information about PowerShell sessions, see [about_PSSessions](about/about_PSSessions.md).
