# Get-PSSnapin

## SYNOPSIS
Gets the Windows PowerShell snap-ins on the computer.

## SYNTAX

```
Get-PSSnapin [[-Name] <String[]>] [-Registered] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-PSSnapin** cmdlet gets the Windows PowerShell snap-ins that have been added to the current session or that have been registered on the system.
This cmdlet lists the snap-ins in the order in which they are detected.

**Get-PSSnapin** gets only registered snap-ins.
To register a Windows PowerShell snap-in, use the InstallUtil tool included with the Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0.
For more information, see [How to Register Cmdlets, Providers, and Host Applications](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=143619) in the MSDN library.

Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, the core commands that are included in Windows PowerShell are packaged in modules.
The exception is **Microsoft.PowerShell.Core**, which is a snap-in (PSSnapin).
By default, only the **Microsoft.PowerShell.Core** snap-in is added to the session.
Modules are imported automatically on first use and you can use the Import-Module cmdlet to import them.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get snap-ins that are currently loaded
```
PS C:\> Get-PSSnapIn
```

This command gets the Windows PowerShell snap-ins that are currently loaded in the session.
This includes the snap-ins that are installed with Windows PowerShell and those that have been added to the session.

### Example 2: Get snap-ins that have been registered
```
PS C:\> get-PSSnapIn -Registered
```

This command gets the Windows PowerShell snap-ins that have been registered on the computer, including those that have already been added to the session.
The output does not include snap-ins that are installed with Windows PowerShell or Windows PowerShell snap-in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that have not yet been registered on the system.

### Example 3: Get current snap-ins that match a string
```
PS C:\> Get-PSSnapIn -Name smp*
```

This command gets the Windows PowerShell snap-ins in the current session that have names that begin with smp.

## PARAMETERS

### -Name
Specifies an array of snap-in names.
This cmdlet gets only the specified Windows PowerShell snap-ins.
Wildcard characters are permitted.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Registered
Indicates that this cmdlet gets the Windows PowerShell snap-ins that have been registered on the system even if they have not yet been added to the session.

The snap-ins that are installed with Windows PowerShell do not appear in this list.

Without this parameter, **Get-PSSnapin** gets the Windows PowerShell snap-ins that have been added to the session.

## OUTPUTS

### System.Management.Automation.PSSnapInInfo
Get-PSSnapin returns an object for each snap-in that it gets.

## NOTES
* Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, the core commands that are installed with Windows PowerShell are packaged in modules. In Windows PowerShell 2.0, and in host programs that create older-style sessions in later versions of Windows PowerShell, the core commands are packaged in snap-ins (**PSSnapin**). The exception is **Microsoft.PowerShell.Core**, which is always a snap-in. Also, remote sessions, such as those started by the New-PSSession cmdlet, are older-style sessions that include core snap-ins.

  For information about the **CreateDefault2** method that creates newer-style sessions with core modules, see [CreateDefault2 Method](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.runspaces.initialsessionstate.createdefault2) in the MSDN library.
