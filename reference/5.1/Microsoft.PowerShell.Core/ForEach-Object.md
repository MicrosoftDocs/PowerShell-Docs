## DESCRIPTION

The `ForEach-Object` cmdlet performs an operation on each item in a collection of input objects. The
input objects can be piped to the cmdlet or specified by using the **InputObject** parameter.

Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, there are two different ways to construct a `ForEach-Object` command.

- **Script block**. You can use a script block to specify the operation. Within the script block,
  use the `$_` variable to represent the current object. The script block is the value of the
  **Process** parameter. The script block can contain any PowerShell script.

  For example, the following command gets the value of the **ProcessName** property of each process
  on the computer.

  `Get-Process | ForEach-Object {$_.ProcessName}`

  `ForEach-Object` supports the `begin`, `process`, and `end` blocks as described in
  [about_functions](about/about_functions.md#piping-objects-to-functions).

  > [!NOTE]
  > The script blocks run in the caller's scope. Therefore the blocks have access to variables in
  > that scope and can create new variables that persist in that scope after the cmdlet completes.

- **Operation statement**. You can also write an operation statement, which is much more like
  natural language. You can use the operation statement to specify a property value or call a
  method. Operation statements were introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  For example, the following command also gets the value of the **ProcessName** property of each
  process on the computer.

  `Get-Process | ForEach-Object ProcessName`

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Divide integers in an array

This example takes an array of three integers and divides each one of them by 1024.

```powershell
30000, 56798, 12432 | ForEach-Object -Process {$_/1024}
```

```Output
29.296875
55.466796875
12.140625
```

### Example 2: Get the length of all the files in a directory

This example processes the files and directories in the PowerShell installation directory `$PSHOME`.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem $PSHOME |
  ForEach-Object -Process {if (!$_.PSIsContainer) {$_.Name; $_.Length / 1024; " " }}
```

If the object is not a directory, the script block gets the name of the file, divides the value of
its **Length** property by 1024, and adds a space (" ") to separate it from the next entry. The
cmdlet uses the **PSISContainer** property to determine whether an object is a directory.

### Example 3: Operate on the most recent System events

This example write the 1000 most recent events from the System event log to a text file. The current
time is displayed before and after processing the events.

```powershell
$Events = Get-EventLog -LogName System -Newest 1000
$events | ForEach-Object -Begin {Get-Date} -Process {Out-File -FilePath Events.txt -Append -InputObject $_.Message} -End {Get-Date}
```

`Get-EventLog` gets the 1000 most recent events from the System event log and stores them in the
`$Events` variable. `$Events` is then piped to the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet. The **Begin** parameter
displays the current date and time. Next, the **Process** parameter uses the `Out-File` cmdlet to
create a text file that is named events.txt and stores the message property of each of the events in
that file. Last, the **End** parameter is used to display the date and time after all of the
processing has completed.

### Example 4: Change the value of a Registry key

This example changes the value of the **RemotePath** registry entry in all of the subkeys under the
`HKCU:\Network` key to uppercase text.

```powershell
Get-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\Network\* |
  ForEach-Object {Set-ItemProperty -Path $_.PSPath -Name RemotePath -Value $_.RemotePath.ToUpper();}
```

You can use this format to change the form or content of a registry entry value.

Each subkey in the **Network** key represents a mapped network drive that will reconnect at logon.
The **RemotePath** entry contains the UNC path of the connected drive. For example, if you map the
E: drive to `\\Server\Share`, there will be an **E** subkey of `HKCU:\Network` and the value of the
**RemotePath** registry entry in the **E** subkey is `\\Server\Share`.

The command uses the `Get-ItemProperty` cmdlet to get all of the subkeys of the **Network** key and
the `Set-ItemProperty` cmdlet to change the value of the **RemotePath** registry entry in each key.
In the `Set-ItemProperty` command, the path is the value of the **PSPath** property of the registry
key. This is a property of the Microsoft .NET Framework object that represents the registry key, not
a registry entry. The command uses the **ToUpper()** method of the **RemotePath** value, which is a
string (REG_SZ).

Because `Set-ItemProperty` is changing the property of each key, the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet is
required to access the property.

### Example 5: Use the $Null automatic variable

This example shows the effect of piping the `$Null` automatic variable to the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet.

```powershell
1, 2, $null, 4 | ForEach-Object {"Hello"}
```

```Output
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
```

Because PowerShell treats null as an explicit placeholder, the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet generates a
value for `$Null`, just as it does for other objects that you pipe to it.

### Example 6: Get property values

This example gets the value of the **Path** property of all installed PowerShell modules by using
the **MemberName** parameter of the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet.

```powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable | ForEach-Object -MemberName Path
Get-Module -ListAvailable | Foreach Path
```

The second command is equivalent to the first. It uses the `Foreach` alias of the `ForEach-Object`
cmdlet and omits the name of the **MemberName** parameter, which is optional.

The `ForEach-Object` cmdlet is very useful for getting property values, because it gets the value
without changing the type, unlike the **Format** cmdlets or the `Select-Object` cmdlet, which change
the property value type.

### Example 7: Split module names into component names

This examples shows three ways to split two dot-separated module names into their component names.

```powershell
"Microsoft.PowerShell.Core", "Microsoft.PowerShell.Host" | ForEach-Object {$_.Split(".")}
"Microsoft.PowerShell.Core", "Microsoft.PowerShell.Host" | ForEach-Object -MemberName Split -ArgumentList "."
"Microsoft.PowerShell.Core", "Microsoft.PowerShell.Host" | Foreach Split "."
```

```Output
Microsoft
PowerShell
Core
Microsoft
PowerShell
Host
```

The commands call the **Split** method of strings. The three commands use different syntax, but they
are equivalent and interchangeable.

The first command uses the traditional syntax, which includes a script block and the current object
operator `$_`. It uses the dot syntax to specify the method and parentheses to enclose the delimiter
argument.

The second command uses the **MemberName** parameter to specify the **Split** method and the
**ArgumentName** parameter to identify the dot (".") as the split delimiter.

The third command uses the **Foreach** alias of the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet and omits the names of
the **MemberName** and **ArgumentList** parameters, which are optional.

### Example 8: Using ForeEach-Object with two script blocks

In this example we pass two script blocks positionally. All the script blocks bind to the
**Process** parameter. However, they are treated as if they had been passed to the **Begin** and
**Process** parameters.

```powershell
1..2 | ForEach-Object { 'begin' } { 'process' }
```

```Output
begin
process
process
```

### Example 9: Using ForeEach-Object with more than two script blocks

In this example we pass two script blocks positionally. All the script blocks bind to the
**Process** parameter. However, they are treated as if they had been passed to the **Begin**,
**Process**, and **End** parameters.

```powershell
1..2 | ForEach-Object { 'begin' } { 'process A' }  { 'process B' }  { 'end' }
```

```Output
begin
process A
process B
process A
process B
end
```

> [!NOTE]
> The first script block is always mapped to the `begin` block, the last block is mapped to the
> `end` block, and the blocks in between are all mapped to the `process` block.

### Example 10: Run multiple script blocks for each pipeline item

As shown in the previous example, multiple script blocks passed using the **Process** parameter get
mapped to the **Begin** and **End** parameters. To avoid this mapping, you must provide explicit
values for the **Begin** and **End** parameters.

```powershell
1..2 | ForEach-Object -Begin $null -Process { 'one' }, { 'two' }, { 'three' } -End $null
```

```Output
one
two
three
one
two
three
```

## PARAMETERS

### -ArgumentList

Specifies an array of arguments to a method call. For more information about the behavior of
**ArgumentList**, see [about_Splatting](about/about_Splatting.md#splatting-with-arrays).

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: Object[]
Parameter Sets: PropertyAndMethodSet
Aliases: Args

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Begin

Specifies a script block that runs before this cmdlet processes any input objects. This script block
is only run once for the entire pipeline. For more information about the `begin` block, see
[about_Functions](about/about_functions.md#piping-objects-to-functions).

```yaml
Type: ScriptBlock
Parameter Sets: ScriptBlockSet
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -End

Specifies a script block that runs after this cmdlet processes all input objects. This script block
is only run once for the entire pipeline. For more information about the `end` block, see
[about_Functions](about/about_functions.md#piping-objects-to-functions).

```yaml
Type: ScriptBlock
Parameter Sets: ScriptBlockSet
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InputObject

Specifies the input objects. `ForEach-Object` runs the script block or operation statement on each
input object. Enter a variable that contains the objects, or type a command or expression that gets
the objects.

When you use the **InputObject** parameter with `ForEach-Object`, instead of piping command results
to `ForEach-Object`, the **InputObject** value is treated as a single object. This is true even if
the value is a collection that is the result of a command, such as `-InputObject (Get-Process)`.
Because **InputObject** cannot return individual properties from an array or collection of objects,
we recommend that if you use `ForEach-Object` to perform operations on a collection of objects for
those objects that have specific values in defined properties, you use `ForEach-Object` in the
pipeline, as shown in the examples in this topic.

```yaml
Type: PSObject
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MemberName

Specifies the property to get or the method to call.

Wildcard characters are permitted, but work only if the resulting string resolves to a unique value.
If, for example, you run `Get-Process | ForEach -MemberName *Name`, and more than one member exists
with a name that contains the string Name, such as the **ProcessName** and **Name** properties, the
command fails.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: PropertyAndMethodSet
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -Process

Specifies the operation that is performed on each input object. This script block is run for every
object in the pipeline. For more information about the `process` block, see
[about_Functions](about/about_functions.md#piping-objects-to-functions).

When you provide multiple script blocks to the **Process** parameter, the first script block is
always mapped to the `begin` block. If there are only two script blocks, the second block is mapped
to the `process` block. If there are three or more script blocks, first script block is always
mapped to the `begin` block, the last block is mapped to the `end` block, and the blocks in between
are all mapped to the `process` block.

```yaml
Type: ScriptBlock[]
Parameter Sets: ScriptBlockSet
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RemainingScripts

Specifies all script blocks that are not taken by the **Process** parameter.

This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: ScriptBlock[]
Parameter Sets: ScriptBlockSet
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs. The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable,
-InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose,
-WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see
[about_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### System.Management.Automation.PSObject

You can pipe any object to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### System.Management.Automation.PSObject

This cmdlet returns objects that are determined by the input.

## NOTES

- The `ForEach-Object` cmdlet works much like the **Foreach** statement, except that you cannot pipe
  input to a **Foreach** statement. For more information about the **Foreach** statement, see
  [about_Foreach](./About/about_Foreach.md).

- Starting in PowerShell 4.0, `Where` and `ForEach` methods were added for use with collections. You
  can read more about these new methods here [about_arrays](./About/about_Arrays.md)
