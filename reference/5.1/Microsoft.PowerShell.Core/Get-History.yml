### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Gets a list of the commands entered during the current session.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core
notes: |-
  The session history is a list of the commands entered during the session. The session history
  represents the run order, the status, and the start and end times of the command. As you enter each
  command, PowerShell adds it to the history so that you can reuse it. For more information about the
  command history, see [about_History](About/about_History.md).

  Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, the default value of the `$MaximumHistoryCount` preference
  variable is `4096`. In Windows PowerShell 2.0, the default value is `64`. For more information about
  the `$MaximumHistoryCount` variable, see [about_Preference_Variables](About/about_Preference_Variables.md).

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Get the session history'
  code: |-
    Get-History
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example gets the entries in the session history. The default display shows each command and its
    ID, which indicates the order in which they ran.

- title: 'Example 2: Get entries that include a string'
  code: |-
    Get-History | Where-Object {$_.CommandLine -like "*Service*"}
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example gets entries in the command history that include the string service. The first command
    gets all entries in the session history. The pipeline operator (`|`) passes the results to the
    `Where-Object` cmdlet, which selects only the commands that include service.

- title: 'Example 3: Export history entries up to a specific ID'
  code: |-
    Get-History -ID 7 -Count 5 | Export-Csv History.csv
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example gets the five most recent history entries ending with entry 7. The pipeline operator
    passes the result to the `Export-Csv` cmdlet, which formats the history as comma-separated text and
    saves it in the History.csv file. The file includes the data that is displayed when you format the
    history as a list. This includes the status and start and end times of the command.

- title: 'Example 4: Display the most recent command'
  code: |-
    Get-History -Count 1
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example gets the last command in the command history. The last command is the most recently
    entered command. This command uses the **Count** parameter to display just one command. By default,
    `Get-History` gets the most recent commands. This command can be abbreviated to "h -c 1" and is
    equivalent to pressing the up-arrow key.

- title: 'Example 5: Display all the properties of the entries in the history'
  code: |-
    Get-History | Format-List -Property *
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example displays all of the properties of entries in the session history. The pipeline operator
    passes the results of a `Get-History` command to the `Format-List` cmdlet, which displays all of the
    properties of each history entry. This includes the ID, status, and start and end times of the
    command.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Count
  description: |+
    Specifies the number of the most recent history entries that this cmdlet gets. By, default,
    `Get-History` gets all entries in the session history. If you use both the **Count** and **Id**
    parameters in a command, the display ends with the command that is specified by the **Id**
    parameter.

    In Windows PowerShell 2.0, by default, `Get-History` gets the 32 most recent entries.

  defaultValue: None
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Int64" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Id
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of the IDs of entries in the session history. `Get-History` gets only specified
    entries. If you use both the **Id** and **Count** parameters in a command, `Get-History` gets the
    most recent entries ending with the entry specified by the **Id** parameter.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core.Get-History
name: Get-History
description: |-
  The `Get-History` cmdlet gets the session history, that is, the list of commands entered during the
  current session.

  PowerShell automatically maintains a history of each session. The number of entries in the session
  history is determined by the value of the `$MaximumHistoryCount` preference variable. Beginning in
  Windows PowerShell 3.0, the default value is `4096`. By default, history files are saved in the home
  directory, but you can save the file in any location. For more information about the history
  features in PowerShell, see [about_History](About/about_History.md).

  The session history is managed separately from the history maintained by the **PSReadLine** module.
  Both histories are available in sessions where **PSReadLine** is loaded. This cmdlet only works with
  the session history. For more information see, [about_PSReadLine](../PSReadLine/About/about_PSReadLine.md).
