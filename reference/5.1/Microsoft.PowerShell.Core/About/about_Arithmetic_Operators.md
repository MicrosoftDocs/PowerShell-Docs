# About Arithmetic Operators

## SHORT DESCRIPTION

Describes the operators that perform arithmetic in Windows PowerShell.

## LONG DESCRIPTION


Arithmetic operators calculate numeric values. You can use one or more 
arithmetic operators to add, subtract, multiply, and divide values, 
and to calculate the remainder (modulus) of a division operation.

In addition, the addition operator (`+`) and multiplication operator (`*`) 
also operate on strings, arrays, and hash tables. 
The addition operator concatenates the input. The multiplication operator 
returns multiple copies of the input. 
You can even mix object types in an arithmetic statement. 
The method that is used to evaluate the statement is determined by the type of 
the leftmost object in the expression.

Beginning in Windows PowerShell 2.0, 
all arithmetic operators work on 64-bit numbers.

Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, 
the `-shr` (shift-right) and `-shl` (shift-left) are added to support 
bitwise arithmetic in Windows PowerShell.

Windows PowerShell supports the following arithmetic operators:

|Operator|Description|Example|
|--------|-----------|-------|
| + |Adds integers; concatenates strings,<br/> concatenates arrays, and hash tables.|`6 + 2`<br />`"file" + "name"`<br />`@(1, "one") + @(2.0, "two")`<br />`@{"one" = 1} + @{"two" = 2}`|  
| - |Subtracts one value from another value.|`6-2`<br />`(get-date).date - 1`|
| - |Makes a number a negative number.|`-6`|
| * |Multiplies numbers, copies strings and<br/>arrays the specified number of times.|`6 * 2`<br />`"!" * 3`<br />`@("!") * 4`|
| / |Divides two values.|`6 / 2`|
| % |Returns the remainder of a division operation.|`7 % 2`|
| -shl |Shifts bits to the left the specified number of times.<br/>Available only on integer types.|`100 -shl 2`|
| -shr |     Shifts bits to the right the specified  number of times.<br/>Available only on integer types.|`100 -shr 2`|

## OPERATOR PRECEDENCE

Windows PowerShell processes arithmetic operators in the following order:

Precedence | Operator| Description
-- | -- | --
1 | `()` | Parentheses
2 | `-` | For a negative number or unary operator
3 | `*`, `/`, `%` | 
4 | `+`, `-` | For addition and subtraction

Windows PowerShell processes the expressions from left to right according to 
the precedence rules. 
The following examples show the effect of the precedence rules:

Expression | Result
-- | --
`3+6/3*4` | `11`
`3+6/(3*4)` | `3.5`
`(3+6)/3*4` | `12`

The order in which Windows PowerShell evaluates expressions might differ from
other programming and scripting languages that you have used.
The following example shows a complicated assignment statement.

```powershell
$a = 0
$b = @(1,2)
$c = @(-1,-2)

$b[$a] = $c[$a++]
```

In this example, the expression `$a++` is evaluated before `$b[$a]`.
Evaluating `$a++` changes the value of `$a` after it is used in
the statement `$c[$a++]`; but, before it is used in `$b[$a]`.
The variable `$a` in `$b[$a]` equals `1`, not `0`; 
so, the statement assigns a value to `$b[1]`, not `$b[0]`.

The above code is equivalent to:

```powershell
$a = 0
$b = @(1,2)
$c = @(-1,-2)

$tmp = $c[$a]
$a = $a + 1
$b[$a] = $tmp
```

## DIVISION AND ROUNDING

When the quotient of a division operation is an integer, Windows PowerShell
rounds the value to the nearest integer. This is because powershell implements Bankersâ€™ Rounding.
When the value is `.5`, it rounds to the nearest even integer.

The following example shows the effect of rounding to the nearest even
integer.

Expression | Result
-- | --
`[int]( 5 / 2 )` | `2`
`[int]( 7 / 2 )` | `4`

Notice how **_5/2_ = 2.5** gets rounded to **2**.
But, **_7/2_ = 3.5** gets rounded to **4**.

## ADDING AND MULTIPLYING NON-NUMERIC TYPES

You can add numbers, strings, arrays, and hash tables.
And, you can multiply numbers, strings, and arrays.
However, you cannot multiply hash tables.

When you add strings, arrays, or hash tables, the elements are concatenated.
When you concatenate collections, such as arrays or hash tables,
a new object is created that contains the objects from both collections.
If you try to concatenate hash tables that have the same key, 
the operation fails.

For example, the following commands create two arrays and then add them:

```powershell
$a = 1,2,3
$b = "A","B","C"
$a + $b
```

```output
1
2
3
A
B
C
```

You can also perform arithmetic operations on objects of different types.
The operation that Windows PowerShell performs is determined by the
Microsoft .NET Framework type of the leftmost object in the operation.
Windows PowerShell tries to convert all the objects in the operation to the
.NET Framework type of the first object. If it succeeds in converting the
objects, it performs the operation appropriate to the .NET Framework type
of the first object. If it fails to convert any of the objects,
the operation fails.

The following examples demonstrate the use of the addition and
multiplication operators; in operations that include different object types.
Assume `$array = 1,2,3`:

Expression | Results
--- | ---
`"file" + 16` | `file16` 
`$array + 16` | `1`<br/>`2`<br/>`3`<br/>`16`
`$array + "file"` | `1`<br/>`2`<br/>`3`<br/>`file`
`"file" * 3` | `filefilefile`

Because the method that is used to evaluate statements is determined by the
leftmost object,
addition and multiplication in Windows PowerShell are not strictly
commutative.
For example, `(a + b)` does not always equal `(b + a)`,
and `(ab)` does not always equal `(ba)`.

The following examples demonstrate this principle:

Expression | Results
--- | ---
`"file" + 16` | `file16` 
`16 + "file"` | `Cannot convert value "file" to type "System.Int32".`<br/>`Error: "Input string was not in a correct format."`<br/>`At line:1 char:1`<br/>`+ 16 + "file"`

Hash tables are a slightly different case.
You can add hash tables to another hash table;
for as long the added hash tables don't have duplicate keys.

The following example show how to add hash tables to each other. 

```powershell
$hash1 = @{a=1; b=2; c=3}
$hash2 = @{c1="Server01"; c2="Server02"}
$hash1 + $hash2
```

```output
Name                           Value
----                           -----
c2                             Server02
a                              1
b                              2
c1                             Server01
c                              3
```

The following example throws an error because one of the keys 
is duplicated in both hash tables.

```powershell
$hash1 = @{a=1; b=2; c=3}
$hash2 = @{c1="Server01"; c="Server02"}
$hash1 + $hash2
```

```output
Item has already been added. Key in dictionary: 'c'  Key being added: 'c'
At line:3 char:1
+ $hash1 + $hash2
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : OperationStopped: (:) [], ArgumentException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.ArgumentException
```

Also, you can add a hash table to an array; and, the entire hash table becomes
an item in the array.

```powershell
$array1 = @(0, "Hello World", [datetime]::Now)
$hash1 = @{a=1; b=2}
$array2 = $array1 + $hash1
$array2
```

```output
0
Hello World

Monday, June 12, 2017 3:05:46 PM

Key   : a
Value : 1
Name  : a


Key   : b
Value : 2
Name  : b
```

However, you cannot add any other type to a hash table.

```powershell
$hash1 + 2
```

```output
A hash table can only be added to another hash table.
At line:3 char:1
+ $hash1 + 2
```

Although the addition operators are very useful,
use the assignment operators to add elements to hash tables and arrays. 
For more information see
[about_assignment_operators](about_Assignment_Operators.md). 
The following examples use the `+=` assignment operator to add items to an 
array:

```powershell
$array = @()
(0..9).foreach{ $array += $_ }
$array
```

```output
0
1
2
```

## TYPE CONVERSION TO ACCOMMODATE RESULT

Windows PowerShell automatically selects the .NET Framework numeric type that
best expresses the result without losing  precision.
For example:

```powershell
2 + 3.1

(2). GetType().FullName
(2 + 3.1).GetType().FullName
```

```output
5.1
System.Int32
System.Double
```

If the result of an operation is too large for the type, the type of the
result is widened to accommodate the result, as in the following example:

```powershell
(512MB).GetType().FullName
(512MB * 512MB).GetType().FullName
```

```output
System.Int32
System.Double
```

The type of the result will not necessarily be the same as one of the
operands.
In the following example, the negative value cannot be cast to an
unsigned integer, and the unsigned integer is too large to be cast to `Int32`:

```powershell
([int32]::minvalue + [uint32]::maxvalue).gettype().fullname
```

```output
System.Int64
```

In this example, `Int64` can accommodate both types.

The `System.Decimal` type is an exception.
If either operand has the Decimal type, the result will be of the
Decimal type.
If the result is too large for the Decimal type,
it will not be cast to Double. Instead, an error results.

Expression | Result
-- | --
`[Decimal]::maxvalue` | `79228162514264337593543950335`
`[Decimal]::maxvalue + 1` | `Value was either too large`<br/>`or too small for a Decimal.`

## ARITHMETIC OPERATORS AND VARIABLES

You can also use arithmetic operators with variables.
The operators act on the values of the variables.
The following examples demonstrate the use of arithmetic
operators with variables:

Expression | Result
-- | --
`$intA = 6`<br/>`$intB = 4`<br/>`$intA + $intB` | `10`
`$a = "Power"`<br/>`$b = "Shell"`<br/>`$a + $b` | `PowerShell`

## ARITHMETIC OPERATORS AND COMMANDS

Typically, you use the arithmetic operators in expressions with numbers,
strings, and arrays.
However, you can also use arithmetic operators with the objects that
commands return and with the properties of those objects.

The following examples show how to use the arithmetic operators in
expressions with Windows PowerShell commands:

```powershell
(get-date) + (new-timespan -day 1)
```

The parenthesis operator forces the evaluation of the `get-date` cmdlet
and the evaluation of the `new-timespan -day 1` cmdlet expression,
in that order.
Both results are then added using the `+` operator.

```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object { ($_.ws * 2) -gt 50mb }
```

```output
Handles  NPM(K)    PM(K)      WS(K) VM(M)   CPU(s)     Id ProcessName
-------  ------    -----      ----- -----   ------     -- -----------
   1896      39    50968      30620   264 1,572.55   1104 explorer
  12802      78   188468      81032   753 3,676.39   5676 OUTLOOK
    660       9    36168      26956   143    12.20    988 PowerShell
    561      14     6592      28144   110 1,010.09    496 services
   3476      80    34664      26092   234 ...45.69    876 svchost
    967      30    58804      59496   416   930.97   2508 WINWORD
```

In the above expression, each process working space (`$_.ws`) is multiplied
by `2`; and, the result, compared against `50mb` to see if it is greater
than that.

## EXAMPLES

The following examples show how to use the arithmetic operators in 
Windows PowerShell:

Expression | Result
-- | -- 
`1 + 1` | `2`
`1 - 1` | `0`
`-(6 + 3)` | `-9`
`6 * 2` | `12`
`7 / 2` | `3.5`
`7 % 2` | `1`
`'w' * 3` | `www`
`3 * 'w'` | `Cannot convert value "w" to type "System.Int32".`<br/>` Error: "Input string was not in a correct format."`
`"Power" + "Shell"` | `PowerShell`
`$a = "Power" + "Shell"`<br/>`$a[5]` | `S`
`$b = 1,2,3`<br/>`$b + 4` | `1`<br/>`2`<br/>`3`<br/>`4`
`$servers = @{`<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`0 = "LocalHost"`<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`1 = "Server01"`<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`2 = "Server02"`<br/>`}`<br/>`$servers + @{3 = "Server03"}` | `Name Value`<br/>`---- -----`<br/>`3    Server03`<br/>`2    Server02`<br/>`1    Server01`<br/>`0    LocalHost`
`#Use assignment operator`<br/>`$servers += @{3 = "Server03"}` | `Name Value`<br/>`---- -----`<br/>`3    Server03`<br/>`2    Server02`<br/>`1    Server01`<br/>`0    LocalHost`

## BITWISE ARITHMETIC IN WINDOWS POWERSHELL

Windows PowerShell supports the `-shl` (shift-left) and `-shr` (shift-right)
operators for bitwise arithmetic.
These operators are introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

In a bitwise shift-left operation,
all bits are moved "n" places to the left,
where "n" is the value of the right operand.
A zero is inserted in the ones place.

When the left operand is an Integer (32-bit) value,
the lower 5 bits of the right operand determine how many bits of the left
operand are shifted.

When the left operand is a Long (64-bit) value,
the lower 6 bits of the right operand determine how many bits of the left
operand are shifted.

Expression | Result
-- | --
`21 -shl 0` | `21`
`21 -shl 1` | `42`
`21 -shl 2` | `84`
`21 -shl 31` | `-2147483648`, [int]::MinValue
`21 -shl 32` | `21`
`21 -shl 64` | `21`
`21 -shl 65` | `42`
`21 -shl 66` | `84`
`[int]::MaxValue -shl 1` | `-2`

> **Binary value** (decimal value)
> - 00010101  (21)
> - 00101010  (42)
> - 01010100  (84)
> - 10000000000000000000000000000000 (-2147483648), [int]::MinValue
> - 1111111111111111111111111111111 (2147483647), [int]::MaxValue
> - 11111111111111111111111111111110 (-2)

In a bitwise shift-right operation, all bits are moved "n" places to the right,
where "n" is specified by the right operand.
The shift-right operator (-shr) inserts a zero in the left-most place when
shifting a positive or unsigned value to the right.

When the left operand is an Integer (32-bit) value,
the lower 5 bits of the right operand determine how many bits of the left
operand are shifted.

When the left operand is a Long (64-bit) value,
the lower 6 bits of the right operand determine how many bits of the left
operand are shifted.

Expression | Result
-- | --
`21 -shr 0` | `21`
`21 -shr 1` | `10`
`21 -shr 2` | `5`
`21 -shr 31` | `0`
`21 -shr 32` | `21`
`21 -shr 64` | `21`
`21 -shr 65` | `10`
`21 -shr 66` | `5`
`[int]::MaxValue -shr 1` | `1073741823`
`[int]::MinValue -shr 1` | `-1073741824`
`-1 -shr 1` | `-1`

> **Binary value** (decimal value)
> - 00010101  (21)
> - 00001010  (10)
> - 00000101  (5)
> - 10000000000000000000000000000000 (-2147483648), [int]::MinValue
> - 1111111111111111111111111111111 (2147483647), [int]::MaxValue
> - 111111111111111111111111111111 (1073741823)
> - 11000000000000000000000000000000 (-1073741824)
