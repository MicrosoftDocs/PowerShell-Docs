# about_Hidden
## TOPIC  
 about\_Hidden  
  
## SHORT DESCRIPTION  
 Describes the Hidden keyword, which hides class members from default Get\-Member results.  
  
## LONG DESCRIPTION  
 When you use the Hidden keyword in a script, you hide the members of a class by default. The Hidden keyword can hide properties, methods \(including constructors, events, alias properties, and other member types, including static members, from the default results of the Get\-Member cmdlet, and from IntelliSense and tab completion results. To display members that you have hidden with the Hidden keyword, add the \-Force parameter to a Get\-Member command.  
  
 Hidden members are not displayed by using tab completion or IntelliSense, unless the completion occurs in the class that defines the hidden member.  
  
 A new attribute, System.Management.Automation.HiddenAttribute, has been added, so that C\# code can have the same semantics within Windows PowerShell.  
  
 The Hidden keyword is useful for creating properties and methods within a class that you do not necessarily want other users of the class to see, or readily be able to edit.  
  
 The Hidden keyword has no effect on how you can view or make changes to members of a class. Like all language keywords in Windows PowerShell, Hidden is not case\-sensitive, and hidden members are still public.  
  
 Hidden, along with custom classes, was introduced in Windows PowerShell 5.0.  
  
## EXAMPLE  
 The following example shows how to use the Hidden keyword in a class definition. The Car class method, Drive, has a property, rides, that does not need to be viewed or changed \(it merely tallies the number of times that Drive is called on the Car class, a metric that is not important to users of the class; consider, for example, that when you are buying a car, you do not ask the seller on how many drives the car has been taken\).  
  
 Because there is little need for users of the class to change this property, we can hide the property from Get\-Member and automatic completion results by using the Hidden keyword.  
  
 Add the Hidden keyword by entering it on the same statement line as the property and its data type. Although the keyword can be in any order on this line, starting the statement with the Hidden keyword makes it easier for you later to identify all members that you have hidden.  
  
```  
class Car  
{  
   # Properties  
   [String] $Color  
   [String] $ModelYear  
   [int] $Distance  
  
   # Method  
   [int] Drive ([int]$miles)  
   {  
      $this.Distance += $miles  
      $this.rides++  
      return $this.Distance  
   }  
  
   # Hidden property of the Drive method  
    hidden [int] $rides = 0  
}  
  
```  
  
 Now, create a new instance of the Car class, and save it in a variable, $TestCar.  
  
```  
  
$TestCar = [Car]::new()  
  
```  
  
 After you create the new instance, pipe the contents of the $TestCar variable to Get\-Member. Observe that the rides property is not among the members listed in the Get\-Member command results.  
  
```  
PS C:\Windows\system32> $TestCar | Get-Member  
  
   TypeName: Car  
  
Name        MemberType Definition                      
----        ---------- ----------                      
Drive       Method     int Drive(int miles)            
Equals      Method     bool Equals(System.Object obj)  
GetHashCode Method     int GetHashCode()               
GetType     Method     type GetType()                  
ToString    Method     string ToString()               
Color       Property   string Color {get;set;}         
Distance    Property   int Distance {get;set;}         
ModelYear   Property   string ModelYear {get;set;}  
  
```  
  
 Now, try running Get\-Member again, but this time, add the –Force parameter. Note that the results contain the hidden rides property, among other members that are hidden by default.  
  
```  
PS C:\Windows\system32> $TestCar | Get-Member -Force  
  
   TypeName: Car
