# About Pipelines

## Short description

Combining commands into pipelines in the PowerShell

## Long description

A pipeline is a series of commands connected by pipeline operators (`|`)
(ASCII 124). Each pipeline operator sends the results of the preceding command
to the next command.

The output of the first command can be sent for processing as input to the
second command. And that output can be sent to yet another command. The result
is a complex command chain or _pipeline_ that is composed of a series of
simple commands.

For example,

```powershell
Command-1 | Command-2 | Command-3
```

In this example, the objects that `Command-1` emits are sent to `Command-2`.
`Command-2` processes the objects and sends them to `Command-3`. `Command-3`
processes the objects and send them down the pipeline. Because there are no
more commands in the pipeline, the results are displayed at the console.

In a pipeline, the commands are processed in order from left to right. The
processing is handled as a single operation and output is displayed as it's
generated.

Here is a simple example. The following command gets the Notepad process and
then stops it.

For example,

```powershell
Get-Process notepad | Stop-Process
```

The first command uses the `Get-Process` cmdlet to get an object representing
the Notepad process. It uses a pipeline operator (`|`) to send the process
object to the `Stop-Process` cmdlet, which stops the Notepad process. Notice
that the `Stop-Process` command doesn't have a **Name** or **ID** parameter to
specify the process, because the specified process is submitted through the
pipeline.

This pipeline example gets the text files in the current directory, selects
only the files that are more than 10,000 bytes long, sorts them by length, and
displays the name and length of each file in a table.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path *.txt |
  Where-Object {$_.length -gt 10000} |
    Sort-Object -Property length |
      Format-Table -Property name, length
```

This pipeline consists of four commands in the specified order. The following
illustration shows the output from each command as it's passed to the next
command in the pipeline.

```
Get-ChildItem -Path *.txt
| (FileInfo objects for *.txt)
V
Where-Object {$_.length -gt 10000}
| (FileInfo objects for *.txt)
| (      Length > 10000      )
V
Sort-Object -Property Length
| (FileInfo objects for *.txt)
| (      Length > 10000      )
| (     Sorted by length     )
V
Format-Table -Property name, length
| (FileInfo objects for *.txt)
| (      Length > 10000      )
| (     Sorted by length     )
| (   Formatted in a table   )
V

Name                       Length
----                       ------
tmp1.txt                    82920
tmp2.txt                   114000
tmp3.txt                   114000
```

## Using pipelines

Most PowerShell cmdlets are designed to support pipelines. In most cases, you
can _pipe_ the results of a **Get** cmdlet to another cmdlet of the same noun.
For example, you can pipe the output of the `Get-Service` cmdlet to the
`Start-Service` or `Stop-Service` cmdlets.

This example pipeline starts the WMI service on the computer:

```powershell
Get-Service wmi | Start-Service
```

For another example, you can pipe the output of `Get-Item` or `Get-ChildItem`
within the PowerShell registry provider to the `New-ItemProperty` cmdlet. This
example adds a new registry entry, **NoOfEmployees**, with a value of **8124**,
to the **MyCompany** registry key.

```powershell
Get-Item -Path HKLM:\Software\MyCompany |
  New-ItemProperty -Name NoOfEmployees -Value 8124
```

Many of the utility cmdlets, such as `Get-Member`, `Where-Object`,
`Sort-Object`, `Group-Object`, and `Measure-Object` are used almost exclusively
in pipelines. You can pipe any object type to these cmdlets. This example shows
how to sort all the processes on the computer by the number of open handles in
each process.

```powershell
Get-Process | Sort-Object -Property handles
```

You can pipe objects to the formatting, export, and output cmdlets, such as
`Format-List`, `Format-Table`, `Export-Clixml`, `Export-CSV`, and `Out-File`.

This example shows how to use the `Format-List` cmdlet to display a list of
properties for a process object.

```powershell
Get-Process winlogon | Format-List -Property *
```

With a bit of practice, you'll find that combining simple commands into
pipelines saves time and typing, and makes your scripting more efficient.

## How pipelines work

This section explains how input objects are bound to cmdlet parameters and
processed during pipeline execution.

### Accepts pipeline input

To support pipelining, the receiving cmdlet must have a parameter that accepts
pipeline input. Use the `Get-Help` command with the **Full** or **Parameter**
options to determine which parameters of a cmdlet accept pipeline input.

For example, to determine which of the parameters of the `Start-Service`
cmdlet accepts pipeline input, type:

```powershell
Get-Help Start-Service -Full
```

or

```powershell
Get-Help Start-Service -Parameter *
```

The help for the `Start-Service` cmdlet shows that only the **InputObject** and
**Name** parameters accept pipeline input.

```Output
-InputObject <ServiceController[]>
Specifies ServiceController objects representing the services to be started.
Enter a variable that contains the objects, or type a command or expression
that gets the objects.

Required?                    true
Position?                    0
Default value                None
Accept pipeline input?       True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters?  false

-Name <String[]>
Specifies the service names for the service to be started.

The parameter name is optional. You can use Name or its alias, ServiceName,
or you can omit the parameter name.

Required?                    true
Position?                    0
Default value                None
Accept pipeline input?       True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters?  false
```

When you send objects through the pipeline to `Start-Service`, PowerShell
attempts to associate the objects with the **InputObject** and **Name**
parameters.

### Methods of accepting pipeline input

Cmdlets parameters can accept pipeline input in one of two different ways:

- **ByValue**: The parameter accepts values that match the expected .NET type
  or that can be converted to that type.

  For example, the **Name** parameter of `Start-Service` accepts pipeline input
  by value. It can accept string objects or objects that can be converted to
  strings.

- **ByPropertyName**: The parameter accepts input only when the input object
  has a property of the same name as the parameter.

  For example, the Name parameter of `Start-Service` can accept objects that
  have a **Name** property. To list the properties of an object, pipe it to
  `Get-Member`.

Some parameters can accept objects by both value or property name, making it
easier to take input from the pipeline.

### Parameter binding

When you pipe objects from one command to another command, PowerShell attempts
to associate the piped objects with a parameter of the receiving cmdlet.

PowerShell's parameter binding component associates the input objects with
cmdlet parameters according to the following criteria:

- The parameter must accept input from a pipeline.
- The parameter must accept the type of object being sent or a type that can be
  converted to the expected type.
- The parameter wasn't used in the command.

For example, the `Start-Service` cmdlet has many parameters, but only two of
them, **Name** and **InputObject** accept pipeline input. The **Name**
parameter takes strings and the **InputObject** parameter takes service
objects. Therefore, you can pipe strings, service objects, and objects with
properties that can be converted to string or service objects.

PowerShell manages parameter binding as efficiently as possible. You can't
suggest or force the PowerShell to bind to a specific parameter. The command
fails if PowerShell can't bind the piped objects.

For more information about troubleshooting binding errors, see
[Investigating Pipeline Errors](#investigating-pipeline-errors) later in this
article.

### One-at-a-time processing

Piping objects to a command is much like using a parameter of the command to
submit the objects. Let's look at a pipeline example. In this example, we use a
pipeline to display a table of service objects.

```powershell
Get-Service | Format-Table -Property Name, DependentServices
```

Functionally, this is like using the **InputObject** parameter of `Format-Table`
to submit the object collection.

For example, we can save the collection of services to a variable that is
passed using the **InputObject** parameter.

```powershell
$services = Get-Service
Format-Table -InputObject $services -Property Name, DependentServices
```

Or we can embed the command in the **InputObject** parameter.

```powershell
Format-Table -InputObject (Get-Service) -Property Name, DependentServices
```

However, there's an important difference. When you pipe multiple objects to a
command, PowerShell sends the objects to the command one at a time. When you
use a command parameter, the objects are sent as a single array object. This
minor difference has significant consequences.

When executing a pipeline, PowerShell automatically enumerates any type that
implements the `IEnumerable` interface and sends the members through the
pipeline one at a time. The exception is `[hashtable]`, which requires a call
to the `GetEnumerator()` method.

In the following examples, an array and a hashtable are piped to the `Measure-Object`
cmdlet to count the number of objects received from the pipeline. The array
has multiple members, and the hashtable has multiple key-value pairs. Only the
array is enumerated one at a time.

```powershell
@(1,2,3) | Measure-Object
```

```Output
Count    : 3
Average  :
Sum      :
Maximum  :
Minimum  :
Property :
```

```powershell
@{"One"=1;"Two"=2} | Measure-Object
```

```Output
Count    : 1
Average  :
Sum      :
Maximum  :
Minimum  :
Property :
```

Similarly, if you pipe multiple process objects from the `Get-Process` cmdlet
to the `Get-Member` cmdlet, PowerShell sends each process object, one at a
time, to `Get-Member`. `Get-Member` displays the .NET class (type) of the
process objects, and their properties and methods.

```powershell
Get-Process | Get-Member
```

```Output
TypeName: System.Diagnostics.Process

Name      MemberType     Definition
----      ----------     ----------
Handles   AliasProperty  Handles = Handlecount
Name      AliasProperty  Name = ProcessName
NPM       AliasProperty  NPM = NonpagedSystemMemorySize
...
```

> [!NOTE]
> `Get-Member` eliminates duplicates, so if the objects are all of the same
> type, it only displays one object type.

However, if you use the **InputObject** parameter of `Get-Member`, then
`Get-Member` receives an array of **System.Diagnostics.Process** objects as a
single unit. It displays the properties of an array of objects. (Note the
array symbol (`[]`) after the **System.Object** type name.)

For example,

```powershell
Get-Member -InputObject (Get-Process)
```

```Output
TypeName: System.Object[]

Name               MemberType    Definition
----               ----------    ----------
Count              AliasProperty Count = Length
Address            Method        System.Object& Address(Int32 )
Clone              Method        System.Object Clone()
...
```

This result might not be what you intended. But after you understand it, you
can use it. For example, all array objects have a **Count** property. You can
use that to count the number of processes running on the computer.

For example,

```powershell
(Get-Process).count
```

It's important to remember that objects sent down the pipeline are delivered
one at a time.

## Investigating pipeline errors

When PowerShell can't associate the piped objects with a parameter of the
receiving cmdlet, the command fails.

In the following example, we try to move a registry entry from one registry
key to another. The `Get-Item` cmdlet gets the destination path, which
is then piped to the `Move-ItemProperty` cmdlet. The `Move-ItemProperty`
command specifies the current path and name of the registry entry to be moved.

```powershell
Get-Item -Path HKLM:\Software\MyCompany\sales |
Move-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\Software\MyCompany\design -Name product
```

The command fails and PowerShell displays the following error
message:

```Output
Move-ItemProperty : The input object can't be bound to any parameters for
the command either because the command doesn't take pipeline input or the
input and its properties do not match any of the parameters that take
pipeline input.
At line:1 char:23
+ $a | Move-ItemProperty <<<<  -Path HKLM:\Software\MyCompany\design -Name p
```

To investigate, use the `Trace-Command` cmdlet to trace the parameter binding
component of PowerShell. The following example traces parameter binding while
the pipeline is executing. The **PSHost** parameter displays the trace results
in the console and the **FilePath** parameter send the trace results to the
`debug.txt` file for later reference.

```powershell
Trace-Command -Name ParameterBinding -PSHost -FilePath debug.txt -Expression {
  Get-Item -Path HKLM:\Software\MyCompany\sales |
    Move-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\Software\MyCompany\design -Name product
}
```

The results of the trace are lengthy, but they show the values being bound to
the `Get-Item` cmdlet and then the named values being bound to the
`Move-ItemProperty` cmdlet.

```Output
...
BIND NAMED cmd line args [`Move-ItemProperty`]
BIND arg [HKLM:\Software\MyCompany\design] to parameter [Path]
...
BIND arg [product] to parameter [Name]
...
BIND POSITIONAL cmd line args [`Move-ItemProperty`]
...
```

Finally, it shows that the attempt to bind the path to the **Destination**
parameter of `Move-ItemProperty` failed.

```Output
...
BIND PIPELINE object to parameters: [`Move-ItemProperty`]
PIPELINE object TYPE = [Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey]
RESTORING pipeline parameter's original values
Parameter [Destination] PIPELINE INPUT ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName NO
COERCION
Parameter [Credential] PIPELINE INPUT ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName NO
COERCION
...
```

Use the `Get-Help` cmdlet to view the attributes of the **Destination** parameter.

```Output
Get-Help Move-ItemProperty -Parameter Destination

-Destination <String>
    Specifies the path to the destination location.

    Required?                    true
    Position?                    1
    Default value                None
    Accept pipeline input?       True (ByPropertyName)
    Accept wildcard characters?  false
```

The results show that **Destination** takes pipeline input only "by property
name". Therefore, the piped object must have a property named **Destination**.

Use `Get-Member` to see the properties of the object coming from `Get-Item`.

```powershell
Get-Item -Path HKLM:\Software\MyCompany\sales | Get-Member
```

The output shows that the item is a **Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey** object that
doesn't have a **Destination** property. That explains why the command failed.

The **Path** parameter accepts pipeline input by name or by value.

```Output
Get-Help Move-ItemProperty -Parameter Path

-Path <String[]>
    Specifies the path to the current location of the property. Wildcard
    characters are permitted.

    Required?                    true
    Position?                    0
    Default value                None
    Accept pipeline input?       True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
    Accept wildcard characters?  true
```

To fix the command, we must specify the destination in the `Move-ItemProperty`
cmdlet and use `Get-Item` to get the **Path** of the item we want to move.

For example,

```powershell
Get-Item -Path HKLM:\Software\MyCompany\design |
Move-ItemProperty -Destination HKLM:\Software\MyCompany\sales -Name product
```

## Intrinsic line continuation

As already discussed, a pipeline is a series of commands connected by pipeline
operators (`|`), usually written on a single line. However, for
readability, PowerShell allows you to split the pipeline across multiple lines.
When a pipe operator is the last token on the line, the PowerShell parser joins
the next line to current command to continue the construction of the pipeline.

For example, the following single-line pipeline:

```powershell
Command-1 | Command-2 | Command-3
```

can be written as:

```powershell
Command-1 |
  Command-2 |
    Command-3
```

The leading spaces on the subsequent lines are not significant. The indentation
enhances readability.
