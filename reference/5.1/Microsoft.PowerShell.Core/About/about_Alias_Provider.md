# Alias provider

## Provider name

Alias

## Drives

`Alias:`

## Capabilities

**ShouldProcess**

## Short description

Provides access to the PowerShell aliases and the values that they represent.

## Detailed description

The PowerShell **Alias** provider lets you get, add, change, clear, and delete
aliases in PowerShell.

An alias is an alternate name for a cmdlet, function, executable file,
including scripts. PowerShell includes a set of built-in aliases. You can add
your own aliases to the current session and to your PowerShell profile.

The **Alias** drive is a flat namespace that contains only the alias objects.
The aliases have no child items.

The **Alias** provider supports the following cmdlets, which are covered
in this article.

- [Get-Location](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Location.md)
- [Set-Location](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Set-Location.md)
- [Get-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Item.md)
- [New-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/New-Item.md)
- [Remove-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Remove-Item.md)
- [Clear-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Clear-Item.md)

PowerShell includes a set of cmdlets that are designed to view and to change aliases. When you use **Alias** cmdlets, you do not need to specify the `Alias:` drive in the name. This article does not cover working with
**Alias** cmdlets.

- [Export-Alias](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Export-Alias.md)
- [Get-Alias](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Get-Alias.md)
- [Import-Alias](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Import-Alias.md)
- [New-Alias](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/New-Alias.md)
- [Set-Alias](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Set-Alias.md)

## Types exposed by this provider

Each alias is an instance of the
[System.Management.Automation.AliasInfo](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.aliasinfo) class.

## Navigating the Alias drive

The **Alias** provider exposes its data store in the `Alias:` drive. To work
with aliases, you can change your location to the `Alias:` drive by using the
following command:

```powershell
Set-Location Alias:
```

To return to a file system drive, type the drive name. For example, type:

```powershell
Set-Location C:
```

You can also work with the Alias provider from any other PowerShell drive. To
reference an alias from another location, use the `Alias:` drive name in the
path.

> [!NOTE]
> PowerShell uses aliases to allow you a familiar way to work with provider
> paths. Commands such as `dir` and `ls` are now aliases for
> [Get-ChildItem](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-ChildItem.md),
> `cd` is an alias for [Set-Location](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Set-Location.md). and `pwd` is
> an alias for [Get-Location](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Get-Location.md).

### Displaying the Contents of the Alias: drive

This command gets the list of all the aliases when the current location is the
`Alias:` drive. It uses a wildcard character `*` to indicate all the contents
of the current location.

```powershell
PS Alias:\> Get-Item -Path *
```

In the `Alias:` drive, a dot `.`, which represents the current location, and a
wildcard character `*`, which represents all items in the current location,
have the same effect. For example, `Get-Item -Path .` or `Get-Item \*` produce
the same result.

The Alias provider has no containers, so the above command has the
same effect when used with `Get-ChildItem`.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path Alias:
```

### Get a selected alias

This command gets the `ls` alias.
Because it includes the path, you can use it in any PowerShell drive.

```powershell
Get-Item -Path Alias:ls
```

If you are in the `Alias:` drive, you can omit the drive name from the path.

### Get all aliases for a specific cmdlet

This command gets a list of the aliases that are associated with the
`Get-ChildItem` cmdlet. It uses the **Definition** property, which stores
the cmdlet name.

```powershell
Get-Item -Path Alias:* | Where-Object {$_.Definition -eq "Get-ChildItem"}
```

## Creating aliases

### Create an alias from the Alias: drive

This command creates the `serv` alias for the `Get-Service` cmdlet. Because the
current location is in the `Alias:` drive, the `-Path` parameter is not
needed.

This command also uses the `-Options` dynamic parameter to set the **AllScope**
option on the alias. The `-Options` parameter is available in
the `New-Item` cmdlet only when you are in the `Alias:` drive. The dot (`.`)
indicates the current directory, which is the alias drive.

```powershell
PS Alias:\> New-Item -Path . `
                     -Name serv `
                     -Value Get-Service `
                     -Options "AllScope"
```

### Create an alias with an absolute path

You can create an alias for any item that invokes a command.
This command creates the `np` alias for `Notepad.exe`.

```powershell
New-Item -Path Alias:np -Value c:\windows\notepad.exe
```

### Create an alias to a new function

You can create an alias for any function. You can use this feature to create an
alias that includes both a cmdlet and its parameters.

The first command creates the `CD32` function, which changes the current
directory to the `System32` directory. The second command creates the `go`
alias for the `CD32` function.

When the command is complete, you can use either `CD32` or `go` to invoke the
function.

```powershell
function CD32 {Set-Location -Path c:\windows\system32}
Set-Item -Path Alias:go -Value CD32
```

## Changing aliases

### Change the options of an alias

You can use the `Set-Item` cmdlet with the `-Options` dynamic parameter to
change the value of the `-Options` property of an alias.

This command sets the **AllScope** and **ReadOnly** options for the `dir`
alias. The command uses the `-Options` dynamic parameter of the `Set-Item`
cmdlet. The `-Options` parameter is available in `Set-Item` when you use it
with the **Alias** or **Function** provider.

```powershell
Set-Item -Path Alias:dir -Options "AllScope,ReadOnly"
```

### Change an aliases referenced command

This command uses the `Set-Item` cmdlet to change the `gp` alias so that it
represents the `Get-Process` cmdlet instead of the `Get-ItemProperty` cmdlet.
The `-Force` parameter is required because the value of the **Options**
property of the `gp` alias is set to `ReadOnly`. Because the command is
submitted from within the `Alias:` drive, the drive is not specified in the
path.

```powershell
Set-Item -Path gp -Value Get-Process -Force
```

The change affects the four properties that define the association between the
alias and the command. To view the effect of the change, type the following
command:

```powershell
Get-Item -Path gp | Format-List -Property *
```

### Rename an alias

This command uses the `Rename-Item` cmdlet to change the `popd` alias to `pop`.

```powershell
Rename-Item -Path Alias:popd -NewName pop
```

## Copying an alias

This command copies the `pushd` alias so that a new `push` alias is created for
the `Push-Location` cmdlet.

When the new alias is created, its **Description** property has a null value.
And, its **Option** property has a value of `None`. If the command is issued
from within the `Alias:` drive, you can omit the drive name from the value of
the `-Path` parameter.

```powershell
Copy-Item -Path Alias:pushd -Destination Alias:push
```

## Deleting an alias

This command deletes the `serv` alias from the current session.
You can use this command in any PowerShell drive.

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path Alias:serv
```

This command deletes aliases that begin with "s".
It does not delete read-only aliases.

```powershell
Clear-Item -Path Alias:s*
```

### Delete read-only aliases

This command deletes all aliases from the current session, except those with a
value of `Constant` for their **Options** property. The `-Force`
parameter allows the command to delete aliases whose **Options** property has a
value of `ReadOnly`.

```powershell
Remove-Item Alias:* -Force
```

## Dynamic parameters

Dynamic parameters are cmdlet parameters that are added by a PowerShell
provider and are available only when the cmdlet is being used in the
provider-enabled drive.

### Options [System.Management.Automation.ScopedItemOptions]

Determines the value of the **Options** property of an alias.

- `None`: No options. This value is the default.
- `Constant`:The alias cannot be deleted and its properties cannot be changed.
  `Constant` is available only when you create an alias. You cannot change the option of an existing alias to `Constant`.
- `Private`:The alias is visible only in the current scope, not in the child
   scopes.
- `ReadOnly`:The properties of the alias cannot be changed except by using the
  `-Force` parameter. You can use `Remove-Item` to delete the alias.
- `AllScope`:The alias is copied to any new scopes that are created.

#### Cmdlets supported

- [New-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/New-Item.md)
- [Set-Item](../../Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Set-Item.md)

## Using the pipeline

Provider cmdlets accept pipeline input. You can use the pipeline to simplify
task by sending provider data from one cmdlet to another provider cmdlet.
To read more about how to use the pipeline with provider cmdlets, see the
cmdlet references provided throughout this article.

## Getting help

Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, you can get customized help topics for
provider cmdlets that explain how those cmdlets behave in a file system drive.

To get the help topics that are customized for the file system drive, run a
[Get-Help](../Get-Help.md) command in a file system drive or use the `-Path`
parameter of [Get-Help](../Get-Help.md) to specify a file system drive.

```powershell
Get-Help Get-ChildItem
```

```powershell
Get-Help Get-ChildItem -Path alias:
```
