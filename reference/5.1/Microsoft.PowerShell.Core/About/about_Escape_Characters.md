# About Escape Characters
## about_Escape_Characters


# SHORT DESCRIPTION

Introduces the escape character in Windows PowerShell and explains
its effect.

# LONG DESCRIPTION

Escape characters are used to assign a special interpretation to
the characters that follow it.

In Windows PowerShell, the escape character is the backtick (`), also
called the grave accent (ASCII 96). The escape character can be used
to indicate a literal, to indicate line continuation, and to indicate
special characters.

In a call to another program, instead of using escape characters
to prevent Windows PowerShell from misinterpreting program arguments,
you can use the stop-parsing symbol (--%). The stop-parsing symbol
is introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

# ESCAPING A VARIABLE

When an escape character precedes a variable, it prevents a value from
being substituted for the variable.

For example:

PS C:> $a = 5
PS C:\> "The value is stored in $a."
The value is stored in 5.

PS C:> $a = 5
PS C:\> "The value is stored in `$a."
The value is stored in $a.

# ESCAPING QUOTATION MARKS


When an escape character precedes a
double quotation mark, Windows PowerShell interprets the double quotation
mark as a character, not as a string delimiter.

PS C:> "Use quotation marks (") to indicate a string."
Unexpected token ')' in expression or statement.
At line:1 char:25
+ "Use quotation marks (") <<<<  to indicate a string."

PS C:> "Use quotation marks (`") to indicate a string."
Use quotation marks (") to indicate a string.

# USING LINE CONTINUATION


The escape character tells Windows PowerShell that the command continues
on the next line.

For example:

PS C:> Get-Process `
>> PowerShell

Handles  NPM(K)    PM(K)      WS(K) VM(M)   CPU(s)     Id ProcessName
-------  ------    -----      ----- -----   ------     -- -----------

# USING SPECIAL CHARACTERS


When used within quotation marks, the escape character indicates a
special character that provides instructions to the command parser.

The following special characters are recognized by Windows PowerShell:

`0    Null
`a    Alert
`b    Backspace
`f    Form feed
`n    New line
`r    Carriage return
`t    Horizontal tab
`v    Vertical tab

For example:

PS C:> "12345678123456781`nCol1`tColumn2`tCol3"
# 12345678123456781

Col1    Column2 Col3

# STOP-PARSING SYMBOL

When calling other programs, you can use the stop-parsing
symbol (--%) to prevent Windows PowerShell from generating
errors or misinterpreting program arguments. The stop-parsing
symbol is an alternative to using escape characters in program
calls. It is introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

For example, the following command uses the stop-parsing
symbol in an Icacls command:

icacls X:\VMS --% /grant Dom\HVAdmin:(CI)(OI)F

For more information about the stop-parsing symbol,
see about_Parsing.
