# Enable-PSRemoting

## SYNOPSIS
Configures the computer to receive remote commands.

## SYNTAX

```
Enable-PSRemoting [-Force] [-SkipNetworkProfileCheck] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Enable-PSRemoting` cmdlet configures the computer to receive PowerShell remote commands that
are sent by using the WS-Management technology.

PowerShell remoting is enabled by default on Windows Server 2012. You can use `Enable-PSRemoting`
to enable PowerShell remoting on other supported versions of Windows and to re-enable remoting on
Windows Server 2012 if it becomes disabled.

You have to run this command only one time on each computer that will receive commands. You do not
have to run it on computers that only send commands. Because the configuration starts listeners, it
is prudent to run it only where it is needed.

Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, the `Enable-PSRemoting` cmdlet can enable PowerShell remoting
on client versions of Windows when the computer is on a public network. For more information, see
the description of the **SkipNetworkProfileCheck** parameter.

The `Enable-PSRemoting` cmdlet performs the following operations:

- Runs the [Set-WSManQuickConfig](../Microsoft.WSMan.Management/Set-WSManQuickConfig.md) cmdlet,
  which performs the following tasks:
  - Starts the WinRM service.
  - Sets the startup type on the WinRM service to Automatic.
  - Creates a listener to accept requests on any IP address.
  - Enables a firewall exception for WS-Management communications.
  - Registers the **Microsoft.PowerShell** and **Microsoft.PowerShell.Workflow** session
    configurations, if it they are not already registered.
  - Registers the **Microsoft.PowerShell32** session configuration on 64-bit computers, if it is
    not already registered.
  - Enables all session configurations.
  - Changes the security descriptor of all session configurations to allow remote access.
- Restarts the WinRM service to make the preceding changes effective.

To run this cmdlet on the Windows platform, start PowerShell by using the Run as administrator
option. This does not apply to Linux or MacOS versions of PowerShell.

> [!CAUTION]
> On systems that have both PowerShell 3.0 and PowerShell 2.0, do not use
> PowerShell 2.0 to run the `Enable-PSRemoting` and `Disable-PSRemoting` cmdlets. The commands
> might appear to succeed, but the remoting is not configured correctly. Remote commands and later
> attempts to enable and disable remoting, are likely to fail.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Configure a computer to receive remote commands

This command configures the computer to receive remote commands.

```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting
```

### Example 2: Configure a computer to receive remote commands without a confirmation prompt

This command configures the computer to receive remote commands.
The **Force** parameter suppresses the user prompts.

```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting -Force
```

### Example 3: Allow remote access on clients

This example shows how to allow remote access from public networks on client versions of the Windows
operating system. The name of the firewall rule can be different for different versions of Windows.
Use `Get-NetFirewallRule` to see a list of rules. Before enabling the firewall rule, view the
security settings in the rule to verify that the configuration is appropriate for your environment.

```powershell
Get-NetFirewallRule -Name 'WINRM*' | Select-Object Name
```

```Output
Name
----
WINRM-HTTP-In-TCP-NoScope
WINRM-HTTP-In-TCP
WINRM-HTTP-Compat-In-TCP-NoScope
WINRM-HTTP-Compat-In-TCP
```

```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting -SkipNetworkProfileCheck -Force
Set-NetFirewallRule -Name 'WINRM-HTTP-In-TCP' -RemoteAddress Any
```

By default, `Enable-PSRemoting` creates network rules that allow remote access from private and
domain networks. The command uses the **SkipNetworkProfileCheck** parameter to allow remote access
from public networks in the same local subnet. The command specifies the **Force** parameter to
suppress confirmation messages.

The **SkipNetworkProfileCheck** parameter does not affect server versions of the Windows operating
system, which allow remote access from public networks in the same local subnet by default.

The `Set-NetFirewallRule` cmdlet in the **NetSecurity** module adds a firewall rule that allows
remote access from public networks from any remote location. This includes locations in different
subnets.

> [!NOTE]
> The name of the firewall rule can be different depending on the version of Windows. Use the
> `Get-NetFirewallRule` cmdlet to list the names of the rules on your system.

## PARAMETERS

### -Confirm

Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force

Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SkipNetworkProfileCheck

Indicates that this cmdlet enables remoting on client versions of the Windows operating system when
the computer is on a public network. This parameter enables a firewall rule for public networks
that allows remote access only from computers in the same local subnet.

This parameter does not affect server versions of the Windows operating system, which, by default,
have a local subnet firewall rule for public networks. If the local subnet firewall rule is
disabled on a server version, `Enable-PSRemoting` re-enables it, regardless of the value of this
parameter.

To remove the local subnet restriction and enable remote access from all locations on public
networks, use the `Set-NetFirewallRule` cmdlet in the **NetSecurity** module.

This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable,
-InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose,
-WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

You cannot pipe input to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### System.String

This cmdlet returns strings that describe its results.

## NOTES

In PowerShell 3.0, `Enable-PSRemoting` creates the following firewall exceptions for
WS-Management communications.

On server versions of the Windows operating system, `Enable-PSRemoting` creates firewall rules
for private and domain networks that allow remote access, and creates a firewall rule for public
networks that allows remote access only from computers in the same local subnet.

On client versions of the Windows operating system, `Enable-PSRemoting` in PowerShell 3.0 creates
firewall rules for private and domain networks that allow unrestricted remote access. To create a
firewall rule for public networks that allows remote access from the same local subnet, use the
**SkipNetworkProfileCheck** parameter.

On client or server versions of the Windows operating system, to create a firewall rule for public
networks that removes the local subnet restriction and allows remote access , use the
`Set-NetFirewallRule` cmdlet in the NetSecurity module to run the following command:
`Set-NetFirewallRule -Name "WINRM-HTTP-In-TCP-PUBLIC" -RemoteAddress Any`

In PowerShell 2.0, `Enable-PSRemoting` creates the following firewall exceptions for WS-Management
communications.

On server versions of the Windows operating system, it creates firewall rules for all networks that
allow remote access.

On client versions of the Windows operating system, `Enable-PSRemoting` in PowerShell 2.0
creates a firewall exception only for domain and private network locations. To minimize security
risks, `Enable-PSRemoting` does not create a firewall rule for public networks on client versions
of Windows. When the current network location is public, `Enable-PSRemoting` returns the following
message: Unable to check the status of the firewall.

Starting in PowerShell 3.0, `Enable-PSRemoting` enables all session configurations by setting the
value of the **Enabled** property of all session configurations to `$True`.

In PowerShell 2.0, `Enable-PSRemoting` removes the **Deny_All** setting from the security
descriptor of session configurations. In PowerShell 3.0, `Enable-PSRemoting` removes the
**Deny_All** and **Network_Deny_All** settings. This provides remote access to session
configurations that were reserved for local use.
