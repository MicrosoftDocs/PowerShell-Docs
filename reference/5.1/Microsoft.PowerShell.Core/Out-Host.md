# Out-Host

## SYNOPSIS
Sends output to the command line.

## SYNTAX

### All

```
Out-Host [-Paging] [-InputObject <PSObject>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Out-Host` cmdlet sends output to the PowerShell host for display. The host displays the output
at the command line. Because `Out-Host` is the default, you don't have to specify it unless you want
to use its parameters.

`Out-Host` is automatically appended to every command that is executed. It passes the output of the
pipeline to the host executing the command. `Out-Host` ignores ANSI escape sequences. The escape
sequences are handled by the host. `Out-Host` passes ANSI escape sequences to the host without
trying to interpret or change them.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Display output one page at a time

This example displays the system processes one page at a time.

```powershell
Get-Process | Out-Host -Paging
```

```Output
NPM(K)    PM(M)      WS(M)     CPU(s)      Id  SI ProcessName
 ------    -----      -----     ------      --  -- -----------
     30    24.12      36.95      15.86   21004  14 ApplicationFrameHost
     55    24.33      60.48      10.80   12904  14 BCompare
<SPACE> next page; <CR> next line; Q quit
      9     4.71       8.94       0.00   16864  14 explorer
<SPACE> next page; <CR> next line; Q quit
```

`Get-Process` gets the system processes and sends the objects down the pipeline. `Out-Host` uses the
**Paging** parameter to display one page of data at a time.

### Example 2: Use a variable as input

This example uses objects stored in a variable as the input for `Out-Host`.

```powershell
$io = Get-History
Out-Host -InputObject $io
```

`Get-History` gets the PowerShell session's history, and stores the objects in the `$io` variable.
`Out-Host` uses the **InputObject** parameter to specify the `$io` variable and displays the
history.

## PARAMETERS

### -InputObject

Specifies the objects that are written to the console. Enter a variable that contains the objects,
or type a command or expression that gets the objects.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.PSObject
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Paging

Indicates that `Out-Host` displays one page of output at a time, and waits for user input before the
remaining pages are displayed. By default, all the output is displayed on a single page. The page
size is determined by the characteristics of the host.

Press the <kbd>Space</kbd> bar to display the next page of output or the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to
view the next line of output. Press <kbd>Q</kbd> to quit.

**Paging** is similar to the **more** command.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Paging** parameter isn't supported by the PowerShell ISE host.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable,
-InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose,
-WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### System.Management.Automation.PSObject

You can send objects down the pipeline to `Out-Host`.

## OUTPUTS

### None

`Out-Host` doesn't generate any output. It sends objects to the host for display.

## NOTES

The **Paging** parameter isn't supported by all PowerShell hosts. For example, if you use the
**Paging** parameter in the PowerShell ISE, the following error is displayed:
`out-lineoutput : The method or operation is not implemented.`

The cmdlets that contain the **Out** verb, `Out-`, don't format objects. They render objects and
send them to the specified display destination. If you send an unformatted object to an `Out-`
cmdlet, the cmdlet sends it to a formatting cmdlet before rendering it.

The `Out-` cmdlets don't have parameters for names or file paths. To send data to an `Out-` cmdlet,
use the pipeline to send a PowerShell command's output to the cmdlet. Or, you can store data in a
variable and use the **InputObject** parameter to pass the data to the cmdlet.

`Out-Host` sends data, but it doesn't produce any output objects. If you pipeline the output of
`Out-Host` to the `Get-Member` cmdlet, `Get-Member` reports that no objects have been specified.
