### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Gets the Windows PowerShell snap-ins on the computer.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core
notes: |-
  Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, the core commands that are installed with Windows PowerShell are
  packaged in modules. In Windows PowerShell 2.0, and in host programs that create older-style
  sessions in later versions of Windows PowerShell, the core commands are packaged in snap-ins
  (**PSSnapin**). The exception is **Microsoft.PowerShell.Core**, which is always a snap-in. Also,
  remote sessions, such as those started by the `New-PSSession` cmdlet, are older-style sessions that
  include core snap-ins.

   For information about the **CreateDefault2** method that creates newer-style sessions with core
   modules, see
   [CreateDefault2 Method](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.runspaces.initialsessionstate.createdefault2#System_Management_Automation_Runspaces_InitialSessionState_CreateDefault2).

    that are installed with Windows PowerShell or Windows PowerShell snap-in dynamic-link libraries
    (DLLs) that have not yet been registered on the system.

    Indicates that this cmdlet gets the Windows PowerShell snap-ins that have been registered on the
    system even if they have not yet been added to the session.

    The snap-ins that are installed with Windows PowerShell do not appear in this list.

    Without this parameter, `Get-PSSnapin` gets the Windows PowerShell snap-ins that have been added to
    the session.

description: |-
  The `Get-PSSnapin` cmdlet gets the Windows PowerShell snap-ins that have been added to the current
  session or that have been registered on the system. This cmdlet lists the snap-ins in the order in
  which they are detected.

  `Get-PSSnapin` gets only registered snap-ins. To register a Windows PowerShell snap-in, use the
  InstallUtil tool included with the Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0. For more information, see
  [How to Register Cmdlets, Providers, and Host Applications](/previous-versions//ms714644(v=vs.85)).

  Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, the core commands that are included in Windows PowerShell are
  packaged in modules. The exception is **Microsoft.PowerShell.Core**, which is a snap-in (PSSnapin).
  By default, only the **Microsoft.PowerShell.Core** snap-in is added to the session. Modules are
  imported automatically on first use and you can use the `Import-Module` cmdlet to import them.
