    The first command creates an array that contains first and last names.

    The second command formats the names according to the example.
    It puts the surname first in the output, followed by an initial.

  code: |-
    $composers = @("Johann Sebastian Bach", "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart", "Frederic Francois Chopin", "Johannes Brahms")
    $composers | Convert-String -Example "first middle last=last, first"

    Bach, Johann
    Mozart, Wolfgang
    Chopin, Frederic
    Brahms, Johannes
  description: |-
    The first command creates an array that contains first, middle and last names.
    Note that the last entry has no middle name.

    The second command formats the names according to the example.
    It puts the last name first in the output, followed by the first name.
    All middle names removed; entry without middle name is handled correctly.

  code: |-
    $composers = @("Johann Sebastian Bach", "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart", "Frederic Francois Chopin", "Johannes Brahms")
    $composers | Convert-String -Example "first middle last=middle, first"

    Sebastian, Johann
    Amadeus, Wolfgang
    Francois, Frederic
  description: |-
    The first command creates an array that contains first, middle and last names.
    Note that the last entry has no middle name.

    The second command formats the names according to the example.
    It puts the **middle name** first in the output, followed by the first name.
    The last entry in **$Composers** is skipped, because it doesn't match the
    sample pattern: it has no middle name.

  code: |-
    $composers = @("Antonio Vivaldi", "Richard Wagner ", "Franz Schubert", "Johannes Brahms ")
    $composers | Convert-String -Example "Patti Fuller = Fuller, P."

    Wagner, R.
     Brahms, J.
  description: |-
    The first command creates an array of first and last names.
    Note that second and fourth items have an extra trailing space,
    after the last name.

    The second command converts all strings that match the sample pattern:
    _word, space, word, and final trailing space_, all of this
    before the equal sign.
    Also, note the leading space in the output.

    **$ExamplePatterns** defines different expected patterns in the data,
    through examples.

    The first pattern, `@{before='"Hello","World"'; after='World: Hello'}`,
    reads as follows:
    _expect strings where a word comes enclosed in double quotes, then a comma,_
    _and then the second, and last, word enclosed in quotes;_
    _with no spaces in the string. On the output: place second word first,_
    _without quotes, then a single space, and then the first word, without quotes._

    The second pattern, `@{before='"Hello","1"'; after='1: Hello'}`,
    reads as follows:
    _expect strings where a word comes enclosed in double quotes, then a comma,_
    _and then a number enclosed in quotes;_
    _with no spaces in the string. On the output: place the number first,_
    _without quotes, then a single space, and then the word, without quotes._

    The third pattern, `@{before='"Hello-World","22"'; after='22: Hello-World'}`,
    reads as follows:
    _expect strings where two words with a hyphen in between come enclosed in_
    _double quotes, then a comma, and then a number enclosed in quotes;_
    _with no spaces between the comma and the third double quote._
    _On the output: place the number first, without quotes, then a single space,_
    _and then the hyphenated words, without quotes._

    The fourth, and final, pattern,
    `@{before='"hello world","333"'; after='333: hello world'}`,
    reads as follows:
    _expect strings where two words with a space in between come enclosed in_
    _double quotes, then a comma, and then a number enclosed in quotes;_
    _with no spaces between the comma and the third double quote._
    _On the output: place the number first, without quotes, then a single space,_
    _and then the words with the space in between, without quotes._

    The first command gets all processes by using the Get-Process cmdlet.
    The command passes them to the Select-Object cmdlet, which selects the process
    name and process ID. At the end of the pipeline, the command converts the
    output to comma separated values, without type information, by using the
    ConvertTo-Csv cmdlet.
    The command stores the results in the **$Processes** variable.
    **$Processes** now contains process names and PID.

    The second command specifies an example variable that changes the order of the
    input items.
    The command coverts each string in **$Processes**.

    >**Note**
    >The fourth pattern implicitly says that two or more words
    >separated by spaces are matched.
    >
    >Without the fourth pattern, only the first word of the string enclosed in
    >double quotes is matched.

    Specifies a list of examples of the target format.
    Specify pairs separated by the equal (=) sign,
    with the source pattern on the left
    and the target pattern on the right, as in the following examples:

    * `-Example "Hello World=World, Hello"`
    * `-Example "Hello World=World: Hello",'"Hello","1"=1: Hello'`

    >**Note**
    >The second example uses a list of patterns

    Alternatively, specify a list of hash tables that contain **Before** and
    **After** properties.

    * `-Example @{before='"Hello","World"'; after='World: Hello'}, @{before='"Hello","1"'; after='1: Hello'}`

    >**Caution**
    >Avoid using spaces around the equal sign,
    >as they are treated as part of the pattern.
