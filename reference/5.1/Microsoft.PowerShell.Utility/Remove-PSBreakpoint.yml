examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Remove all breakpoints'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-PSBreakpoint | Remove-PSBreakpoint
  description: |-
    This command deletes all of the breakpoints in the current console.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Remove a specified breakpoint'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $B = Set-PSBreakpoint -Script "sample.ps1" -Variable "Name"
    PS C:\> $B | Remove-PSBreakpoint
  description: |-
    This command deletes a breakpoint.

    The first command uses the Set-PSBreakpoint cmdlet to create a breakpoint on the Name variable in the Sample.ps1 script.
    Then, it saves the breakpoint object in the $B variable.

    The second command uses the **Remove-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet to delete the new breakpoint.
    It uses a pipeline operator (|) to send the breakpoint object in the $B variable to the **Remove-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet.

    As a result of this command, if you run the script, it runs to completion without stopping.
    Also, the **Get-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet does not return this breakpoint.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 3: Remove a breakpoint by ID'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Remove-PSBreakpoint -Id 2
  description: |-
    This command deletes the breakpoint with breakpoint ID 2.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 4: Use a function to remove all breakpoints'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> function del-psb { get-psbreakpoint | remove-psbreakpoint }
  description: |-
    This simple function deletes all of the breakpoints in the current console.
    It uses the Get-PSBreakpoint cmdlet to get the breakpoints.
    Then, it uses a pipeline operator (|) to send the breakpoints to the **Remove-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet, which deletes them.

    As a result, you can type `del-psb` instead of the longer command.

    To save the function, add it to your Windows PowerShell profile.

  The **Remove-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet deletes a breakpoint.
  Enter a breakpoint object or a breakpoint ID.

  When you remove a breakpoint, the breakpoint object is no longer available or functional.
  If you have saved a breakpoint object in a variable, the reference still exists, but the breakpoint does not function.

  **Remove-PSBreakpoint** is one of several cmdlets designed for debugging Windows PowerShell scripts.
  For more information about the Windows PowerShell debugger, see about_Debuggers.
