# Get-Date

## SYNOPSIS
Gets the current date and time.

## SYNTAX

### net (Default)
```
Get-Date [[-Date] <DateTime>] [-Year <Int32>] [-Month <Int32>] [-Day <Int32>] [-Hour <Int32>] [-Minute <Int32>]
 [-Second <Int32>] [-Millisecond <Int32>] [-DisplayHint <DisplayHintType>] [-Format <String>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

### UFormat
```
Get-Date [[-Date] <DateTime>] [-Year <Int32>] [-Month <Int32>] [-Day <Int32>] [-Hour <Int32>] [-Minute <Int32>]
 [-Second <Int32>] [-Millisecond <Int32>] [-DisplayHint <DisplayHintType>] [-UFormat <String>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The `Get-Date` cmdlet gets a **DateTime** object that represents the current date or a date that you specify.
It can format the date and time in several Windows and UNIX formats.
You can use `Get-Date` to generate a date or time character string, and then send the string to other cmdlets or programs.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1

```powershell
Get-Date -DisplayHint Date
```

```
Tuesday, June 13, 2006
```

This command gets a **DateTime** object, but it displays only the date.
It uses the `-DisplayHint` parameter to indicate that only the date is to be displayed.

### Example 2

```powershell
Get-Date -Format g
```

```
6/13/2006 12:43 PM
```

This command gets the current date and time and formats it in short-date and short-time format.
It uses the .NET Framework "`g`" format specifier (General \[short date and short time\]) to specify the format.

### Example 3

```powershell
Get-Date -UFormat "%Y / %m / %d / %A / %Z"
```

```
2006 / 06 / 13 / Tuesday / -07
```

This command gets the current date and time and formats it as specified by the command.
In this case, the format includes the full year (`%Y`), the two-digit numeric month (`%m`), the date (`%d`), the full day of the week (`%A`), and the offset from UTC ("Zulu").

### Example 4

```powershell
(Get-Date -Year 2000 -Month 12 -Day 31).DayOfYear
```

```
366
```

This command displays the day of the year for the current date.
For example, December 31 is the 365th day of 2006, but it is the 366th day of 2000.

### Example 5
```powershell
$a = Get-Date
$a.IsDaylightSavingTime()
```

```
True
```

These commands tell you whether the current date and time are adjusted for daylight savings time in the current locale.

The first command creates a variable named $a and then assigns the object retrieved by `Get-Date` to the $a variable.
Then, it uses the **IsDaylightSavingTime** method on the object in `$a`.

To see the properties and methods of the **DateTime** object, type: `Get-Date | Get-Member`

### Example 6

```powershell
$a = Get-Date
$a.ToUniversalTime()
```

```
Tuesday, June 13, 2006 8:09:19 PM
```

These commands convert the current date and time to UTC time.

The first command creates a variable named $a and then assigns the object retrieved by `Get-Date` to the $a variable.
Then, it uses the **ToUniversalTime** method on the object in $a.

### Example 7

```powershell
$a = Get-WmiObject Win32_Bios -Computer Server01
$a | Format-List -Property Name, @{Label="BIOS Age";Expression={(Get-Date) - $_.ConvertToDateTime($_.ReleaseDate)}}
```

```
Name     : Default System BIOS
BIOS Age : 1345.17:31:07.1091047
```

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) uses a different date-time object than the .NET Framework date-time object that `Get-Date` returns.
To use date-time information from WMI in a command with date-time information from `Get-Date`, you have to use the **ConvertToDateTime** method to convert WMI **CIM_DATETIME** objects to .NET Framework **DateTime** objects.

The commands in this example display the name and age of the BIOS on a remote computer, Server01.

The first command uses the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to get an instance of the **Win32_BIOS** class on Server01 and then stores it in the `$a` variable.

The second command uses the pipeline operator (`|`) to send the WMI object stored in $a to the Format-List cmdlet.
The `-Property` parameter of `Format-List` specifies two properties to display in the list, "Name" and "BIOS Age".
The "BIOS Age" property is specified in a hash table.
The table includes the **Label** key, which specifies the name of the property, and the **Expression** key, which contains the expression that calculates the BIOS age.
The expression uses the **ConvertToDateTime** method to convert each instance of ReleaseDate to a .NET Framework DateTime object.
Then, the value is subtracted from the value of the `Get-Date` cmdlet, which, without parameters, gets the current date.

The backtick character (`` ` ``) is the line continuation character in Windows PowerShell.

### Example 8

```powershell
Get-Date
```

```
Tuesday, June 13, 2006 12:43:42 PM
```

This command gets a **DateTime** object and displays the current date and time in the long date and long time formats for the system locale, as though you typed "`Get-Date -Format F`".

### Example 9

```powershell
Get-Date
```

```
Tuesday, September 26, 2006 11:25:31 AM
```

```powershell
(Get-Date).ToString()
```

```
9/26/2006 11:25:31 AM
```

```powershell
Get-Date | Add-Content Test.txt

# Adds 9/26/2006 11:25:31 AM
```

```powershell
Get-Date -Format F | Add-Content Test.txt

# Adds Tuesday, September 26, 2006 11:25:31 AM
```

These commands demonstrate how to use `Get-Date` with `Add-Content` and other cmdlets that convert the **DateTime** object that `Get-Date` generates to a string.

The first command shows that the default display from a "`Get-Date`" command is in long-date and long-time format.

The second command shows that the default display from the `ToString()` method of the **DateTime** object is in short-date and short-time format.

The third command uses a pipeline operator to send the **DateTime** object to the `Add-Content` cmdlet, which adds the content to the Test.txt file.
Because `Add-Content` uses the ToString() method of the **DateTime** object, the date that is added is in short-date and short-time format.

The fourth command uses the `-Format` parameter of `Get-Date` to specify the format.
When you use the `-Format` or `-UFormat` parameters, `Get-Date` generates a string, not a **DateTime** object.
Then, when you send the string to `Add-Content`, it adds the string to the Test.txt file without changing it.

### Example 10
```powershell
Get-Date -Format o
```

```
2012-03-08T10:55:55.6083839-08:00
```

```powershell
$timestamp = Get-Date -Format o | foreach {$_ -replace ":", "."}
```

```powershell
mkdir C:\ps-test\$timestamp
```

```
Directory: C:\ps-test

Mode                LastWriteTime     Length Name
----                -------------     ------ ----
d----          3/8/2012  11:01 AM            2012-03-08T11.00.24.4192623-08.00
```

The first command uses the `-Format` parameter with a value of "`o`" to generate a timestamp string.

The second command prepares the timestamp to be used in a directory name. The command replaces the colon characters (`:`) in the string with dots (`.`) and saves the result in the `$timestamp` variable. Replacing the colons prevents the characters that precede each colon from being interpreted as a drive name.

The third command uses the Mkdir function to create a directory with the name in the `$timestamp` variable.
This example shows how to use the `Get-Date` cmdlet to create a timestamp and how to use the timestamp in or as part of a directory name.

## PARAMETERS

### -Date
Specifies a date and time.
By default, `Get-Date` gets the current system date and time.

Type the date in a format that is standard for the system locale, such as dd-MM-yyyy (German \[Germany\]) or MM/dd/yyyy (English \[United States\]).

```yaml
Type: DateTime
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: LastWriteTime

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: Current date
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Day
Specifies the day of the month that is displayed.
Enter a value from 1 to 31.
The default is the current day.

If you specify a value that is greater than the number of days in the month, Windows PowerShell adds the number of days to the month and displays the result.
For example, "`Get-Date -Month 2 -Day 31`" displays "March 3", not "February 31".

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DisplayHint
Determines which elements of the date and time are displayed.

Valid values are:

- **Date**: displays only the date
- **Time**: displays only the time
- **DateTime**: displays the date and time

**DateTime** is the default.
This parameter does not affect the **DateTime** object that `Get-Date` gets.

```yaml
Type: DisplayHintType
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: Date, Time, DateTime

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Format
Displays the date and time in the Microsoft .NET Framework format indicated by the format specifier.
Enter a format specifier.
For a list of available format specifiers, see [DateTimeFormatInfo Class](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=143638) in the MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network) library.

When you use the `-Format` parameter, Windows PowerShell gets only the properties of the **DateTime** object that it needs to display the date in the format that you specify.
As a result, some of the properties and methods of **DateTime** objects might not be available.

Starting in Windows PowerShell 5.0, you can use the following additional formats as values for the `-Format` parameter.

- FileDate. A file or path-friendly representation of the current date in local time. It is in the form of yyyyMMdd (case-sensitive, using a 4-digit year, 2-digit month, and 2-digit day). An example of results when you use this format is 20150302.

- FileDateUniversal. A file or path-friendly representation of the current date in universal time (UTC). It is in the form of yyyyMMddZ (case-sensitive, using a 4-digit year, 2-digit month, 2-digit day, and the letter "Z" as the UTC indicator). An example of results when you use this format is 20150302Z.

- FileDateTime. A file or path-friendly representation of the current date and time in local time, in 24-hour format. It is in the form of yyyyMMddTHHmmssffff (case-sensitive, using a 4-digit year, 2-digit month, 2-digit day, the letter "T" as a time separator, 2-digit hour, 2-digit minute, 2-digit second, and 4-digit millisecond). An example of results when you use this format is 20150302T1240514987.

- FileDateTimeUniversal. A file or path-friendly representation of the current date and time in universal time (UTC), in 24-hour format. It is in the form of yyyyMMddTHHmmssffffZ (case-sensitive, using a 4-digit year, 2-digit month, 2-digit day, the letter "T" as a time separator, 2-digit hour, 2-digit minute, 2-digit second, 4-digit millisecond, and the letter "Z" as the UTC indicator). An example of results when you use this format is 20150302T0840539947Z.

```

### -UFormat
Displays the date and time in UNIX format.
For a list of the format specifiers, see the Notes section.

When you use the `-UFormat` parameter, Windows PowerShell gets only the properties of the **DateTime** object that it needs to display the date in the format that you specify.
As a result, some of the properties and methods of **DateTime** objects might not be available.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: UFormat
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### None
You cannot pipe input to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### System.DateTime or System.String
When you use the `-Format` or `-UFormat` parameters, `Get-Date` returns a string.
Otherwise, it returns a **DateTime** object.

## NOTES
* By default, the date-time is displayed in long-date and long-time formats for the system locale.

  When you pipe a date to cmdlets that expect string input, such as the Add-Content cmdlet, Windows PowerShell converts the **DateTime** object to a string before adding it to the file. The default `ToString()` format is short date and long time. To specify an alternate format, use the `-Format` or `-UFormat` parameters of `Get-Date`.

  * Uformat Values:

    The following are the values of the `-UFormat` parameter. The format for the command is:
