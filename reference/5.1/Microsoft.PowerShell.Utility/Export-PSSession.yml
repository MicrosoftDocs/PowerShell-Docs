### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Exports commands from another session and saves them in a PowerShell module.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
notes: |-
  `Export-PSSession` relies on the PowerShell remoting infrastructure. To use this cmdlet, the
  computer must be configured for remoting. For more information, see
  [about_Remote_Requirements](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Remote_Requirements.md).

  You cannot use `Export-PSSession` to export a PowerShell provider.

  Exported commands run implicitly in the PSSession from which they were exported. The details of
  running the commands remotely are handled entirely by PowerShell. You can run the exported commands
  just as you would run local commands.

  `Export-ModuleMember` captures and saves information about the PSSession in the module that it
  exports. If the PSSession from which the commands were exported is closed when you import the
  module, and there are no active PSSessions to the same computer, the commands in the module attempt
  to recreate the PSSession. If attempts to recreate the PSSession fail, the exported commands will
  not run.

  The session information that `Export-ModuleMember` captures and saves in the module does not
  include session options, such as those that you specify in the `$PSSessionOption` preference
  variable or by using the **SessionOption** parameter of the `New-PSSession`, `Enter-PSSession`, or
  `Invoke-Command` cmdlets. If the original PSSession is closed when you import the module, the
  module will use another PSSession to the same computer, if one is available. To enable the imported
  commands to run in a correctly configured session, create a PSSession with the options that you
  want before you import the module.

  To find the commands to export, `Export-PSSession` uses the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet to run a
  `Get-Command` command in the PSSession. To get and save formatting data for the commands, it uses
  the `Get-FormatData` and `Export-FormatData` cmdlets. You might see error messages from
  `Invoke-Command`, `Get-Command`, `Get-FormatData`, and `Export-FormatData` when you run an
  `Export-PSSession` command. Also, `Export-PSSession` cannot export commands from a session that
  does not include the `Get-Command`, `Get-FormatData`, `Select-Object`, and `Get-Help` cmdlets.

  `Export-PSSession` uses the `Write-Progress` cmdlet to display the progress of the command. You
  might see the progress bar while the command is running.

  Exported commands have the same limitations as other remote commands, including the inability to
  start a program with a user interface, such as Notepad.

  Because PowerShell profiles are not run in PSSessions, the commands that a profile adds to a
  session are not available to `Export-PSSession`. To export commands from a profile, use an
  `Invoke-Command` command to run the profile in the PSSession manually before exporting commands.

  The module that `Export-PSSession` creates might include a formatting file, even if the command
  does not import formatting data. If the command does not import formatting data, any formatting
  files that are created will not contain formatting data.

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Export commands from a PSSession'
  code: |-
    $S = New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01
    Export-PSSession -Session $S -OutputModule Server01
  description: |-
    The `New-PSSession` command creates a PSSession on the Server01 computer. The PSSession is stored
    in the `$S` variable. The `Export-PSSession` command exports the `$S` variable's commands and
    formatting data into the Server01 module.
  summary: |+
    This example creates a new PSSession from the local computer to the Server01 computer. All of the
    commands, except those that exist in the current session, are exported to the module named Server01
    on the local computer. The export includes the formatting data for the commands.

- title: 'Example 2: Export the Get and Set commands'
  code: |-
    $S = New-PSSession -ConnectionUri https://exchange.microsoft.com/mailbox -Credential exchangeadmin01@hotmail.com -Authentication Negotiate
    Export-PSSession -Session $S -Module exch* -CommandName Get-*, Set-* -FormatTypeName * -OutputModule $PSHOME\Modules\Exchange -Encoding ASCII
  description: |-
    These commands export the `Get` and `Set` commands from a Microsoft Exchange Server snap-in on a
    remote computer to an Exchange module in the `$PSHOME\Modules` directory on the local computer.
    Placing the module in the `$PSHOME\Modules` directory makes it accessible to all users of the
    computer.
  summary: |+
    This example exports all of the `Get` and `Set` commands from a server.

- title: 'Example 3: Export commands from a remote computer'
  code: |-
    $S = New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01 -Credential Server01\User01
    Export-PSSession -Session $S -OutputModule TestCmdlets -Type Cmdlet -CommandName *test* -FormatTypeName *
    Remove-PSSession $S
    Import-Module TestCmdlets
    Get-Help Test*
    Test-Files
  description: |-
    The `New-PSSession` command creates a PSSession on the Server01 computer and saves it in the `$S`
    variable. The `Export-PSSession` command exports the cmdlets whose names begin with Test from the
    PSSession in `$S` to the TestCmdlets module on the local computer.

    The `Remove-PSSession` cmdlet deletes the PSSession in `$S` from the current session. This command
    shows that the PSSession need not be active to use the commands that were imported from the
    session. The `Import-Module` cmdlet adds the cmdlets in the TestCmdlets module to the current
    session. The command can be run in any session at any time.

    The `Get-Help` cmdlet gets help for cmdlets whose names begin with Test. After the commands in a
    module are added to the current session, you can use the `Get-Help` and `Get-Command` cmdlets to
    learn about the imported commands. The `Test-Files` cmdlet was exported from the Server01 computer
    and added to the session. The `Test-Files` cmdlet runs in a remote session on the computer from
    which the command was imported. PowerShell creates a session from information that is stored in the
    TestCmdlets module.
  summary: |+
    This example exports cmdlets from a PSSession on a remote computer and saves them in a module on
    the local computer. The cmdlets from the module are added to the current session so that they can
    be used.

- title: 'Example 4: Export and clobber commands in the current session'
  code: |-
    Export-PSSession -Session $S -AllowClobber -OutputModule AllCommands
  description: |-
    This `Export-PSSession` command exports all commands and all formatting data from the PSSession in
    the `$S` variable into the current session. The **AllowClobber** parameter includes commands with
    the same names as commands in the current session.
  summary: |+
    This example exports commands that are stored in a variable into the current session.

- title: 'Example 5: Export commands from a closed PSSession'
  code: |-
    $Options = New-PSSessionOption -NoMachineProfile
    $S = New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01 -SessionOption $Options
    Export-PSSession -Session $S -OutputModule Server01
    Remove-PSSession $S
    New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01 -SessionOption $Options
    Import-Module Server01
  description: |-
    The `New-PSSessionOption` cmdlet creates a **PSSessionOption** object, and it saves the object in
    the `$Options` variable. The `New-PSSession` command creates a PSSession on the Server01 computer.
    The **SessionOption** parameter uses the object stored in `$Options`. The session is stored in the
    `$S` variable.

    The `Export-PSSession` cmdlet exports commands from the PSSession in `$S` to the Server01 module.
    The `Remove-PSSession` cmdlet deletes the PSSession in the `$S` variable.

    The `New-PSSession` cmdlet creates a new PSSession that connects to the Server01 computer. The
    **SessionOption** parameter uses the object stored in `$Options`. The `Import-Module` cmdlet
    imports the commands from the Server01 module. The commands in the module are run in the PSSession
    on the Server01 computer.
  summary: |+
    This example shows how to run the exported commands with special options when the PSSession that
    created the exported commands is closed.

    If the original remote session is closed when a module is imported, the module will use any open
    remote session that connects to the originating computer. If there is no current session to the
    originating computer, the module will reestablish a session.

    To run exported commands with special options in a remote session, you must create a remote session
    with those options before you import the module. Use the `New-PSSession` cmdlet with the
    **SessionOption** parameter

  name: AllowClobber
  description: |+
    Exports the specified commands, even if they have the same names as commands in the current
    session.

    If you export a command with the same name as a command in the current session, the exported
    command hides or replaces the original commands. For more information, see
    [about_Command_Precedence](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Command_Precedence.md).

  name: ArgumentList
  description: |+
    Exports the variant of the command that results from using the specified arguments (parameter
    values).

    For example, to export the variant of the `Get-Item` command in the certificate (Cert:) drive in
    the PSSession in `$S`, type `Export-PSSession -Session $S -Command Get-Item -ArgumentList cert:`.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Certificate
  description: |+
    Specifies the client certificate that is used to sign the format files (*.Format.ps1xml) or script
    module files (.psm1) in the module that `Export-PSSession` creates. Enter a variable that contains
    a certificate or a command or expression that gets the certificate.

    To find a certificate, use the `Get-PfxCertificate` cmdlet or use the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet in the
    Certificate (Cert:) drive. If the certificate is not valid or does not have sufficient authority,
    the command fails.

  name: CommandName
  description: |+
    Exports only the commands with the specified names or name patterns. Wildcards are permitted. Use
    **CommandName** or its alias, **Name**.

    By default, `Export-PSSession` exports all commands from the PSSession except for commands that
    have the same names as commands in the current session. This prevents commands from being hidden or
    replaced by commands in the current session. To export all commands, even those that hide or
    replace other commands, use the **AllowClobber** parameter.

    If you use the **CommandName** parameter, the formatting files for the commands are not exported
    unless you use the **FormatTypeName** parameter. Similarly, if you use the **FormatTypeName**
    parameter, no commands are exported unless you use the **CommandName** parameter.

  defaultValue: All commands in the session.

  name: FormatTypeName
  description: |+
    Exports formatting instructions only for the specified Microsoft .NET Framework types. Enter the
    type names. By default, `Export-PSSession` exports formatting instructions for all .NET Framework
    types that are not in the **System.Management.Automation** namespace.

    The value of this parameter must be the name of a type that is returned by a `Get-FormatData`
    command in the session from which the commands are being imported. To get all of the formatting
    data in the remote session, type `*`.

    If you use the **FormatTypeName** parameter, no commands are exported unless you use the
    **CommandName** parameter.

    If you use the **CommandName** parameter, the formatting files for the commands are not exported
    unless you use the **FormatTypeName** parameter.

    Specifies modules with names that are specified in the form of **ModuleSpecification** objects. See
    the Remarks section of
    [ModuleSpecification Constructor (Hashtable)](/dotnet/api/microsoft.powershell.commands.modulespecification.-ctor#Microsoft_PowerShell_Commands_ModuleSpecification__ctor_System_Collections_Hashtable_).

    For example, the **FullyQualifiedModule** parameter accepts a module name that is specified in
    either of these formats:

    - `@{ModuleName = "modulename"; ModuleVersion = "version_number"}`
    - `@{ModuleName = "modulename"; ModuleVersion = "version_number"; Guid = "GUID"}`

    **ModuleName** and **ModuleVersion** are required, but **Guid** is optional. You cannot specify the
    **FullyQualifiedModule** parameter in the same command as a **Module** parameter. the two
    parameters are mutually exclusive.

name: Export-PSSession
description: |-
  The `Export-PSSession` cmdlet gets cmdlets, functions, aliases, and other command types from
  another PowerShell session (PSSession) on a local or remote computer and saves them in a PowerShell
  module. To add the commands from the module to the current session, use the `Import-Module` cmdlet.

  Unlike `Import-PSSession`, which imports commands from another PSSession into the current session,
  `Export-PSSession` saves the commands in a module. The commands are not imported into the current
  session.

  To export commands, use the `New-PSSession` cmdlet to create a PSSession that has the commands that
  you want to export. Then use the `Export-PSSession` cmdlet to export the commands.

  To prevent command name conflicts, the default for `Export-PSSession` is to export all commands,
  except for commands that exist in the current session. You can use the **CommandName** parameter to
  specify the commands to export.

  The `Export-PSSession` cmdlet uses the implicit remoting feature of PowerShell. When you import
  commands into the current session, they run implicitly in the original session or in a similar
  session on the originating computer.
