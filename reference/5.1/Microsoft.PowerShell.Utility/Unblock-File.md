# Unblock-File

## SYNOPSIS
Unblocks files that were downloaded from the Internet.

## SYNTAX

### ByPath (Default)
```
Unblock-File [-Path] <String[]> [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### ByLiteralPath
```
Unblock-File -LiteralPath <String[]> [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Unblock-File** cmdlet lets you open files that were downloaded from the Internet.
It unblocks Windows PowerShell script files that were downloaded from the Internet so you can run them, even when the Windows PowerShell execution policy is **RemoteSigned**.
By default, these files are blocked to protect the computer from untrusted files.

Before using the **Unblock-File** cmdlet, review the file and its source and verify that it is safe to open.

Internally, the **Unblock-File** cmdlet removes the Zone.Identifier alternate data stream, which has a value of "3" to indicate that it was downloaded from the Internet.

For more information about Windows PowerShell execution policies, see about_Execution_Policies (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170).

This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Unblock a file
```
PS C:\> Unblock-File -Path C:\Users\User01\Documents\Downloads\PowerShellTips.chm
```

This command unblocks the PowerShellTips.chm file.

### Example 2: Unblock multiple files
```
PS C:\> dir C:\Downloads\*PowerShell* | Unblock-File
```

This command unblocks all of the files in the C:\Downloads directory whose names include "PowerShell".
Do not run a command like this one until you have verified that all files are safe.

### Example 3: Find and unblock scripts
```
The first command uses the *Stream* parameter of the Get-Item cmdlet get files with the Zone.Identifier stream.Although you could pipe the output directly to the **Unblock-File** cmdlet (Get-Item * -Stream "Zone.Identifier" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | ForEach {Unblock-File $_.FileName}), it is prudent to review the file and confirm that it is safe before unblocking.
PS C:\> Get-Item * -Stream "Zone.Identifier" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   FileName: C:\ps-test\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1

Stream                   Length
------                   ------
Zone.Identifier              26

The second command shows what happens when you run a blocked script in a Windows PowerShell session in which the execution policy is **RemoteSigned**. The RemoteSigned policy prevents you from running scripts that are downloaded from the Internet unless they are digitally signed.
PS C:\> C:\ps-test\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1
c:\ps-test\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 : File c:\ps-test\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 cannot
be loaded. The file c:\ps-test\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 is not digitally signed. The script
will not execute on the system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
At line:1 char:1
+ c:\ps-test\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess

The third command uses the **Unblock-File** cmdlet to unblock the script so it can run in the session.
PS C:\> Get-Item C:\ps-test\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 | Unblock-File
```

This command shows how to find and unblock Windows PowerShell scripts.

## PARAMETERS

### -LiteralPath
Specifies the files to unblock.
Unlike *Path*, the value of the *LiteralPath* parameter is used exactly as it is typed.
No characters are interpreted as wildcards.
If the path includes escape characters, enclose it in single quotation marks.
Single quotation marks tell Windows PowerShell not to interpret any characters as escape sequences.

```yaml

Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Path
Specifies the files to unblock.
Wildcard characters are supported.

```yaml
Type: String[]

## NOTES
* The **Unblock-File** cmdlet works only in file system drives.
* **Unblock-File** performs the same operation as the **Unblock** button on the **Properties** dialog box in File Explorer.
