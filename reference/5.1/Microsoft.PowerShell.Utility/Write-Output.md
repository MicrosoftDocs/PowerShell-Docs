# Write-Output

## SYNOPSIS
Writes the specified objects to the pipeline.

## SYNTAX

```
Write-Output [-InputObject] <PSObject[]> [-NoEnumerate] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

Writes the specified objects to the pipeline. If `Write-Output` is the last command in the pipeline,
the objects are displayed in the console.

`Write-Output` sends objects to the primary pipeline, also known as the _success stream_. To send
error objects to the error stream, use `Write-Error`.

This cmdlet is typically used in scripts to display strings and other objects on the console. One of
the built-in aliases for `Write-Output` is `echo` and similar to other shells that use `echo`. The
default behavior is to display the output at the end of a pipeline. In PowerShell, it is generally
not necessary to use the cmdlet in instances where the output is displayed by default. For example,
`Get-Process | Write-Output` is equivalent to `Get-Process`. Or, `echo "Home directory: $HOME"` can
be written, `"Home directory: $HOME"`.

By default, `Write-Output` enumerates objects in a collection. However, `Write-Output` can also
pass collections down the pipeline as a single object with the **NoEnumerate** parameter.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get objects and write them to the console

In this example, the results of the `Get-Process` cmdlet are stored in the `$P` variable. The
`Write-Output` cmdlet displays the process objects in `$P` to the console.

```powershell
$P = Get-Process
Write-Output $P
```

### Example 2: Pass output to another cmdlet

This command pipes the "test output" string to the `Get-Member` cmdlet, which displays the members
of the **System.String** class, demonstrating that the string was passed along the pipeline.

```powershell
Write-Output "test output" | Get-Member
```

### Example 3: Suppress enumeration in output

This command adds the **NoEnumerate** parameter to treat a collection or array as a single object
through the pipeline.

```powershell
Write-Output 1,2,3 | Measure-Object
```

```Output
Count    : 3
...
```

```powershell
Write-Output 1,2,3 -NoEnumerate | Measure-Object
```

```Output
Count    : 1
...
```

## PARAMETERS

### -InputObject

Specifies the objects to send down the pipeline. Enter a variable that contains the objects, or type
a command or expression that gets the objects.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.PSObject[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -NoEnumerate

By default, the `Write-Output` cmdlet always enumerates its output. The **NoEnumerate** parameter
suppresses the default behavior, and prevents `Write-Output` from enumerating output. The
**NoEnumerate** parameter has no effect if the command is wrapped in parentheses, because the
parentheses force enumeration. For example, `(Write-Output 1,2,3)` still enumerates the array.

The **NoEnumerate** parameter is only useful within a pipeline. Trying to see the effects of
**NoEnumerate** in the console is problematic because PowerShell adds `Out-Default` to the end of
every command line, which results in enumeration. But if you pipe `Write-Output -NoEnumerate` to
another cmdlet, the downstream cmdlet receives the collection object, not the enumerated items of
the collection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is an issue with this switch in Windows PowerShell that is fixed in PowerShell 6.2 and
> above. When using **NoEnumerate** and explicitly using the **InputObject** parameter, the command
> still enumerates. To work around this, pass the **InputObject** argument(s) positionally.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable,
-InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose,
-WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see
[about_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### System.Management.Automation.PSObject

You can pipe objects to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### System.Management.Automation.PSObject

This cmdlet returns the objects that are submitted as input.

## NOTES

Windows PowerShell includes the following aliases for `Write-Output`:

- `echo`
- `write`
