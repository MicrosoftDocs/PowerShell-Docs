### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Sends output to a printer.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
notes: |-
  The cmdlets that contain the `Out` verb do not format objects. They just render them and send them
  to the specified display destination. If you send an unformatted object to an `Out` cmdlet, the
  cmdlet sends it to a formatting cmdlet before rendering it.

  `Out-Printer` sends data to the printer, but does not emit any output objects to the pipeline. If
  you pipe the output of `Out-Printer` to `Get-Member`, `Get-Member` reports that no objects have been
  specified.
inputs:
- name: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.PSObject" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

    You can pipe any object to `Out-Printer`.
