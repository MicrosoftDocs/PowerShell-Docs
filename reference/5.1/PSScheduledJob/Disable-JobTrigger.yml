examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Disable a job trigger'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-JobTrigger -Name "Backup-Archives" -TriggerID 1 | Disable-JobTrigger
  description: |-
    This command disables the first trigger (ID=1) of the Backup-Archives scheduled job on the local computer.

    The command uses the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet to get the job trigger.
    A pipeline operator sends the job trigger to the **Disable-JobTrigger** cmdlet, which disables it.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Disable all job triggers'
  code: |-
    The first command uses the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get the Backup-Archives and Inventory scheduled jobs. A pipeline operator (|) sends the scheduled jobs to the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet, which gets all job triggers of the scheduled jobs. Another pipeline operator sends the job triggers to the **Disable-JobTrigger** cmdlet, which disables them.The first command uses the **Get-ScheduledJob** cmdlet to get the jobs, because its *Name* parameter takes multiple names.
    PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob -Name "Backup-Archives,Inventory" | Get-JobTrigger | Disable-JobTrigger

    The second command displays the results. The command repeats the **Get-ScheduledJob** and **Get-JobTrigger** command. A pipeline operator sends the job triggers to the Format-Table cmdlet, which displays the job triggers in a table. The **Format-Table** command adds a JobName property that displays the value of the Name property of the scheduled job in the JobDefinition property of the job trigger object.
    PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob -Name "Backup-Archives,Inventory" | Get-JobTrigger | Format-Table -Property ID, Frequency, At, DaysOfWeek, Enabled, @{Label="JobName";Expression={$_.JobDefinition.Name}} -AutoSize
    Id Frequency At                     DaysOfWeek Enabled JobName
    -- --------- --                     ---------- ------- -------
    1  Weekly    9/28/2011 3:00:00 AM   {Monday}   False   Backup-Archive
    2  Daily     9/29/2011 1:00:00 AM              False   Backup-Archive
    1  Weekly    10/20/2011 11:00:00 PM {Friday}   False   Inventory
    1  Weekly    11/2/2011 2:00:00 PM   {Monday}   False   Inventory

    These commands disable all job triggers on two scheduled jobs and display the results.

- title: 'Example 3: Disable job trigger of a scheduled job on a remote computer'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server01 {Get-JobTrigger -Name DeployPackage | Where-Object {$_.Frequency -eq "Daily"} | Disable-JobTrigger}
  description: |-
    This command disables the daily job triggers on the DeployPackage scheduled job on the Server01 remote computer.

    The command uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run the commands on the Server01 computer.
    The remote command uses the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet to get the job triggers of the DeployPackage scheduled job.
    A pipeline operator sends the job triggers to the Where-Object cmdlet, which returns only daily job triggers.
    A pipeline operator sends the daily job triggers to the **Disable-JobTrigger** cmdlet, which disables them.

description: |-
  The **Disable-JobTrigger** cmdlet temporarily disables the job triggers of scheduled jobs.
  Disabling preserves all job trigger properties, but it prevents the job trigger from starting the scheduled job.

  To use this cmdlet, use the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet to get the job triggers.
  Then pipe the job triggers to **Disable-JobTrigger** or use its *InputObject* parameter.

  To disable a job trigger, the **Disable-JobTrigger** cmdlet sets the Enabled property of the job trigger to $False.
  To re-enable the job trigger, use the Enable-JobTrigger cmdlet, which sets the **Enabled** property of the job trigger to $True.
  Disabling a job trigger does not disable the scheduled job, such as is done by the Disable-ScheduledJob cmdlet, but if you disable all job triggers, the effect is the same as disabling the scheduled job.

  If you disable a scheduled job or disable all job triggers of a scheduled job, you can still start the job by using the Start-Job cmdlet or use the disabled scheduled job as a template.

  **Disable-ScheduledJob** is one of a collection of job scheduling cmdlets in the **PSScheduledJob** module that is included in Windows PowerShell.

  For more information about Scheduled Jobs, see the About topics in the PSScheduledJob module.
  Import the PSScheduledJob module and then type: `Get-Help about_Scheduled*` or see about_Scheduled_Jobs.

  This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.
