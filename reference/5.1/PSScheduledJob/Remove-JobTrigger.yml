examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Delete all job triggers'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Remove-JobTrigger -Name "Test*"
  description: |-
    This command deletes all job triggers from scheduled job that have names that begin with Test.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Delete selected job triggers'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Remove-JobTrigger -Name "BackupArchive" -TriggerID 3
  description: |-
    This command deletes only the third trigger (ID = 3) from the BackupArchive scheduled job.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 3: Delete AtStartup job triggers from all scheduled jobs'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> function Delete-AtStartup
    {
        Get-ScheduledJob | Get-JobTrigger | Where-Object {$_.Frequency -eq "AtStartup"} | ForEach-Object { Remove-JobTrigger -InputObject $_.JobDefinition -TriggerID $_.ID}
    }
  description: |-
    This function deletes all AtStartup job triggers from all jobs on the local computer.
    To use the function, run the function in your session and then type `Delete-AtStartup`.

    The Delete-AtStartup function contains a single command.
    The command uses the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get the scheduled jobs on the local computer.
    A pipeline operator (|) sends the scheduled jobs to the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet, which gets all of the job triggers from each of the scheduled jobs.
    A pipeline operator sends the job triggers to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects job triggers where the value of the Frequency property of the job trigger equals AtStartup.

    **JobTrigger** objects have a **JobDefinition** property that contains the scheduled job that they trigger.
    The remainder of the command uses that valuable feature.

    A pipeline operator sends the AtStartup job triggers to the ForEach-Object cmdlet, which runs a **Remove-JobTrigger** command on each AtStartup trigger.
    The value of the *InputObject* parameter of **Remove-JobTrigger** is the scheduled job in the JobDefinition property of the job trigger.
    The value of the *TriggerID* parameter is the identifier in the ID property of the job trigger.

- title: 'Example 4: Delete a job trigger from a remote scheduled job'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Invoke-Command -ComputerName "Server01" { Remove-JobTrigger -ID 38 -TriggerID 1 }
  description: |-
    This command deletes the first job trigger from the Inventory job on the Server01 computer.

    The command uses the **Invoke-Command** cmdlet to run the **Remove-JobTrigger** cmdlet on the Server01 computer.
    The **Remove-JobTrigger** cmdlet uses the *ID* parameter to identify the Inventory scheduled job and the *TriggerID* parameter to specify the first trigger.
    The *ID* parameter is especially useful when multiple scheduled jobs have the same or similar names.

  The **Remove-JobTrigger** cmdlet deletes job triggers from scheduled jobs.

  A job trigger defines a recurring schedule or conditions for starting a scheduled job.
  To manage job triggers, use the New-JobTrigger, Add-JobTrigger, Set-JobTrigger, and Set-ScheduledJob cmdlets.

  Use the *Name*, *ID*, or *InputObject* parameters of **Remove-JobTrigger** to identify the scheduled jobs from which the triggers are removed.
  Use the *TriggerID* parameter to identify the job triggers to delete.
  By default, **Remove-JobTrigger** deletes all job triggers of a scheduled job.

  **Remove-JobTrigger** is one of a collection of job scheduling cmdlets in the PSScheduledJob module that is included in Windows PowerShell.

  For more information about Scheduled Jobs, see the About topics in the PSScheduledJob module.
  Import the PSScheduledJob module and then type: `Get-Help about_Scheduled*` or see about_Scheduled_Jobs.

  This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.
