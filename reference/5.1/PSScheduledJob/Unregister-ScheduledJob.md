# Unregister-ScheduledJob

## SYNOPSIS
Deletes scheduled jobs on the local computer.

## SYNTAX

### Definition (Default)
```
Unregister-ScheduledJob [-InputObject] <ScheduledJobDefinition[]> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

### DefinitionId
```
Unregister-ScheduledJob [-Id] <Int32[]> [-Force] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### DefinitionName

## DESCRIPTION
The **Unregister-ScheduledJob** cmdlet deletes scheduled jobs from the local computer.

When it deletes or unregisters a scheduled job, **Unregister-ScheduledJob** deletes the directory for the scheduled job (in the $home\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScheduledJobs directory), which contains the XML file that defines the scheduled job, the job execution history, and all job results.
This action also deletes the job from Task Scheduler.

**Unregister-ScheduledJob** deletes only the scheduled jobs that are created by using the Register-ScheduledJob cmdlet.
It does not delete scheduled jobs that are created in Task Scheduler.

You can use the parameters of **Unregister-ScheduledJob** to delete scheduled jobs by ID or name, or pipe scheduled jobs from Get-ScheduledJob to **Unregister-ScheduledJob**.

**Unregister-ScheduledJob** is one of a collection of job scheduling cmdlets in the PSScheduledJob module that is included in Windows PowerShell.

For more information about Scheduled Jobs, see the About topics in the PSScheduledJob module.
Import the PSScheduledJob module and then type: `Get-Help about_Scheduled*` or see about_Scheduled_Jobs.

This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Delete a scheduled job
```
PS C:\> Unregister-ScheduledJob TestJob
```

This command deletes the TestJob scheduled job on the local computer.

### Example 2: Delete all scheduled jobs
```
PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob | Unregister-ScheduledJob -Force
PS C:\> Unregister-ScheduledJob -Name "*" -Force
```

This example shows two different commands that delete all scheduled jobs on the local computer.

The first command uses the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get all scheduled jobs on the local computer.
A pipeline operator (|) sends the scheduled jobs to **Unregister-ScheduleJob**, which deletes them.

The second command uses the *Name* parameter of **Unregister-ScheduledJob** with a value of all (*) to delete all scheduled jobs.

Both commands use the *Force* parameter, which deletes a scheduled job even if an instance of the job is running.

### Example 3: Delete a scheduled job on a remote computer
```
PS C:\> Invoke-Command -ComputerName "Server01" { Unregister-ScheduledJob -Name "Test*"}
```

This command deletes scheduled jobs with names that begin with Test on the Server01 remote computer.
The command uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run the **Unregister-ScheduledJob** command on the Server02 computer.
