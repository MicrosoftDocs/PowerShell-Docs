  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJobOption -Name "DeployPackage"
    StartIfOnBatteries     : False
    StopIfGoingOnBatteries : True
    WakeToRun              : False

    RunWithoutNetwork      : False
    DoNotAllowDemandStart  : False
    MultipleInstancePolicy : IgnoreNew
    JobDefinition          :

    The second command uses the **Set-ScheduledJobOpton** cmdlet to change the job options so the values of the WakeToRun and RunWithoutNetwork properties are $True. The command uses the *Passthru* parameter to return the trigger after the change.
    PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJobOption -Name "DeployPackage" | Set-ScheduledJobOption -WakeToRun -RequireNetwork:$False -Passthru
    StartIfOnBatteries     : False
    StopIfGoingOnBatteries : True

    This example shows how to change the options of a scheduled job on the local computer.

    The first command uses the Get-ScheduledJobOption cmdlet to get the job options of the DeployPackage scheduled job.
    The output shows that the WakeToRun and RunElevated properties are set to $False.

    This command is not required; it is included only to show the effect of the option change.

- title: 'Example 2: Change an option on all remote scheduled jobs'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Invoke-Command -Computer "Server01" -ScriptBlock {Get-ScheduledJob | Get-ScheduledJobOption | Set-ScheduledJobOption -IdleTimeout 2:00:00}
  description: |-
    This command changes the value of the *IdleTimeout* from one hour (the default value) to two hours on all scheduled jobs on the Server01 computer.

    The command uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a command on the Server01 computer.

    The remote command begins with a Get-ScheduledJob command that gets all scheduled jobs on the computer.
    The scheduled jobs are piped to the Get-ScheduledJobOption cmdlet, which gets the job options of the scheduled jobs.
    Each job options object contains a JobDefinition property that contains the scheduled job, so the options object remains associated with the scheduled job even when it is changed.

    The job triggers are piped to the **Set-ScheduledJobOption** cmdlet, which changes the value of the *IdleTimeout* option to two hours (2:00:00).

- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: DoNotAllowDemandStart
  description: |+
    Start the job only when it is triggered.
    Users cannot start the job manually, such as by using the Run feature in Task Scheduler.

    This parameter only affects Task Scheduler.
    It does not prevents users from using the Start-Job cmdlet to start the job.

    The *DoNotAllowDemandStart* parameter sets the value of the DoNotAllowDemandStart property of scheduled jobs to $True.

- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: HideInTaskScheduler
  description: |+
    Do not display the job in Task Scheduler.
    This value affects only the computer on which the job runs.
    By default, scheduled tasks appear in Task Scheduler.

    Even if a task is hidden, users can display the task by selecting the **Show hidden tasks** view option in Task Scheduler.

    The *HideInTaskScheduler* parameter sets the value of the ShowInTaskScheduler property of scheduled jobs to $False.

  description: |+
    Specifies how long the computer must be idle before the job starts.
    The default value is 10 minutes.
    If the computer is not idle for the specified duration before the value of *IdleTimeout* expires, the scheduled job does not run until the next scheduled time, if any.

    Enter a timespan object, such as one generated by the New-TimeSpan cmdlet, or enter a value in \<hours\>:\<minutes\>:\<seconds\> format that is automatically converted to a **TimeSpan** object.

    To enable this value, use the *StartIfIdle* parameter.
    By default, the StartIfNotIdle property of scheduled jobs is set to $True and Windows PowerShell ignores the *IdleDuration* and *IdleTimeout* values.

- type: <xref href="Microsoft.PowerShell.ScheduledJob.TaskMultipleInstancePolicy" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: MultipleInstancePolicy
  description: |+
    Determines how the system responds to a request to start an instance of a scheduled job while another instance of the job is running.
    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - IgnoreNew.
    The new job instance is ignored.
    This is the default value.
    - Parallel.
    The new job instance starts immediately.
    - Queue.
    The new job instance starts as soon as the current instance completes.
    - StopExisting.
    The current instance of the job stop and the new instance starts.

    To run the job, all conditions for the job schedule must be met.
    For example, if the conditions that are set by the *RequireNetwork*, *IdleDuration*, and *IdleTimeout* parameters are not satisfied, the job instance is not started, regardless of the value of this parameter.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RequireNetwork
  description: |+
    Runs the scheduled job only when network connections are available.

    If you specify this parameter and the network is not available at the scheduled start time, the job does not run until the next scheduled start time, if any.

    The *RequireNetwork* parameter sets the value of the RunWithoutNetwork property of scheduled jobs to $False.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RestartOnIdleResume
  description: |+
    Restarts a scheduled job when the computer becomes idle.
    This parameter works with the *StopIfGoingOffIdle* parameter, which suspends a running scheduled job if the computer becomes active (leaves the idle state).

    The *RestartOnIdleResume* parameter sets the value of the RestartOnIdleResume property of scheduled jobs to $True.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: RunElevated
  description: |+
    Runs the scheduled job with the permissions of a member of the Administrators group on the computer on which the job runs.

    To enable a scheduled job to run with Administrator permissions, use the *Credential* parameter of Register-ScheduledJob to provide explicit credential for the job.

    The **RunElevated** parameter sets the value of the **RunElevated** property of scheduled jobs to True.

  defaultValue: None

    Starts the scheduled job if the computer has been idle for the time specified by the **IdleDuration** parameter before the time specified by the *IdleTimeout* parameter expires.

    By default, the *IdleDuration* and *IdleTimeout* parameters are ignored and the job starts at the scheduled start time even if the computer is busy.

    If you specify this parameter and the computer is busy (not idle) at the scheduled start time, the job does not run until the next scheduled start time, if any.

    The *StartIfIdle* parameter sets the value of the **StartIfNotIdle** property of scheduled jobs to False.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: StartIfOnBattery
  description: |+
    Starts the scheduled job even if the computer is running on batteries at the scheduled start time.

    By default, a scheduled job that is suspended when the computer becomes active resumes when the computer becomes idle again.
    To change this default behavior, use the *RestartOnIdleResume* parameter.

    The *StopIfGoingOffIdle* parameter sets the value of the StopIfGoingOffIdle property of scheduled jobs to $True.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WakeToRun
  description: |+
    Wakes the computer from a Hibernate or Sleep state at the scheduled start time so it can run the job.
    By default, if the computer is in a Hibernate or Sleep state at the scheduled start time, the job does not run.

    The *WakeToRun* parameter sets the value of the WakeToRun property of scheduled jobs to $True.

  defaultValue: None

uid: PSScheduledJob.Set-ScheduledJobOption
name: Set-ScheduledJobOption
description: |-
  The **Set-ScheduledJobOptions** cmdlet changes the job options of scheduled jobs.

  To change the options of a scheduled job, begin by using the Get-ScheduledJobOption cmdlet to get the job options of a scheduled job.
  Then, pipe the options to **Set-ScheduledJobOption** or save the options in a variable and use the *InputObject* parameter of **Set-ScheduledJobOption** cmdlet to identify the options.
  Use the remaining parameters of **Set-ScheduledJobOption** to change the job options.

  To turn on a job option, use the parameter that sets that option.
  To turn off an option, type the parameter name, a colon (:), and $False.
  For example, to turn off the *RunElevated* option, type `-RunElevated:$False`.

  Each job options object includes a JobDefinition property that contains the scheduled job, so the association with the scheduled job is retained when the job options are changed.

  The scheduled job options determine how the job runs when it is started by Task Scheduler.
  These options to not apply when you use the Start-Job cmdlet to start a scheduled job.

  **Set-ScheduledJobOption** is one of a collection of job scheduling cmdlets in the PSScheduledJob module that is included in Windows PowerShell.

  For more information about Scheduled Jobs, see the About topics in the PSScheduledJob module.
  Import the PSScheduledJob module and then type: `Get-Help about_Scheduled*` or see about_Scheduled_Jobs.

  This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.
