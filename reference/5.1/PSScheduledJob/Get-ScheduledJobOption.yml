    NewJobDefinition       : Microsoft.PowerShell.ScheduledJob.ScheduledJobDefinition
  description: |-
    This command gets the job options of scheduled jobs that have BackUp in their names.
    The results show the job options object that **Get-ScheduledJobOption** returned.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Get all job options'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob | Get-ScheduledJobOption
  description: |-
    This command gets the job options of all scheduled jobs on the local computer.

    It uses the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get the scheduled jobs on the local computer.
    A pipeline operator (|) sends the scheduled jobs to the **Get-ScheduledJobOption** cmdlet, which gets the job options of each scheduled job.

- title: 'Example 3: Get selected job options'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob | Get-ScheduledJobOption | Where {$_.RunElevated -and !$_.WaketoRun}

    NewJobDefinition       : Microsoft.PowerShell.ScheduledJob.ScheduledJobDefinition

    The second command shows how to find to which scheduled job the job options belong. This command uses a pipeline operator (|) to send the selected job options to the ForEach-Object cmdlet, which gets the JobDefinition property of each options object. The JobDefinition property contains the originating job object. The results show that the selected options came from the DeployPkg scheduled job.
    PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob | Get-ScheduledJobOption | Where {$_.RunElevated -and !$_.WaketoRun} | ForEach-Object {$_.JobDefinition}
    Id         Name            Triggers        Command                                  Enabled

    --         ----            --------        -------                                  -------

    2          DeployPkg         {1, 2}        DeployPackage.ps1                        True
  description: |-
    This example shows how to find job options object with particular values.

    The first command gets job options in which the RunElevated property has a value of $True and the RunWithoutNetwork property has a value of $False.
    The output shows the **JobOptions** object that was selected.

- title: 'Example 4: Use job options to create a new job'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Opts = Get-ScheduledJobOption -Name "BackupTestLogs"
    PS C:\> Register-ScheduledJob -Name "Archive-Scripts" -FilePath "\\Srv01\Scripts\ArchiveScripts.ps1" -ScheduledJobOption $Opts
  description: |-
    This example shows how to use the job options that Get-ScheduledJobOption gets in a new scheduled job.

    The first command uses **Get-ScheduledJobOption** to get the jobs options of the BackupTestLogs scheduled job.
    The command saves the options in the $Opts variable.

    The second command uses Register-ScheduledJob cmdlet to create a new scheduled job.
    The value of the *ScheduledJobOption* parameter is the options object in the $Opts variable.

  code: |-
    PS C:\> $O = Invoke-Command -ComputerName "Srv01" -ScriptBlock {Get-ScheduledJob -Name "DataDemon" }

  The **Get-ScheduledJobOption** cmdlet gets the job options of scheduled jobs.
  You can use this command to examine the job options or to pipe the job options to other cmdlets.

  Job options are not saved to disk independently; they are part of a scheduled job.
  To get the job options of a scheduled job, specify the scheduled job.

  Use the parameters of the **Get-ScheduledJobOption** cmdlet to identify the scheduled job.
  You can identify scheduled jobs by their names or identification numbers, or by entering or piping **ScheduledJob** objects, such as those that are returned by the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet, to **Get-ScheduledJobOption**.

  **Get-ScheduledJobOption** is one of a collection of job scheduling cmdlets in the PSScheduledJob module that is included in Windows PowerShell.

  For more information about Scheduled Jobs, see the About topics in the PSScheduledJob module.
  Import the PSScheduledJob module and then type: `Get-Help about_Scheduled*` or see about_Scheduled_Jobs.

  This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.
