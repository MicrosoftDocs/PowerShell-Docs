# SHORT DESCRIPTION

Explains how to resolve problems with scheduled jobs

# LONG DESCRIPTION

This section describes some of the problems that you might encounter when
using the scheduled job features of Windows PowerShell and it suggests
solutions to these problems.

Before using Windows PowerShell scheduled jobs, see about_Scheduled_Jobs
and the related scheduled jobs about topics.

This topic contains the following sections:
-  CANNOT FIND JOB RESULTS
-  SCHEDULED JOB DOES NOT RUN
-  CANNOT GET SCHEDULED JOB : SCHEDULED JOB IS CORRUPTED
-  JOB CMDLETS CANNOT CONSISTENTLY FIND SCHEDULED JOBS

# CANNOT FIND JOB RESULTS

## Basic method for getting job results in Windows PowerShell

When a scheduled job runs, it creates an "instance" of the scheduled job.
To view, manage, and  get the results of scheduled job instances, use the
Job cmdlets.

NOTE: To use the Job cmdlets on instances of scheduled jobs, the
PSScheduledJob module must be imported into the session. To import
the PSScheduledJob module, type "Import-Module PSScheduledJob"
(without quotation marks) or use any Scheduled Job cmdlet, such as
Get-ScheduledJob.

To get a list of all instances of a scheduled job, use the Get-Job cmdlet.

```

PS C:> Import-Module PSScheduledJob
PS C:> Get-Job ProcessJob

Id     Name         PSJobTypeName   State         HasMoreData     Location
--     ----         -------------   -----         -----------     --------
43     ProcessJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     False           localhost
44     ProcessJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     False           localhost
45     ProcessJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     False           localhost
46     ProcessJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     False           localhost
47     ProcessJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     False           localhost
48     ProcessJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     False           localhost
49     ProcessJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     False           localhost
50     ProcessJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed     False           localhost

```

The following command uses the Format-Table cmdlet to display the Name, ID, and
PSBeginTime properties of a scheduled job instance in a table.

```

PS C:> Get-Job ProcessJob | Format-Table -Property Name, ID, PSBeginTime -Auto

Name       Id PSBeginTime
----       -- ---------
ProcessJob 43 11/2/2011 3:00:02 AM
ProcessJob 44 11/3/2011 3:00:02 AM
ProcessJob 45 11/4/2011 3:00:02 AM
ProcessJob 46 11/5/2011 3:00:02 AM
ProcessJob 47 11/6/2011 3:00:02 AM
ProcessJob 48 11/7/2011 12:00:01 AM
ProcessJob 49 11/7/2011 3:00:02 AM
ProcessJob 50 11/8/2011 3:00:02 AM

```

To get the results of an instance of a scheduled job, use the
Receive-Job cmdlet. The following command gets the results of the
newest instance of the ProcessJob (ID = 50).

```

PS C:> Receive-Job -ID 50

```

# Basic method for finding job results on disk

To manage scheduled jobs, use the Job cmdlets, such as Get-Job and
Receive-Job.

If Get-Job does not get the job instance or Receive-Job does not get
the job results, you can search the execution history files for the
job on disk. The execution history contains a record of all triggered
job instances.

Verify that there is a timestamp-named directory in the directory
for a scheduled job in the following path:

`$home\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScheduledJob
<ScheduledJobName>\Output`

Typically:
`C:\Users<UserName>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScheduledJob
<ScheduledJobName>\Output`

For example, the following command gets the on-disk execution history
of the ProcessJob scheduled job.

```

PS C:> dir $home\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell
\ScheduledJobs\ProcessJob\Output

Directory: C:\Users\User01\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell
\ScheduledJobs\ProcessJob\Output

Mode                LastWriteTime     Length Name
----                -------------     ------ ----
d----         11/2/2011   3:00 AM            20111102-030002-260
d----         11/3/2011   3:00 AM            20111103-030002-277
d----         11/4/2011   3:00 AM            20111104-030002-209
d----         11/5/2011   3:00 AM            20111105-030002-251
d----         11/6/2011   3:00 AM            20111106-030002-174
d----         11/7/2011  12:00 AM            20111107-000001-914
d----         11/7/2011   3:00 AM            20111107-030002-376

```

Each timestamp-named directory represents a job instance. The results
of each job instance are saved in a Results.xml file in the
timestamp-named directory.

For example, the following command gets the Results.xml files for
every saved instance of the ProcessJob scheduled job.
```

PS C:> dir $home\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScheduledJobs
\ProcessJob\Output\*\Results.xml

Directory: C:\Users\User01\Appdata\Local\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell
\ScheduledJobs\ProcessJob\Output

```
If the Results.xml file is missing, Windows PowerShell cannot return
or display the job results.

# The Job cmdlet might not be able to get scheduled job instances or
their results because the PSScheduledJob module is not imported into
the session.


NOTE:   Before using a Job cmdlet on scheduled job instances, verify that
the PSScheduledJob module is included in the session. Without the
module, the Job cmdlets cannot get scheduled job instances or
their results.

To import the PSScheduledJob module, type:

```

Import-Module PSScheduledJob

```

# The Receive-Job cmdlet might already have returned the results in the
current session.

If Receive-Job does not return job instance results, it might be
because a Receive-Job command has been run for that job instance
in the current session without the Keep parameter.

When you use Receive-Job without the Keep parameter, Receive-Job
returns the job results and sets the HasMoreData property of the job
instance to False to indicate that it returned all of the results
for the job instance and has no more results to return. This setting
is appropriate for standard background jobs, but not for instances
of scheduled jobs, which are saved to disk.

To get the job instance results again, start a new Windows PowerShell
session (type "PowerShell" without quotation marks), import the
PSScheduledJob module, and try the Receive-Job command again.

```

# The scheduled job might be corrupted.

If a scheduled job becomes corrupted, Windows PowerShell deletes
the corrupted scheduled job and its results. You cannot recover the
results of a corrupted scheduled job.

To determine if a scheduled job still exists, use the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet.

```

PS C:> Get-ScheduledJob

```

# The number of results might have exceeded the ExecutionHistoryLength
of the scheduled job.

The ExecutionHistoryLength property of a scheduled job determines
how many job instances, and their results, are saved to disk. The
default value is 32. When the number of instances of a scheduled
job exceeds this value, Windows PowerShell deletes the oldest job
instance to make room for each new job instance.

To get the value of the ExecutionHistoryLength property of a
scheduled job, use the following command format:

```

(Get-ScheduledJob <JobName>).ExecutionHistoryLength

```

For example, the following command gets the value of the
ExecutionHistoryLength property of the ProcessJob scheduled job.

```

PS C:> (Get-ScheduledJob ProcessJob).ExecutionHistoryLength

```

To set or change the value of the ExecutionHistoryLength property,
use the MaxResultCount parameter of the Register-ScheduledJob and
Set-ScheduledJob cmdlets.

The following command increases the value of the ExecutionHistoryLength
property to 50.

```

PS C:> Get-ScheduledJob ProcessJob | Set-ScheduledJob -MaxResultCount 50

```

# The job instance results might have been deleted

The ClearExecutionHistory parameter of the Set-ScheduledJob cmdlet
deletes the execution history of a job. You can use this feature to
free up disk space or delete results that are not needed, or already
used, analyzed or saved in a different location.

To delete the execution history of a scheduled job, use the
ClearExecutionHistory parameter of the scheduled job.

The following command deletes the execution history of the
ProcessJob scheduled job.

```

PS C:> Get-ScheduledJob ProcessJob | Set-ScheduledJob -ClearExecutionHistory

```

Also, the Remove-Job cmdlet deletes job results. When you use
Remove-Job to delete a scheduled job, it deletes all instances
of the job on disk, including the execution history and all job
results.

# Jobs started by using the Start-Job cmdlet are not saved to disk.

When you use Start-Job to start a scheduled job, instead of
using a job trigger, Start-Job starts a standard background job.
The background job and its results are not stored in the
execution history of the job on disk.

You can use the Get-Job cmdlet to get the job and the Receive-Job
cmdlet to get the job results, but the results are available only
until you receive them, unless you use the Keep parameter of the
Receive-Job cmdlet.

Also, background jobs and their results are session-specific;
they exist only in the session in which they are created. If
you delete the job (Remove-Job), close the session or close
Windows PowerShell, the job instance and its results are deleted.

# SCHEDULED JOB DOES NOT RUN


## Scheduled jobs do not run automatically if the job triggers or the
scheduled job are disabled.

Use the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get the scheduled job. Verify that the
value of the Enabled property of the scheduled job is True ($true).

```

PS C:> Get-ScheduledJob ProcessJob

Id         Name            Triggers        Command         Enabled
--         ----            --------        -------         -------
4          ProcessJob      {1, 2}          Get-Process     True

PS C:> (Get-ScheduledJob ProcessJob).Enabled
True

```

Use the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet to get the job triggers of the scheduled
job. Verify that the value of the Enabled property of the job trigger
is True ($true)

```

PS C:> Get-ScheduledJob ProcessJob | Get-JobTrigger

Id         Frequency       Time                   DaysOfWeek              Enabled
--         ---------       ----                   ----------              -------
1          Weekly          11/7/2011 5:00:00 AM   {Monday, Thursday}      True
2          Daily           11/7/2011 3:00:00 PM                           True

PS C:> Get-ScheduledJob ProcessJob | Get-JobTrigger | Format-Table ID, Enabled -Auto

Id Enabled
-- -------
1    True
2    True

```

## Scheduled jobs do not run automatically if the job triggers are
invalid.

For example, a job trigger might specify a date in the past or a date
that does not occur, such as the 5th Monday of the month.

## Scheduled jobs do not run automatically if the conditions of the job
trigger or the job options are not satisfied.

For example, a scheduled job that runs only when a particular user
logs on to the computer will not run if that user does not log on
or only connects remotely.

Examine the options of the scheduled job and make sure that they
are satisfied. For example, a scheduled job that requires that the
computer be idle or requires a network connection, or has a long
IdleDuration or a brief IdleTimeout might never run.

Use the Get-ScheduledJobOption cmdlet to examine the job options
and their values.

```

PS C:> Get-ScheduledJob -Name ProcessJob

StartIfOnBatteries     : False
StopIfGoingOnBatteries : True
WakeToRun              : True
StartIfNotIdle         : True
StopIfGoingOffIdle     : False
RestartOnIdleResume    : False
IdleDuration           : 00:10:00
IdleTimeout            : 01:00:00
ShowInTaskScheduler    : True
RunElevated            : False
RunWithoutNetwork      : True
DoNotAllowDemandStart  : False
MultipleInstancePolicy : IgnoreNew
JobDefinition          : Microsoft.PowerShell.ScheduledJob.ScheduledJobDefinition

```

For descriptions of the scheduled job options, see the help topic for
the New-ScheduledJobOption cmdlet (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=223919).

## The scheduled job instance might have failed.

If a scheduled job command fails, Windows PowerShell reports it
immediately by generating an error message. However, if the job fails
when Task Scheduler tries to run it, the error is not available to
Windows PowerShell.

Use the following methods to detect and correct job failures.

## Check the Task Scheduler event log for errors. To check the log,
use Event Viewer or a Windows PowerShell command such as the
following:

```

Get-WinEvent -LogName Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational | 
 Where {$_.Message -like "fail"}

```

## Check the job record in Task Scheduler. Windows PowerShell
scheduled jobs are stored in the following Task Scheduled folder:

Task Scheduler Library\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScheduledJobs

## The scheduled job might not run because of insuffienct permission.

Scheduled jobs run with the permissions of the user who created the
job or the permissions of the user who is specified by the Credential
parameter in the Register-ScheduledJob or Set-ScheduledJob command.

If that user does not have permission to run the commands or scripts,
the job fails.

# CANNOT GET SCHEDULED JOB : SCHEDULED JOB IS CORRUPTED

On rare occasions, scheduled jobs can become corrupted or contain
internal contradictions that cannot be resolved. Typically, this
happens when the XML files for the scheduled job are manually edited,
resulting in invalid XML.

When a scheduled job is corrupted, Windows PowerShell attempts to
delete the scheduled job, its execution history, and its results
from disk.

If it cannot remove the scheduled job, you will get a corrupted job
error message each time you run the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet.

To remove a corrupted scheduled job, use either one of the following
methods.

## Delete the <ScheduledJobName> directory for the scheduled job.
Do not delete the ScheduledJob directory.

The directory is located at `$env:UserProfile\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell
\ScheduledJobs<ScheduledJobName>`

Typically:
`C:\Users<UserName>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\
ScheduledJobs<ScheduledJobName>.`

## Use Task Scheduler to delete the scheduled job. Windows PowerShell
scheduled tasks appear in the following Task Scheduler path:

Task Scheduler Library\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScheduledJobs<ScheduledJobName>

## JOB CMDLETS CANNOT CONSISTENTLY FIND SCHEDULED JOBS

When the PSScheduledJob module is not in the current session, the
Job cmdlets cannot get scheduled jobs, start them, or get their
results.

To import the PSScheduledJob module, type "Import-Module PSScheduledJob"
or run or get any cmdlet in the module, such as the Get-ScheduledJob
cmdlet. Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, modules are imported
automatically when you get or use any cmdlet in the module.

When the PSScheduledJob cmdlet is not in the current session, the
following command sequence is possible.

```

PS C:> Get-Job ProcessJob

Get-Job : The command cannot find the job because the job name
ProcessJob was not found.
Verify the value of the Name parameter, and then try the command again.
+ CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (ProcessJob:String) [Get-Job],
PSArgumentException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : JobWithSpecifiedNameNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.
Commands.GetJobCommand

PS C:> Get-Job
PS C:> Get-ScheduledJob ProcessJob

Id         Name            Triggers        Command      Enabled
--         ----            --------        -------      -------
4          ProcessJob      {1}             Get-Process  True

PS C:> Get-Job ProcessJob

Id     Name         PSJobTypeName   State       HasMoreData     Location
--     ----         -------------   -----       -----------     --------
43     ProcessJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed   True            localhost
44     ProcessJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed   True            localhost
45     ProcessJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed   True            localhost
46     ProcessJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed   True            localhost
47     ProcessJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed   True            localhost
48     ProcessJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed   True            localhost
49     ProcessJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed   True            localhost
50     ProcessJob   PSScheduledJob  Completed   True            localhost

```

This behavior occurs because the Get-ScheduledJob command automatically
imports the PSScheduledJob module, and then runs the command.
