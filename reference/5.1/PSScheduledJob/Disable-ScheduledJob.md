# Disable-ScheduledJob

## SYNOPSIS
Disables a scheduled job.

## SYNTAX

### Definition (Default)
```
Disable-ScheduledJob [-InputObject] <ScheduledJobDefinition> [-PassThru] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

### DefinitionId
```
Disable-ScheduledJob [-Id] <Int32> [-PassThru] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### DefinitionName
```
Disable-ScheduledJob [-Name] <String> [-PassThru] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Disable-ScheduledJob** cmdlet temporarily disables scheduled jobs.
Disabling preserves all job properties and does not disable the job triggers, but it prevents the scheduled jobs from starting automatically when triggered.
You can start a disabled scheduled job by using the Start-Job cmdlet or use a disabled scheduled job as a template.

To disable a scheduled job, the **Disable-ScheduledJob** cmdlet sets the **Enabled** property of the scheduled job to False ($false).
To re-enable the scheduled job, use the Enable-ScheduledJob cmdlet.

**Disable-ScheduledJob** is one of a collection of job scheduling cmdlets in the **PSScheduledJob** module that is included in Windows PowerShell.

For more information about Scheduled Jobs, see the About topics in the PSScheduledJob module.
Import the PSScheduledJob module and then type: `Get-Help about_Scheduled*` or see about_Scheduled_Jobs.

This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Disable a scheduled job
```
PS C:\> Disable-ScheduledJob -ID 2 -Passthru
Id         Name            Triggers        Command                                  Enabled
--         ----            --------        -------                                  -------
2          Inventory       {1, 2}          \\Srv01\Scripts\Get-FullInventory.ps1    False
```

This command disables the scheduled job with ID 2 on the local computer.
The output shows the effect of the command.

### Example 2: Disable all scheduled jobs
```
PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob | Disable-ScheduledJob -Passthru
Id         Name            Triggers        Command                                  Enabled
--         ----            --------        -------                                  -------
1          ArchiveProje... {}              C:\Scripts\Archive-DxProjects.ps1        False
2          Inventory       {1, 2}          \\Srv01\Scripts\Get-FullInventory.ps1    False
4          Test-HelpFiles  {1}             .\Test-HelpFiles.ps1                     False
5          TestJob         {1, 2}          .\Run-AllTests.ps1                       False
```

This command disables all scheduled jobs on the local computer.
It uses the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get all scheduled job and the **Disable-ScheduledJob** cmdlet to disable them.

You can re-enable scheduled job by using the Enable-ScheduledJob cmdlet and run a disabled scheduled job by using the Start-Job cmdlet.

**Disable-ScheduledJob** does not generate warnings or errors if you disable a scheduled job that is already disabled, so you can disable all scheduled jobs without conditions.

### Example 3: Disable selected scheduled jobs
```
PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob | Where-Object {!$_.Credential} | Disable-ScheduledJob
```

This command disables scheduled job do not include a credential.
Jobs without credentials run with the permission of the user who created them.

The command uses the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get all scheduled jobs on the computer.
A pipeline operator sends the scheduled jobs to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects scheduled jobs that do not have credentials.
The command uses the not (!) operator and references the Credential property of the scheduled job.
Another pipeline operator sends the selected scheduled jobs to the **Disable-ScheduledJob** cmdlet, which disables them.

### Example 4: Disable scheduled jobs on a remote computer
```
PS C:\> Invoke-Command -ComputerName Srv01, Srv10 -ScriptBlock {Disable-ScheduledJob -Name TestJob}
```

This command disables the TestJob scheduled job on two remote computers, Srv01 and Srv10.

The command uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a **Disable-ScheduledJob** command on the Srv01 and Srv10 computers.
The command uses the *Name* parameter of **Disable-ScheduledJob** to select the TestJob scheduled job on each computer.

### Example 5: Disable a scheduled job by its global ID
```
The first command demonstrates one way of finding the GlobalID of a scheduled job. The command uses the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get the scheduled jobs on the computer. A pipeline operator (|) sends the scheduled jobs to the Format-Table cmdlet, which displays the Name, GlobalID, and Command properties of each job in a table.
PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob | Format-Table -Property Name, GlobalID, Command -Autosize
Name             GlobalId                             Command
----             --------                             -------
ArchiveProjects1 a26a0b3d-b4e6-44d3-8b95-8706ef621f7c C:\Scripts\Archive-DxProjects.ps1
Inventory        3ac37e5d-84c0-4a8f-9661-7e88ebb8f914 \\Srv01\Scripts\Get-FullInventory.ps1
Backup-Scripts   4d0cc6be-c082-48d1-baec-1bd8278f3c81  Copy-Item C:\CurrentScripts\*.ps1 -Destination C:\BackupScripts
Test-HelpFiles   d77020ca-f20d-42be-86c8-fc64df97db90 .\Test-HelpFiles.ps1
Test-HelpFiles   2f1606d2-c6cf-4bef-8b1c-ae36a9cc9934 .\Test-DomainHelpFiles.ps1

The second command uses the  Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get the scheduled jobs on the computer. A pipeline operator (|) sends the scheduled jobs to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects the scheduled job with the specified global ID. Another pipeline operator sends the job to the **Disable-ScheduledJob** cmdlet, which disables it.
PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob | Where-Object {$_.GlobalID = d77020ca-f20d-42be-86c8-fc64df97db90} | Disable-ScheduledJob
```

This examples shows how to disable a scheduled job by using its global identifier.
The value of the GlobalID property of a scheduled job is a unique identifier (GUID).
Use the GlobalID value when precision is required, such as when you are disabling scheduled jobs on multiple computers.
