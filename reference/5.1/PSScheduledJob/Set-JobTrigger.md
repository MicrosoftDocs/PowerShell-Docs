# Set-JobTrigger

## SYNOPSIS
Changes the job trigger of a scheduled job.

## SYNTAX

```
Set-JobTrigger [-InputObject] <ScheduledJobTrigger[]> [-DaysInterval <Int32>] [-WeeksInterval <Int32>]
 [-RandomDelay <TimeSpan>] [-At <DateTime>] [-User <String>] [-DaysOfWeek <DayOfWeek[]>] [-AtStartup]
 [-AtLogOn] [-Once] [-RepetitionInterval <TimeSpan>] [-RepetitionDuration <TimeSpan>] [-RepeatIndefinitely]
 [-Daily] [-Weekly] [-PassThru] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Set-JobTrigger** cmdlet changes the properties of the job triggers of scheduled jobs.
You can use it to change the time or frequency at which the jobs start or to change from a time-based schedules to schedules that are triggered by a logon or startup.

A job trigger defines a recurring schedule or conditions for starting a scheduled job.
Although job triggers are not saved to disk, you can change the job triggers of scheduled jobs, which are saved to disk.

To change a job trigger of a scheduled job, begin by using the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet to get the job trigger of a scheduled job.
Then, pipe the trigger to **Set-JobTrigger** or save the trigger in a variable and use the *InputObject* parameter of **Set-JobTrigger** cmdlet to identify the trigger.
Use the remaining parameters of **Set-JobTrigger** to change the job trigger.

When you change the type of a job trigger, such as changing a job trigger from a daily or weekly trigger to an *AtLogon* trigger, the original trigger properties are deleted.
However, if you change the values of the trigger, but not its type, such as changing the days in a weekly trigger, only the properties that you specify are changed.
All other properties of the original job trigger are retained.

**Set-JobTrigger** is one of a collection of job scheduling cmdlets in the PSScheduledJob module that is included in Windows PowerShell.

For more information about Scheduled Jobs, see the About topics in the PSScheduledJob module.
Import the PSScheduledJob module and then type: `Get-Help about_Scheduled*`  or see about_Scheduled_Jobs.

This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Change the days in a job trigger
```
PS C:\> Get-JobTrigger -Name "DeployPackage"
Id         Frequency       Time                   DaysOfWeek              Enabled
--         ---------       ----                   ----------              -------
1          Weekly          9/29/2011 12:00:00 AM  {Wednesday, Saturday}   True

The second command uses the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet to get the job trigger of the DeployPackage scheduled job. A pipeline operator (|) sends the trigger to the **Set-JobTrigger** cmdlet, which changes the job trigger so that it starts the DeployPackage job on Wednesdays and Sundays. The command uses the *Passthru* parameter to return the trigger after the change.
PS C:\> Get-JobTrigger -Name "DeployPackage" | Set-JobTrigger -DaysOfWeek "Wednesday", "Sunday" -Passthru
Id         Frequency       Time                   DaysOfWeek              Enabled
--         ---------       ----                   ----------              -------
1          Weekly          9/29/2011 12:00:00 AM  {Wednesday, Sunday}     True
```

This example shows how to change the days in a weekly job trigger.

The first command uses the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet to get the job trigger of the DeployPackage scheduled job.
The output shows that the trigger starts the job at midnight on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

This command is not required; it is included only to show the effect of the trigger change.

### Example 2: Change the job trigger type
```
PS C:\> Get-JobTrigger -Name "Inventory"
Id         Frequency       Time                   DaysOfWeek              Enabled
--         ---------       ----                   ----------              -------
1          Daily           9/27/2011 11:00:00 PM                          True
2          AtStartup                                                      True

The second command uses the **Get-JobTrigger** cmdlet to get the *AtStartup* job trigger of the Inventory job. The command uses the *TriggerID* parameter to identify the job trigger. A pipeline operator (|) sends the job trigger to the **Set-JobTrigger** cmdlet, which changes it to a weekly job trigger that runs every four weeks on Monday at midnight. The command uses the *Passthru* parameter to return the trigger after the change.
PS C:\> Get-JobTrigger -Name "Inventory" -TriggerID 2 | Set-JobTrigger -Weekly -WeeksInterval 4 -DaysOfWeek Monday -At "12:00 AM"
Id         Frequency       Time                   DaysOfWeek              Enabled
--         ---------       ----                   ----------              -------
1          Daily           9/27/2011 11:00:00 PM                          True
2          Weekly          10/31/2011 12:00:00 AM {Monday}                True
```

This example shows how to change the type of job trigger that starts a job.
The commands in this example replace an AtStartup job trigger with a weekly trigger.

The first command uses the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet to get the job trigger of the Inventory scheduled job.
The output shows that the job has two triggers a daily trigger and an *AtStartup* trigger.

This command is not required; it is included only to show the effect of the trigger change.

### Example 3: Change the user on a remote job trigger
```
PS C:\> Invoke-Command -ComputerName "Server01" -ScriptBlock {Get-ScheduledJob | Get-JobTrigger | Where-Object {$_.User} | Set-JobTrigger -User "Domain01/Admin02"}
```

This command changes the user in all *AtLogon* job triggers of scheduled jobs on the Server01 computer.

The command uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a command on the Server01 computer.

The remote command begins with a Get-ScheduledJob command that gets all scheduled jobs on the computer.
The scheduled jobs are piped to the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet, which gets the job triggers of the scheduled jobs.
Each job trigger contains a JobDefinition property that contains the scheduled job, so the trigger remains associated with the scheduled job even when it is changed.

The job triggers are piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which gets job triggers that have the User property.
The selected job triggers are piped to the **Set-JobTrigger** cmdlet, which changes the user to Domain01\Admin02.

### Example 4: Change one of many job triggers
```
PS C:\> Get-JobTrigger -Name "SecurityCheck"
Id         Frequency       Time                   DaysOfWeek              Enabled
--         ---------       ----                   ----------              -------
1          Daily           4/24/2013 3:00:00 AM                           True
2          Weekly          4/24/2013 4:00:00 PM   {Sunday}                True
3          Once            4/24/2013 4:00:00 PM                           True

The second command uses the **TriggerID** parameter of the **Get-JobTrigger** cmdlet to get the *Once* trigger of the SecurityCheck scheduled job. The command pipes the trigger to the Format-List cmdlet, which displays all of the properties of the *Once* job trigger.The output shows that the trigger starts the job once every hour (RepetitionInterval = 1 hour) for one day (RepetitionDuration = 1 day).
PS C:\> Get-JobTrigger -Name "SecurityCheck" -TriggerID 3 | Format-List -Property *
At                 : 4/24/2012 4:00:00 PM
DaysOfWeek         :
Interval           : 1
Frequency          : Once
RandomDelay        : 00:00:00
RepetitionInterval : 01:00:00
RepetitionDuration : 1.00:00:00
User               :
Id                 : 3
Enabled            : True
JobDefinition      : Microsoft.PowerShell.ScheduledJob.ScheduledJobDefinition

The third command changes the repetition interval of the job trigger from one hour to 90 minutes. The command does not return any output.
PS C:\> Get-JobTrigger -Name "SecurityCheck" -TriggerId 3 | Set-JobTrigger -RepetitionInterval (New-TimeSpan -Minutes 90)

The fourth command displays the effect of the change.The output shows that the trigger starts the job once every 90 minutes (RepetitionInterval = 1 hour, 30 minutes) for one day (RepetitionDuration = 1 day).
PS C:\> Get-JobTrigger -Name "SecurityCheck" -TriggerID 3 | Format-List -Property *
At                 : 4/24/2012 4:00:00 PM
DaysOfWeek         :
Interval           : 1
Frequency          : Once
RandomDelay        : 00:00:00
RepetitionInterval : 01:30:00
RepetitionDuration : 1.00:00:00
User               :
Id                 : 3
Enabled            : True
JobDefinition      : Microsoft.PowerShell.ScheduledJob.ScheduledJobDefinition
```

The commands in this example changes the repetition interval of the *Once* job trigger of SecurityCheck scheduled job from every 60 minutes to every 90 minutes.
The SecurityCheck scheduled job has three job triggers, so the commands use the *TriggerId* parameter of the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet to identify the job trigger that is being changed.

The first command uses the **Get-JobTrigger** cmdlet to get all job triggers of the SecurityCheck scheduled job.
The output, which displays the IDs of the job triggers, reveals that the *Once* job trigger has an ID of 3.

## PARAMETERS

### -At
Starts the job at the specified date and time.
Enter a **DateTime** object, such as one that the Get-Date cmdlet returns, or a string that can be converted to a time, such as "April 19, 2012 15:00", "12/31/2013 9:00 PM", or "3am".

If you don't specify an element of the **DateTime** object, such as seconds, that element of the job trigger is not changed.
If the original job trigger didn't include a **DateTime** object and you omit an element, the job trigger is created with the corresponding element from the current date and time.

When using the *Once* parameter, set the value of the *At* parameter to a particular date and time.
Because the default date in a **DateTime** object is the current date, setting a time before the current time without an explicit date results in a job trigger for a time in the past.

**DateTime** objects, and strings that are converted to **DateTime** objects, are automatically adjusted to be compatible with the date and time formats selected for the local computer in Region and Language in Control Panel.

```yaml
Type: DateTime
Parameter Sets: (All)

```

### -Daily
Specifies a recurring daily job schedule.
Use the other parameters in the *Daily* parameter set to specify the schedule details.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DaysInterval
Specifies the number of days between occurrences on a daily schedule.
For example, a value of 3 starts the scheduled job on days 1, 4, 7 and so on.
The default value is 1.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DaysOfWeek
Specifies the days of the week on which a weekly scheduled job runs.
Enter day names, such as Monday, Thursday, integers 0-6, where 0 represents Sunday, or an asterisk (*) to represent every day.
This parameter is required in the Weekly parameter set.

Day names are converted to their integer values in the job trigger.
When you enclose day names in quotation marks in a command, enclose each day name in separate quotation marks, such as "Monday", "Tuesday".
If you enclose multiple day names in a single quotation mark pair, the corresponding integer values are summed.
For example, "Monday, Tuesday" (1, 2) results in a value of "Wednesday" (3).

```yaml
Type: DayOfWeek[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InputObject
Specifies the job triggers.
Enter a variable that contains **ScheduledJobTrigger** objects or type a command or expression that gets **ScheduledJobTrigger** objects, such as a Get-JobTrigger command.
You can also pipe a **ScheduledJobTrigger** object to **Set-JobTrigger**.

If you specify multiple job triggers, **Set-JobTrigger** makes the same changes to all job triggers.

```yaml
Type: ScheduledJobTrigger[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Once
Specifies a non-recurring (one time) schedule.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PassThru
Returns the job triggers that changed.
By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RandomDelay
Enables a random delay that begins at the scheduled start time, and sets the maximum delay value.
The length of the delay is set pseudo-randomly for each start and varies from no delay to the time specified by the value of this parameter.
The default value, zero (00:00:00), disables the random delay.

Enter a timespan object, such as one returned by the New-TimeSpan cmdlet, or enter a value in \<hours\>:\<minutes\>:\<seconds\> format, which is automatically converted to a timespan object.

```yaml
Type: TimeSpan
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RepeatIndefinitely
This parameter, available starting in Windows PowerShell 4.0, eliminates the necessity of specifying a **TimeSpan.MaxValue** value for the *RepetitionDuration* parameter to run a scheduled job repeatedly, for an indefinite period.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RepetitionDuration
Repeats the job until the specified time expires.
The repetition frequency is determined by the value of the *RepetitionInterval* parameter.
For example, if the value of **RepetitionInterval** is 5 minutes and the value of *RepetitionDuration* is 2 hours, the job is triggered every five minutes for two hours.

Enter a timespan object, such as one that the New-TimeSpan cmdlet returns or a string that can be converted to a timespan object, such as "1:05:30".

To run a job indefinitely, add the *RepeatIndefinitely* parameter instead.

To stop a job before the job trigger repetition duration expires, set the **RepetitionDuration** value to zero (0).

To change the repetition duration or repetition interval of a *Once* job trigger, the command must include both the **RepetitionInterval** and **RepetitionDuration** parameters.
To change the repetition duration or repetition intervals of other types of job triggers, the command must include the *Once*, *At*, *RepetitionInterval* and *RepetitionDuration* parameters.

```yaml
Type: TimeSpan
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RepetitionInterval
Repeats the job at the specified time interval.
For example, if the value of this parameter is 2 hours, the job is triggered every two hours.
The default value, 0, does not repeat the job.

Enter a timespan object, such as one that the New-TimeSpan cmdlet returns or a string that can be converted to a timespan object, such as "1:05:30".

To change the repetition duration or repetition interval of a **Once** job trigger, the command must include both the **RepetitionInterval** and **RepetitionDuration** parameters.
To change the repetition duration or repetition intervals of other types of job triggers, the command must include the **Once**, **At**, **RepetitionInterval** and **RepetitionDuration** parameters.

```yaml
Type: TimeSpan
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -User
Specifies the users who trigger an *AtLogon* start of a scheduled job.
Enter the name of a user in \<UserName\> or \<Domain\Username\> format or enter an asterisk (*) to represent all users.
The default value is all users.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Weekly
Specifies a recurring weekly job schedule.
Use the other parameters in the *Weekly* parameter set to specify the schedule details.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WeeksInterval
Specifies the number of weeks between occurrences on a weekly job schedule.
For example, a value of 3 starts the scheduled job on weeks 1, 4, 7 and so on.
The default value is 1.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose, -WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see about_CommonParameters (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### Microsoft.PowerShell.ScheduledJob.ScheduledJobTrigger
You can pipe multiple job triggers to **Set-JobTrigger**.

## OUTPUTS

### None or Microsoft.PowerShell.ScheduledJob.ScheduledJobTrigger
When you use the *Passthru* parameter, **Set-JobTrigger** returns the job triggers that were changed.
Otherwise, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

## NOTES
* Job triggers have a JobDefintion property that associates them with the scheduled job. When you change the job trigger of a scheduled job, the job is changed. You do not need to use a Set-ScheduledJob command to apply the changed trigger to the scheduled job.
