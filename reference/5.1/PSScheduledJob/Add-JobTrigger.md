# Add-JobTrigger

## SYNOPSIS
Adds job triggers to scheduled jobs.

## SYNTAX

### JobDefinition (Default)
```
Add-JobTrigger [-Trigger] <ScheduledJobTrigger[]> [-InputObject] <ScheduledJobDefinition[]>
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

### JobDefinitionId
```
Add-JobTrigger [-Trigger] <ScheduledJobTrigger[]> [-Id] <Int32[]> [<CommonParameters>]
```

### JobDefinitionName
```
Add-JobTrigger [-Trigger] <ScheduledJobTrigger[]> [-Name] <String[]> [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Add-JobTrigger** cmdlet adds job triggers to scheduled jobs.
You can use it to add multiple triggers to multiple scheduled jobs.

A job trigger starts a scheduled job on a one-time or recurring schedule or when an event occurs.

Use the *Trigger* parameter of **Add-JobTrigger** to identify the job triggers to add.
Use the *Name*, *ID*, or *InputObject* parameters of **Add-JobTrigger** to identify the scheduled job to which the triggers are added.

To create job triggers for the value of the *Trigger* parameter, use the New-JobTrigger cmdlet or use a hash table to specify the job trigger.

**Add-JobTrigger** is one of a collection of job scheduling cmdlets in the **PSScheduledJob** module that is included in Windows PowerShell.

For more information about Scheduled Jobs, see the About topics in the PSScheduledJob module.
Import the PSScheduledJob module and then type: `Get-Help about_Scheduled*` or see about_Scheduled_Jobs.

This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Add a job trigger to a scheduled job
```
PS C:\> $Daily = New-JobTrigger -Daily -At 3AMPS
PS C:\> Add-JobTrigger -Trigger $Daily -Name "TestJob"
```

These commands add the Daily job trigger to the TestJob scheduled job.

The first command uses the New-JobTrigger cmdlet to create a job trigger that starts a scheduled job every day at 3:00 a.m.
The command saves the job trigger in the $Daily variable.

The second command uses the **Add-JobTrigger** cmdlet to add the job trigger in the $Startup variable to the TestJob scheduled job.

### Example 2: Add a job trigger to several scheduled jobs
```
PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob | Add-JobTrigger -Trigger (New-JobTrigger -AtStartup)
```

This command adds an AtStartup job trigger to all scheduled jobs on the local computer.
It uses the Get-ScheduledJob to get all of the scheduled jobs on the computer.
It uses a pipeline operator (|) to send the jobs to the **Add-JobTrigger** cmdlet, which adds the job trigger to each of the scheduled jobs.
The value of the *Trigger* parameter is a New-JobTrigger command that creates the AtStartup job trigger.

### Example 3: Copy a job trigger
```
PS C:\> $T = Get-JobTrigger -Name "BackupArchives"
PS C:\> Add-JobTrigger -Name "TestBackup,BackupLogs" -Trigger $T
```

These commands copy the job trigger from the BackupArchives scheduled job and add it to the TestBackup and BackupLogs scheduled jobs.

The first command uses the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet to get the job trigger of the BackupArchives scheduled job.
The command saves the trigger in the $t variable.

The second command uses the **Add-JobTrigger** cmdlet to add the job trigger in $t to the TestBackup and BackupLogs scheduled jobs.
