### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Gets scheduled jobs on the local computer.
module: PSScheduledJob
notes: |-
  * Each scheduled job is saved in a subdirectory of the $home\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScheduledJobs directory on the local computer. The subdirectory is named for the scheduled job and contains the XML file for the scheduled job and records of its execution history. For more information about scheduled jobs on disk, see about_Scheduled_Jobs_Advanced.
  * Scheduled jobs that you create in Windows PowerShell appear in Task Scheduler in the Task Scheduler Library\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScheduledJobs folder. You can use Task Scheduler to view and edit the scheduled job.
  * You can use Task Scheduler, the SchTasks.exe command-line tool, and the Task Scheduler cmdlets to manage scheduled jobs that you create with the Scheduled Job cmdlets. However, you cannot use the Scheduled Job cmdlets to manage tasks that you create in Task Scheduler.

  The **Get-ScheduledJob** cmdlet gets scheduled jobs on the local computer.
  **Get-ScheduledJob** gets only scheduled jobs that are created by the current user using the Register-ScheduledJob cmdlet.

  Although jobs that are created by using the **Register-ScheduledJob** cmdlet appear in Task Scheduler, **Get-ScheduledJob** gets only scheduled jobs.
  It does not get scheduled tasks created in Task Scheduler.

  Without parameters, **Get-ScheduledJob** gets all scheduled jobs on the computer.
  You can use the parameters of **Get-ScheduledJob** to get scheduled jobs by ID or name and examine them or pipe them to other cmdlets.

  **Get-ScheduledJob** is one of a collection of job scheduling cmdlets in the **PSScheduledJob** module that is included in Windows PowerShell.
