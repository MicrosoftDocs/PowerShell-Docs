## DESCRIPTION
The **Set-ScheduledJob** cmdlet changes the properties of scheduled jobs, such as the commands that the jobs run or the credentials required to run the job.
You can also use it to clear the execution history of the scheduled job.

To use this cmdlet, begin by using the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get the scheduled job.
Then, pipe the scheduled job to **Set-ScheduledJob** or save the job in a variable and use the *InputObject* parameter to identify the job.
Use the remaining parameters of **Set-ScheduledJob** to change the job properties or clear the execution history.

Although you can use **Set-ScheduledJob** to change the triggers and options of a scheduled job, the Add-JobTrigger, Set-JobTrigger, and Set-ScheduledJobOption cmdlets provide much easier ways to accomplish those tasks.
To create a new scheduled job, use the Register-ScheduledJob cmdlet.

The *Trigger* parameter of **Set-ScheduledJob** adds one or more job triggers that start the job.
The *Trigger* parameter is optional, so you can add triggers when you create the scheduled job, add job triggers later, add the *RunNow* parameter to start the job immediately, use the Start-Job cmdlet to start the job immediately at any time, or save the untriggered scheduled job as a template for other jobs.

**Set-ScheduledJob** is one of a collection of job scheduling cmdlets in the PSScheduledJob module that is included in Windows PowerShell.

For more information about Scheduled Jobs, see the About topics in the PSScheduledJob module.
Import the PSScheduledJob module and then type: `Get-Help about_Scheduled*` or see about_Scheduled_Jobs.

This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Change the script that a job runs
```
PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob -Name "Inventory"
Id         Name            Triggers        Command                                  Enabled
--         ----            --------        -------                                  -------
1          Inventory       {1}             C:\Scripts\Get-Inventory.ps1             True

The second command uses the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get the Inventory scheduled job. A pipeline operator (|) sends the scheduled job to the **Set-ScheduledJob** cmdlet. The **Set-ScheduledJob** cmdlet uses the *Script* parameter to specify a new script, Get-FullInventory.ps1. The command uses the *Passthru* parameter to return the scheduled job after the change.
PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob -Name "Inventory" | Set-ScheduledJob -FilePath "C:\Scripts\Get-FullInventory.ps1" -Passthru
Id         Name            Triggers        Command                                  Enabled
--         ----            --------        -------                                  -------
1          Inventory       {1}             C:\Scripts\Get-FullInventory.ps1         True
```

This example shows how to change the script that is run in a scheduled job.

The first command uses the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get the Inventory scheduled job.
The output shows that the job runs the Get-Inventory.ps1 script.

This command is not required; it is included only to show the effect of the script change.

### Example 2: Delete the execution history of a scheduled job
```
PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob BackupArchive | Set-ScheduledJob -ClearExecutionHistory
```

This command deletes the current execution history and saved job results for the BackupArchive scheduled job.

The command uses the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get the BackupArchive scheduled job.
A pipeline operator (|) sends the job to the **Set-ScheduledJob** cmdlet to change it.
The **Set-ScheduledJob** cmdlet uses the *ClearExecutionHistory* parameter to delete the execution history and saved results.

For more information about the execution history and saved job results of scheduled jobs, see about_Scheduled_Jobs.

### Example 3: Change scheduled jobs on a remote computer
```
PS C:\> Invoke-Command -Computer "Server01, Server02" -ScriptBlock {Get-ScheduledJob | Set-ScheduledJob -InitializationScript \\SrvA\Scripts\SetForRun.ps1}
```

This command changes the initialization script in all scheduled jobs on the Server01 and Server02 computers.

The command uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a command on the Server01 and Server02 computers.

The remote command begins with a Get-ScheduledJob command that gets all scheduled jobs on the computer.
The scheduled jobs are piped to the **Set-ScheduledJob** cmdlet, which changes the initialization script to SetForRun.ps1.

## PARAMETERS

### -ArgumentList
Specifies values for the parameters of the script that is specified by the *FilePath* parameter or for the command that is specified by the *ScriptBlock* parameter.

```yaml
Type: Object[]
Parameter Sets: ScriptBlock, FilePath
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Authentication
Specifies the mechanism that is used to authenticate the user's credentials.
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- Default
- Basic
- Credssp
- Digest
- Kerberos
- Negotiate
- NegotiateWithImplicitCredential

The default value is Default.
For more information about the values of this parameter, see [AuthenticationMechanism Enumeration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.management.automation.runspaces.authenticationmechanism) in the MSDN library.

Caution: Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) authentication, in which the user's credentials are passed to a remote computer to be authenticated, is designed for commands that require authentication on more than one resource, such as accessing a remote network share.
This mechanism increases the security risk of the remote operation.
If the remote computer is compromised, the credentials that are passed to it can be used to control the network session.

```yaml
Type: AuthenticationMechanism
Parameter Sets: ScriptBlock, FilePath
Aliases:
Accepted values: Default, Basic, Negotiate, NegotiateWithImplicitCredential, Credssp, Digest, Kerberos

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ClearExecutionHistory
Deletes the current execution history and the saved results of the scheduled job.

The job execution history and job results are saved with the scheduled job in the $home\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScheduledJobs directory on the computer on which the job is created.
To see the execution history, use the Get-Job cmdlet.
To get the job results, use the Receive-Job cmdlet.

This parameter does not affect the events that Task Scheduler writes to the Windows event logs and it does not stop Windows PowerShell from saving job results.
To manage the number of job results that are saved, use the *MaxResultCount* parameter.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: Execution
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential
Specifies a user account that has permission to run the scheduled job.
The default is the current user.

Type a user name, such as User01 or Domain01\User01, or enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one from the Get-Credential cmdlet.
If you enter only a user name, you will be prompted for a password.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: ScriptBlock, FilePath
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -FilePath
Specifies a script that the scheduled job runs.
Enter the path to a .ps1 file on the local computer.
To specify default values for the script parameters, use the *ArgumentList* parameter.
Every scheduled job must have either a *ScriptBlock* or *FilePath* value.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: FilePath
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InitializationScript
Specifies the fully qualified path to a Windows PowerShell script (.ps1).
The initialization script runs in the session that is created for the background job before the commands that are specified by the *ScriptBlock* parameter or the script that is specified by the *FilePath* parameter.
You can use the initialization script to configure the session, such as adding files, functions, or aliases, creating directories, or checking for prerequisites.

To specify a script that runs the primary job commands, use the *FilePath* parameter.

If the initialization script generates an error, including a non-terminating error, the current instance of the scheduled job does not run and its status is Failed.

```yaml
Type: ScriptBlock
Parameter Sets: ScriptBlock, FilePath
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InputObject
Specifies the scheduled job to be changed.
Enter a variable that contains **ScheduledJobDefinition** objects or type a command or expression that gets **ScheduledJobDefinition** objects, such as a Get-ScheduledJob command.
You can also pipe a **ScheduledJobDefinition** object to **Set-ScheduledJob**.

If you specify multiple scheduled jobs, **Set-ScheduledJob** makes the same changes to all jobs.

```yaml
Type: ScheduledJobDefinition
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MaxResultCount
Specifies how many job result entries are maintained for the scheduled job.
The default value is 32.

Windows PowerShell saves the execution history and results of each triggered instance of the scheduled job on disk.
The value of this parameter determines the number of job instance results that are saved for this scheduled job.
When the number of job instance results exceeds this value, Windows PowerShell deletes the results of the oldest job instance to make room for the results of the newest job instance.

The job execution history and job results are saved in the $home\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScheduledJobs\\\<JobName\>\Output\\\<Timestamp\> directories on the computer on which the job is created.
To see the execution history, use the Get-Job cmdlet.
To get the job results, use the Receive-Job cmdlet.

The *MaxResultCount* parameter sets the value of the ExecutionHistoryLength property of the scheduled job.

To delete the current execution history and job results, use the *ClearExecutionHistory* parameter.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: ScriptBlock, FilePath
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Name
Specifies a new name for the scheduled job and instances of the scheduled job.
The name must be unique on the local computer.

To identify the scheduled job to be changed, use the *InputObject* parameter or pipe a scheduled job from Get-ScheduledJob to **Set-ScheduledJob**.

This parameter does not change the names of job instances on disk.
It affects only job instances that are started after this command completes.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: ScriptBlock, FilePath
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PassThru
Returns an object representing the item with which you are working.
By default, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RunAs32
Runs the scheduled job in a 32-bit process.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: ScriptBlock, FilePath
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RunEvery

```yaml
Type: TimeSpan
Parameter Sets: ScriptBlock, FilePath
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -RunNow
Starts a job immediately, as soon as the **Set-ScheduledJob** cmdlet is run.
This parameter eliminates the need to trigger Task Scheduler to run a Windows PowerShell script immediately after registration, and does not require users to create a trigger that specifies a starting date and time.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: ScriptBlock, FilePath
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ScheduledJobOption
Sets options for the scheduled job.
Enter a **ScheduledJobOptions** object, such as one that you create by using the New-ScheduledJobOption cmdlet, or a hash table value.

You can set options for a scheduled job when you register the scheduled job or use the Set-ScheduledJobOption or **Set-ScheduledJob** cmdlets to set or change options.

Many of the options and their default values determine whether and when a scheduled job runs.
Be sure to review these options before scheduling a job.
For a description of the scheduled job options, including the default values, see New-ScheduledJobOption.

To submit a hash table, use the following keys.
In the following hash table, the keys are shown with their default values.

`@{# Power SettingsStartIfOnBattery=$False;StopIfGoingOnBattery=$True; WakeToRun=$False; # Idle SettingsStartIfNotIdle=$False; IdleDuration="00:10:00"; IdleTimeout="01:00:00"; StopIfGoingOffIdle=$True; RestartOnIdleResume=$False;# Security settingsShowInTaskScheduler=$TrueRunElevated=$False;# MiscRunWithoutNetwork=$False;DoNotAllowDemandStart=$False;MultipleInstancePolicy=IgnoreNew# Can be IgnoreNew, Parallel, Queue, StopExisting}`

```yaml
Type: ScheduledJobOptions
Parameter Sets: ScriptBlock, FilePath
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ScriptBlock
Specifies the commands that the scheduled job runs.
Enclose the commands in braces ( { } ) to create a script block.
To specify default values for command parameters, use the *ArgumentList* parameter.

Every Register-ScheduledJob command must use either the *ScriptBlock* or *FilePath* parameters.

```yaml
Type: ScriptBlock
Parameter Sets: ScriptBlock
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Trigger
Specifies the triggers for the scheduled job.
Enter one or more **ScheduledJobTrigger** objects, such as the objects that the New-JobTrigger cmdlet returns, or a hash table of job trigger keys and values.

A job trigger starts a scheduled job automatically on a one-time or recurring scheduled or when an event occurs.

Job triggers are optional.
You can add a trigger when you create the scheduled job, use the Add-JobTrigger or **Set-ScheduledJob** cmdlets to add triggers later, or use the Start-Job cmdlet to start the scheduled job immediately.
You can also create and maintain a scheduled job that has no job triggers.

To submit a hash table, use the following keys.

`@{Frequency="Once" (or Daily, Weekly, AtStartup, AtLogon);At="3am"` (or any valid time string);
`DaysOfWeek="Monday", "Wednesday"` (or any combination of day names);
`Interval=2` (or any valid frequency interval);
`RandomDelay="30minutes"` (or any valid timespan string);
`User="Domain1\User01"` (or any valid user; used only with the AtLogon frequency value)

}

```yaml
Type: ScheduledJobTrigger[]
Parameter Sets: ScriptBlock, FilePath
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
