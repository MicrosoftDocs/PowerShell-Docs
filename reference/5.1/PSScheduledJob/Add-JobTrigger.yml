examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Add a job trigger to a scheduled job'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $Daily = New-JobTrigger -Daily -At 3AMPS
    PS C:\> Add-JobTrigger -Trigger $Daily -Name "TestJob"
  description: |-
    These commands add the Daily job trigger to the TestJob scheduled job.

    The first command uses the New-JobTrigger cmdlet to create a job trigger that starts a scheduled job every day at 3:00 a.m.
    The command saves the job trigger in the $Daily variable.

    The second command uses the **Add-JobTrigger** cmdlet to add the job trigger in the $Startup variable to the TestJob scheduled job.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Add a job trigger to several scheduled jobs'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob | Add-JobTrigger -Trigger (New-JobTrigger -AtStartup)
  description: |-
    This command adds an AtStartup job trigger to all scheduled jobs on the local computer.
    It uses the Get-ScheduledJob to get all of the scheduled jobs on the computer.
    It uses a pipeline operator (|) to send the jobs to the **Add-JobTrigger** cmdlet, which adds the job trigger to each of the scheduled jobs.
    The value of the *Trigger* parameter is a New-JobTrigger command that creates the AtStartup job trigger.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 3: Copy a job trigger'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $T = Get-JobTrigger -Name "BackupArchives"
    PS C:\> Add-JobTrigger -Name "TestBackup,BackupLogs" -Trigger $T
  description: |-
    These commands copy the job trigger from the BackupArchives scheduled job and add it to the TestBackup and BackupLogs scheduled jobs.

    The first command uses the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet to get the job trigger of the BackupArchives scheduled job.
    The command saves the trigger in the $t variable.

    The second command uses the **Add-JobTrigger** cmdlet to add the job trigger in $t to the TestBackup and BackupLogs scheduled jobs.

  The **Add-JobTrigger** cmdlet adds job triggers to scheduled jobs.
  You can use it to add multiple triggers to multiple scheduled jobs.

  A job trigger starts a scheduled job on a one-time or recurring schedule or when an event occurs.

  Use the *Trigger* parameter of **Add-JobTrigger** to identify the job triggers to add.
  Use the *Name*, *ID*, or *InputObject* parameters of **Add-JobTrigger** to identify the scheduled job to which the triggers are added.

  To create job triggers for the value of the *Trigger* parameter, use the New-JobTrigger cmdlet or use a hash table to specify the job trigger.

  **Add-JobTrigger** is one of a collection of job scheduling cmdlets in the **PSScheduledJob** module that is included in Windows PowerShell.

  For more information about Scheduled Jobs, see the About topics in the PSScheduledJob module.
  Import the PSScheduledJob module and then type: `Get-Help about_Scheduled*` or see about_Scheduled_Jobs.

  This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.
