  description: |-
    This command disables all scheduled jobs on the local computer.
    It uses the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get all scheduled job and the **Disable-ScheduledJob** cmdlet to disable them.

    You can re-enable scheduled job by using the Enable-ScheduledJob cmdlet and run a disabled scheduled job by using the Start-Job cmdlet.

    **Disable-ScheduledJob** does not generate warnings or errors if you disable a scheduled job that is already disabled, so you can disable all scheduled jobs without conditions.

- title: 'Example 3: Disable selected scheduled jobs'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob | Where-Object {!$_.Credential} | Disable-ScheduledJob
  description: |-
    This command disables scheduled job do not include a credential.
    Jobs without credentials run with the permission of the user who created them.

    The command uses the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get all scheduled jobs on the computer.
    A pipeline operator sends the scheduled jobs to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects scheduled jobs that do not have credentials.
    The command uses the not (!) operator and references the Credential property of the scheduled job.
    Another pipeline operator sends the selected scheduled jobs to the **Disable-ScheduledJob** cmdlet, which disables them.

  code: |-
    PS C:\> Invoke-Command -ComputerName Srv01, Srv10 -ScriptBlock {Disable-ScheduledJob -Name TestJob}
  description: |-
    This command disables the TestJob scheduled job on two remote computers, Srv01 and Srv10.

    The command uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a **Disable-ScheduledJob** command on the Srv01 and Srv10 computers.
    The command uses the *Name* parameter of **Disable-ScheduledJob** to select the TestJob scheduled job on each computer.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 5: Disable a scheduled job by its global ID'
  code: |-
    The first command demonstrates one way of finding the GlobalID of a scheduled job. The command uses the Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get the scheduled jobs on the computer. A pipeline operator (|) sends the scheduled jobs to the Format-Table cmdlet, which displays the Name, GlobalID, and Command properties of each job in a table.
    PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob | Format-Table -Property Name, GlobalID, Command -Autosize
    Name             GlobalId                             Command
    ----             --------                             -------

    Test-HelpFiles   2f1606d2-c6cf-4bef-8b1c-ae36a9cc9934 .\Test-DomainHelpFiles.ps1

    The second command uses the  Get-ScheduledJob cmdlet to get the scheduled jobs on the computer. A pipeline operator (|) sends the scheduled jobs to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects the scheduled job with the specified global ID. Another pipeline operator sends the job to the **Disable-ScheduledJob** cmdlet, which disables it.
    PS C:\> Get-ScheduledJob | Where-Object {$_.GlobalID = d77020ca-f20d-42be-86c8-fc64df97db90} | Disable-ScheduledJob
  description: |-
    This examples shows how to disable a scheduled job by using its global identifier.
    The value of the GlobalID property of a scheduled job is a unique identifier (GUID).
    Use the GlobalID value when precision is required, such as when you are disabling scheduled jobs on multiple computers.

description: |-
  The **Disable-ScheduledJob** cmdlet temporarily disables scheduled jobs.
  Disabling preserves all job properties and does not disable the job triggers, but it prevents the scheduled jobs from starting automatically when triggered.
  You can start a disabled scheduled job by using the Start-Job cmdlet or use a disabled scheduled job as a template.

  To disable a scheduled job, the **Disable-ScheduledJob** cmdlet sets the **Enabled** property of the scheduled job to False ($false).
  To re-enable the scheduled job, use the Enable-ScheduledJob cmdlet.

  **Disable-ScheduledJob** is one of a collection of job scheduling cmdlets in the **PSScheduledJob** module that is included in Windows PowerShell.

  For more information about Scheduled Jobs, see the About topics in the PSScheduledJob module.
  Import the PSScheduledJob module and then type: `Get-Help about_Scheduled*` or see about_Scheduled_Jobs.

  This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.
