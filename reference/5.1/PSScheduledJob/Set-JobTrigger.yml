### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Changes the job trigger of a scheduled job.
module: PSScheduledJob
notes: |-
  * Job triggers have a JobDefintion property that associates them with the scheduled job. When you change the job trigger of a scheduled job, the job is changed. You do not need to use a Set-ScheduledJob command to apply the changed trigger to the scheduled job.
inputs:
- name: <xref href="Microsoft.PowerShell.ScheduledJob.ScheduledJobTrigger" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    You can pipe multiple job triggers to **Set-JobTrigger**.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="None or Microsoft.PowerShell.ScheduledJob.ScheduledJobTrigger" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    When you use the *Passthru* parameter, **Set-JobTrigger** returns the job triggers that were changed.
    Otherwise, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

- title: 'Example 1: Change the days in a job trigger'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-JobTrigger -Name "DeployPackage"
    Id         Frequency       Time                   DaysOfWeek              Enabled

    1          Weekly          9/29/2011 12:00:00 AM  {Wednesday, Saturday}   True

    The second command uses the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet to get the job trigger of the DeployPackage scheduled job. A pipeline operator (|) sends the trigger to the **Set-JobTrigger** cmdlet, which changes the job trigger so that it starts the DeployPackage job on Wednesdays and Sundays. The command uses the *Passthru* parameter to return the trigger after the change.
    PS C:\> Get-JobTrigger -Name "DeployPackage" | Set-JobTrigger -DaysOfWeek "Wednesday", "Sunday" -Passthru
    Id         Frequency       Time                   DaysOfWeek              Enabled
    --         ---------       ----                   ----------              -------

  description: |-
    This example shows how to change the days in a weekly job trigger.

    The first command uses the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet to get the job trigger of the DeployPackage scheduled job.
    The output shows that the trigger starts the job at midnight on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

    This command is not required; it is included only to show the effect of the trigger change.

    The second command uses the **Get-JobTrigger** cmdlet to get the *AtStartup* job trigger of the Inventory job. The command uses the *TriggerID* parameter to identify the job trigger. A pipeline operator (|) sends the job trigger to the **Set-JobTrigger** cmdlet, which changes it to a weekly job trigger that runs every four weeks on Monday at midnight. The command uses the *Passthru* parameter to return the trigger after the change.
    PS C:\> Get-JobTrigger -Name "Inventory" -TriggerID 2 | Set-JobTrigger -Weekly -WeeksInterval 4 -DaysOfWeek Monday -At "12:00 AM"

    This example shows how to change the type of job trigger that starts a job.
    The commands in this example replace an AtStartup job trigger with a weekly trigger.

    The first command uses the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet to get the job trigger of the Inventory scheduled job.
    The output shows that the job has two triggers a daily trigger and an *AtStartup* trigger.

    This command is not required; it is included only to show the effect of the trigger change.

- title: 'Example 3: Change the user on a remote job trigger'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Invoke-Command -ComputerName "Server01" -ScriptBlock {Get-ScheduledJob | Get-JobTrigger | Where-Object {$_.User} | Set-JobTrigger -User "Domain01/Admin02"}
  description: |-
    This command changes the user in all *AtLogon* job triggers of scheduled jobs on the Server01 computer.

    The command uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a command on the Server01 computer.

    The remote command begins with a Get-ScheduledJob command that gets all scheduled jobs on the computer.
    The scheduled jobs are piped to the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet, which gets the job triggers of the scheduled jobs.
    Each job trigger contains a JobDefinition property that contains the scheduled job, so the trigger remains associated with the scheduled job even when it is changed.

    The job triggers are piped to the Where-Object cmdlet, which gets job triggers that have the User property.
    The selected job triggers are piped to the **Set-JobTrigger** cmdlet, which changes the user to Domain01\Admin02.

    The second command uses the **TriggerID** parameter of the **Get-JobTrigger** cmdlet to get the *Once* trigger of the SecurityCheck scheduled job. The command pipes the trigger to the Format-List cmdlet, which displays all of the properties of the *Once* job trigger.The output shows that the trigger starts the job once every hour (RepetitionInterval = 1 hour) for one day (RepetitionDuration = 1 day).
    PS C:\> Get-JobTrigger -Name "SecurityCheck" -TriggerID 3 | Format-List -Property *
    At                 : 4/24/2012 4:00:00 PM
    DaysOfWeek         :
    Interval           : 1
    Frequency          : Once

    Enabled            : True
    JobDefinition      : Microsoft.PowerShell.ScheduledJob.ScheduledJobDefinition

    The third command changes the repetition interval of the job trigger from one hour to 90 minutes. The command does not return any output.
    PS C:\> Get-JobTrigger -Name "SecurityCheck" -TriggerId 3 | Set-JobTrigger -RepetitionInterval (New-TimeSpan -Minutes 90)

    The fourth command displays the effect of the change.The output shows that the trigger starts the job once every 90 minutes (RepetitionInterval = 1 hour, 30 minutes) for one day (RepetitionDuration = 1 day).
    PS C:\> Get-JobTrigger -Name "SecurityCheck" -TriggerID 3 | Format-List -Property *
    At                 : 4/24/2012 4:00:00 PM

    Enabled            : True
    JobDefinition      : Microsoft.PowerShell.ScheduledJob.ScheduledJobDefinition
  description: |-
    The commands in this example changes the repetition interval of the *Once* job trigger of SecurityCheck scheduled job from every 60 minutes to every 90 minutes.
    The SecurityCheck scheduled job has three job triggers, so the commands use the *TriggerId* parameter of the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet to identify the job trigger that is being changed.

    The first command uses the **Get-JobTrigger** cmdlet to get all job triggers of the SecurityCheck scheduled job.
    The output, which displays the IDs of the job triggers, reveals that the *Once* job trigger has an ID of 3.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.DateTime" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: At
  description: |+
    Starts the job at the specified date and time.
    Enter a **DateTime** object, such as one that the Get-Date cmdlet returns, or a string that can be converted to a time, such as "April 19, 2012 15:00", "12/31/2013 9:00 PM", or "3am".

    If you don't specify an element of the **DateTime** object, such as seconds, that element of the job trigger is not changed.
    If the original job trigger didn't include a **DateTime** object and you omit an element, the job trigger is created with the corresponding element from the current date and time.

    When using the *Once* parameter, set the value of the *At* parameter to a particular date and time.
    Because the default date in a **DateTime** object is the current date, setting a time before the current time without an explicit date results in a job trigger for a time in the past.

    **DateTime** objects, and strings that are converted to **DateTime** objects, are automatically adjusted to be compatible with the date and time formats selected for the local computer in Region and Language in Control Panel.

  The **Set-JobTrigger** cmdlet changes the properties of the job triggers of scheduled jobs.
  You can use it to change the time or frequency at which the jobs start or to change from a time-based schedules to schedules that are triggered by a logon or startup.

  A job trigger defines a recurring schedule or conditions for starting a scheduled job.
  Although job triggers are not saved to disk, you can change the job triggers of scheduled jobs, which are saved to disk.

  To change a job trigger of a scheduled job, begin by using the Get-JobTrigger cmdlet to get the job trigger of a scheduled job.
  Then, pipe the trigger to **Set-JobTrigger** or save the trigger in a variable and use the *InputObject* parameter of **Set-JobTrigger** cmdlet to identify the trigger.
  Use the remaining parameters of **Set-JobTrigger** to change the job trigger.

  When you change the type of a job trigger, such as changing a job trigger from a daily or weekly trigger to an *AtLogon* trigger, the original trigger properties are deleted.
  However, if you change the values of the trigger, but not its type, such as changing the days in a weekly trigger, only the properties that you specify are changed.
  All other properties of the original job trigger are retained.

  **Set-JobTrigger** is one of a collection of job scheduling cmdlets in the PSScheduledJob module that is included in Windows PowerShell.

  For more information about Scheduled Jobs, see the About topics in the PSScheduledJob module.
  Import the PSScheduledJob module and then type: `Get-Help about_Scheduled*`  or see about_Scheduled_Jobs.

  This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.
