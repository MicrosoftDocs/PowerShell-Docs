description: |-
  The `Add-LocalGroupMember` cmdlet adds users or groups to a local security group. All the rights and
  permissions that are assigned to a group are assigned to all members of that group.

  Members of the Administrators group on a local computer have Full Control permissions on that
  computer. Limit the number of users in the Administrators group.

  If the computer is joined to a domain, you can add user accounts, computer accounts, and group
  accounts from that domain and from trusted domains to a local group.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the computer is joined to a domain and you try to add a local user that has the same name as a
  > member of the domain it adds the domain member.
