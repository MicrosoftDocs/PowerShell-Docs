    If the computer is configured for CredSSP, this is the output:

    `The machine is configured to allow delegating fresh credentials to the following target(s): wsman/server02.accounting.fabrikam.com`

  The **Get-WSManCredSSP** cmdlet gets the Credential Security Support Provider-related configuration of the client and the server.
  The output indicates whether Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) authentication is enabled or disabled.
  This cmdlet also displays configuration information for the **AllowFreshCredentials** policy of CredSSP.

  When you use CredSSP authentication, the user credentials are passed to a remote computer to be authenticated.
  This type of authentication is designed for commands that create a remote session from another remote session.
  For example, if you want to run a background job on a remote computer, use this kind of authentication.

  The cmdlet performs the following actions:

  - Gets the WS-Management CredSSP setting on the client (**\<localhost|computername\>\Client\Auth\CredSSP**).
  - Gets the Windows CredSSP policy setting **AllowFreshCredentials**.
  - Gets the WS-Management CredSSP setting on the server (**\<localhost|computername\>\Service\Auth\CredSSP**).

  Caution: CredSSP authentication delegates the user credentials from the local computer to a remote computer.
  This practice increases the security risk of the remote operation.
  If the remote computer is compromised, when credentials are passed to it, the credentials can be used to control the network session.
