The following table is a list of currently supported PowerShell releases and the versions of
Ubuntu they are supported on. These versions remain supported until either the version of
[PowerShell reaches end-of-support][lifecycle] or the version of
[Ubuntu reaches end-of-support][eol-ubuntu].

- The ![Supported][1] icon indicates that the version of the OS or PowerShell is still supported
- The ![Out of Support][4] icon indicates the version of PowerShell is no longer supported on that
  version of the OS
- The ![In Test][2] icon indicates that we haven't finished testing PowerShell on that OS
- The ![Not Supported][3] icon indicates that the version of the OS or PowerShell isn't supported
- When both the version of the OS and the version of PowerShell have a ![Supported][1] icon, that
  combination is supported
