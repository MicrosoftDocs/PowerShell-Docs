The following table is a list of currently supported versions of PowerShell and the versions of RHEL
they're supported on. These versions remain supported until either the version of
[PowerShell reaches end-of-support][lifecycle] or the version of
[RHEL reaches end-of-support][eol-rhel].

- The ![Supported][1] icon indicates that the version of the OS or PowerShell is still supported
- The ![Out of Support][4] icon indicates the version of PowerShell is no longer supported on that
  version of the OS
- The ![In Test][2] icon indicates that we haven't finished testing PowerShell on that OS
- The ![Not Supported][3] icon indicates that the version of the OS or PowerShell isn't supported
- When both the version of the OS and the version of PowerShell have a ![Supported][1] icon, that
  combination is supported
