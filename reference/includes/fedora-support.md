The following table is a list of currently supported PowerShell releases and the versions of Fedora
they're supported on. These versions remain supported until either the version of
[PowerShell reaches end-of-support][lifecycle] or the version of
[Fedora reaches end-of-life][eol-fedora].

- A &#x2714;&#xfe0f; indicates that the version of the OS or PowerShell is still supported
- A &#x274c; indicates that the version of the OS or PowerShell isn't supported
- A &#x2b55; indicates the version of PowerShell is no longer supported on that version of the OS
- When both the version of the OS and the version of PowerShell have &#x2714;&#xfe0f;, that
  combination is supported
