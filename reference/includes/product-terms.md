## Product terminology used in the documentation

The documentation for PowerShell consists of two types of content: cmdlet reference and conceptual
content. The cmdlet reference is version specific. You can switch versions from the drop-down menu
at the top-left of the page. The conceptual content does not change when you change versions. In
general, the concepts apply to all versions of PowerShell, unless the article calls out a specific
version.

- **PowerShell** - This is the default name we use for the product. When we use this name in the
  documentation we are talking about the product in general, or the specifically identified version.
- **Windows PowerShell** - PowerShell built on .NET Framework. Windows PowerShell ships only on
  Windows and requires the complete Framework. It is possible to run both PowerShell (core) and
  Windows PowerShell on the same Windows computer.
- **PowerShell (core)** - PowerShell built on .NET Core. Usage of the term _core_ is limited to
  cases where it's necessary to differentiate it from Windows PowerShell.
