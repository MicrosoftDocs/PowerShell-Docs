## Short description

Provides details about background jobs on local and remote computers.

## Detailed description

This topic explains the concept of a background job and provides technical
information about how background jobs work in PowerShell.

This topic is a supplement to the [about_Jobs][03], [about_Thread_Jobs][06],
and [about_Remote_Jobs][04] topics.

### About background jobs

A background job runs a command or expression asynchronously. It might run a
cmdlet, a function, a script, or any other command-based task. It's designed to
run commands that take an extended period of time, but you can use it to run
any command in the background.

When a synchronous command runs, the PowerShell command prompt is suppressed
until the command is complete. But a background job doesn't suppress the
PowerShell prompt. A command to start a background job returns a job object.
The prompt returns immediately so you can work on other tasks while the
background job runs.

However, when you start a background job, you don't get the results immediately
even if the job runs very quickly. The job object that's returned contains
useful information about the job, but it doesn't contain the job results. You
must run a separate command to get the job results. You can also run commands
to stop the job, to wait for the job to be completed, and to delete the job.

To make the timing of a background job independent of other commands, each
background job runs in its own PowerShell session. However, this can be a
temporary connection that's created only to run the job and is then destroyed,
or it can be a persistent **PSSession** that you can use to run several related
jobs or commands.

### Using the job cmdlets

Use a `Start-Job` command to start a background job on a local computer.
`Start-Job` returns a job object. You can also get objects representing the
jobs that were started on the local computer using the `Get-Job` cmdlet.

To get the job results, use a `Receive-Job` command. If the job isn't complete,
`Receive-Job` returns partial results. You can also use the `Wait-Job` cmdlet
to suppress the command prompt until one or all of the jobs that were started
in the session are complete.

To stop a background job, use the `Stop-Job` cmdlet. To delete a job, use the
`Remove-Job` cmdlet.

For more information about how the cmdlets work, see the Help topic for each
cmdlet, and see [about_Jobs][03].

### Starting background jobs on remote computers

You can create and manage background jobs on a local or remote computer. To run
a background job remotely, use the **AsJob** parameter of a cmdlet such as
`Invoke-Command`, or use the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet to run a `Start-Job`
command remotely. You can also start a background job in an interactive
session.

For more information about remote background jobs, see
[about_Remote_Jobs][04].

### Child jobs

Each background job consists of a parent job and one or more child jobs. In
jobs started using `Start-Job` or the **AsJob** parameter of `Invoke-Command`,
the parent job is an executive. It doesn't run any commands or return any
results. The commands are actually run by the child jobs. Jobs started using
other cmdlets might work differently.

The child jobs are stored in the **ChildJobs** property of the parent job
object. The **ChildJobs** property can contain one or many child job objects.
The child job objects have a **Name**, **Id**, and **InstanceId** that differ
from the parent job so that you can manage the parent and child jobs
individually or as a unit.

To get the parent and child jobs of a job, use the **IncludeChildJobs**
parameter of the `Get-Job` cmdlet. The **IncludeChildJob** parameter was
introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```powershell
Get-Job -IncludeChildJob
```

```Output
Id Name   PSJobTypeName State      HasMoreData   Location    Command
-- ----   ------------- -----      -----------   --------    -------
1  Job1   RemoteJob     Failed     True          localhost   Get-Process
2  Job2                 Completed  True          Server01    Get-Process
3  Job3                 Failed     False         localhost   Get-Process
```

To get the parent job and only the child jobs with a particular **State**
value, use the **ChildJobState** parameter of the `Get-Job` cmdlet. The
**ChildJobState** parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

```powershell
Get-Job -ChildJobState Failed
```

```Output
Id Name   PSJobTypeName State      HasMoreData   Location    Command
-- ----   ------------- -----      -----------   --------    -------
1  Job1   RemoteJob     Failed     True          localhost   Get-Process
3  Job3                 Failed     False         localhost   Get-Process
```

To get the child jobs of a job on all versions of PowerShell,
use the **ChildJob** property of the parent job.

```powershell
(Get-Job Job1).ChildJobs
```

```Output
Id Name   PSJobTypeName State      HasMoreData   Location    Command
-- ----   ------------- -----      -----------   --------    -------
2  Job2                 Completed  True          Server01    Get-Process
3  Job3                 Failed     False         localhost   Get-Process
```

You can also use a `Get-Job` command on the child job, as shown in the
following command:

```powershell
Get-Job Job3
```

```Output
Id Name   PSJobTypeName State      HasMoreData   Location    Command
-- ----   ------------- -----      -----------   --------    -------
3  Job3                 Failed     False         localhost   Get-Process
```

The configuration of the child job depends on the command that you use to
start the job.

- When you use `Start-Job` to start a job on a local computer, the job consists
  of an executive parent job and a child job that runs the command.

- When you use the **AsJob** parameter of `Invoke-Command` to start a job on
  one or more computers, the job consists of an executive parent job and a
  child job for each job run on each computer.

- When you use `Invoke-Command` to run a `Start-Job` command on one or more
  remote computers, the result is the same as a local command run on each
  remote computer. The command returns a job object for each computer. The job
  object consists of an executive parent job and one child job that runs the
  command.

The parent job represents all of the child jobs. When you manage a parent job,
you also manage the associated child jobs. For example, if you stop a parent
job, all child jobs are stopped. If you get the results of a parent job, you
get the results of all child jobs.

However, you can also manage child jobs individually. This is most useful when
you want to investigate a problem with a job or get the results of only one of
a number of child jobs started using the **AsJob** parameter of
`Invoke-Command`.

The following command uses the **AsJob** parameter of `Invoke-Command` to start
background jobs on the local computer and two remote computers. The command
saves the job in the `$j` variable.

```powershell
$invokeCommandSplat = @{
    ComputerName = 'localhost', 'Server01', 'Server02'
    ScriptBlock = {Get-Date}
    AsJob = $true
}
$j = Invoke-Command @invokeCommandSplat
```

When you display the Name and **ChildJob** properties of the job in `$j`, it
shows that the command returned a job object with three child jobs, one for
each computer.

```powershell
$j | Format-List Name, ChildJobs
```

```Output
Name      : Job3
ChildJobs : {Job4, Job5, Job6}
```

When you display the parent job, it shows that the job failed.

```powershell
$j
```

```Output
Id Name   PSJobTypeName State      HasMoreData   Location
-- ----   ------------- -----      -----------   --------
3  Job3   RemotingJob   Failed     False         localhost,Server...
```

But when you run a `Get-Job` command that gets the child jobs, the output
shows that only one child job failed.

```powershell
Get-Job -IncludeChildJobs
```

```Output
Id  Name   PSJobTypeName State      HasMoreData   Location    Command
--  ----   ------------- -----      -----------   --------    -------
3   Job3   RemotingJob   Failed     False         localhost,Server...
4   Job4                 Completed  True          localhost   Get-Date
5   Job5                 Failed     False         Server01    Get-Date
6   Job6                 Completed  True          Server02    Get-Date
```

To get the results of all child jobs, use the `Receive-Job` cmdlet to get the
results of the parent job. But you can also get the results of a particular
child job, as shown in the following command.

```powershell
Receive-Job -Name Job6 -Keep |
    Format-Table ComputerName, DateTime -AutoSize
```

```Output
ComputerName DateTime
------------ --------
Server02     Thursday, March 13, 2008 4:16:03 PM
```

The child jobs feature of PowerShell background jobs gives you
more control over the jobs that you run.

### Job types

PowerShell supports different types of jobs for different tasks. Beginning in
Windows PowerShell 3.0, developers can write "job source adapters" that add new
job types to PowerShell and include the job source adapters in modules. When
you import the module, you can use the new job type in your session. For
example, the PSScheduledJob module adds scheduled jobs and the PSWorkflow
module adds workflow jobs.

Custom jobs types might differ significantly from standard PowerShell
background jobs. For example, scheduled jobs are saved on disk; they don't
exist only in a particular session. Workflow jobs can be suspended and resumed.

The cmdlets that you use to manage custom jobs depend on the job type. For
some, you use the standard job cmdlets, such as `Get-Job` and `Start-Job`.
Others come with specialized cmdlets that manage only a particular type of job.
For detailed information about custom job types, see the help topics about the
job type.

To find the job type of a job, use the `Get-Job` cmdlet. `Get-Job` returns
different job objects for different types of jobs. The value of the
**PSJobTypeName** property of the job objects that `Get-Job` returns indicates
the job type.

The following list describes the built-in PowerShell job types.

- **BackgroundJob** - Started using the `Start-Job` cmdlet.
- **RemoteJob** - Started using the **AsJob** parameter of the `Invoke-Command`
  cmdlet.
- **CIMJob** - Started using the **AsJob** parameter of a cmdlet from a CDXML
  module.
- **WMIJob** - Started using the **AsJob** parameter of a cmdlet from a WMI
  module.
- **PSEventJob** - Created using`Register-ObjectEvent` and specifying an action
  with the **Action** parameter.

> [!NOTE]
> Before using the `Get-Job` cmdlet to get jobs of a particular type, verify
> that the module that adds the job type is imported into the current session.
> Otherwise, `Get-Job` can't get jobs of that type.

Windows PowerShell 5.1 includes the following additional job types.

- **PSWorkflowJob** - Started using the **AsJob** parameter of a workflow.
- **PSScheduledJob** - An instance of a scheduled job started by a job trigger.

These job types are only available in Windows PowerShell 5.1. The modules that
add these job types aren't compatible with PowerShell 6.0 and later.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [about_Scheduled_Jobs][01]
- [about_Workflows][02]

## Examples

The following commands create a local background job, a remote background job,
a workflow job, and a scheduled job. Then, it uses the `Get-Job` cmdlet to get
the jobs. `Get-Job` doesn't get the scheduled job, but it gets any started
instances of the scheduled job.

Start a background job on the local computer.

```powershell
PS> Start-Job -Name LocalData {Get-Process}

Id Name        PSJobTypeName   State   HasMoreData   Location   Command
-- ----        -------------   -----   -----------   --------   -------
2  LocalData   BackgroundJob   Running        True   localhost  Get-Process
```

Start a background job that runs on a remote computer.

```powershell
$invokeCommandSplat = @{
    ComputerName = 'Server01'
    AsJob = $true
    JobName = 'RemoteData'
    ScriptBlock = {Get-Process}
}
Invoke-Command @invokeCommandSplat
```

```Output
Id  Name        PSJobTypeName  State   HasMoreData   Location   Command
--  ----        -------------  -----   -----------   --------   -------
2   RemoteData  RemoteJob      Running        True   Server01   Get-Process
```
