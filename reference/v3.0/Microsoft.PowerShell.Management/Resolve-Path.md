# Resolve-Path
## SYNOPSIS
Resolves the wildcard characters in a path, and displays the path contents.

## SYNTAX

### UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_1
```
Resolve-Path [-Path] <String[]> [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-Relative] [-UseTransaction]
```

### UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
```
Resolve-Path [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-Relative] -LiteralPath <String[]> [-UseTransaction]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Resolve-Path cmdlet interprets the wildcard characters in a path and displays the items and containers at the location specified by the path, such as the files and folders or registry keys and subkeys.

## EXAMPLES

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------
```
PS C:\>resolve-path ~
C:\Users\User01
```

This command resolves the path represented by the tilde character (~), which represents the home path of a file system drive, such as C:.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------
```
PS C:\>resolve-path windows
C:\Windows
```

When run from the root of the C: drive, this command returns the path to the Windows directory in the C: drive.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 --------------------------
```
PS C:\>"C:\windows\*" | resolve-path
```

This command returns all of the directories in the C:\Windows directory.
The command uses a pipeline operator (|) to send a path string to Resolve-Path.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 --------------------------
```
PS C:\>resolve-path \\Server01\public
```

This command resolves a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path and returns the shares in the path.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 5 --------------------------
```
PS C:\>resolve-path c:\prog* -relative
..\Program Files
..\Program Files (x86)
..\programs.txt
```

This command returns relative paths for the directories at the root of the C: drive.

### -------------------------- EXAMPLE 6 --------------------------
```
PS C:\>resolve-path -literalPath test[xml]
```

This command resolves the path to the Test\[xml\] subdirectory of the current directory.
It uses the LiteralPath parameter to indicate that the brackets are not regular expression characters.

## PARAMETERS

### -Credential
Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
The default is the current user.

Type a user name, such as "User01" or "Domain01\User01".
Or, enter a PSCredential object, such as one generated by the Get-Credential cmdlet.
If you type a user name, you will be prompted for a password.

This parameter is not supported by any providers installed with Windows PowerShell.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: Current user
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -LiteralPath
Specifies the path to be resolved.
The value of LiteralPath is used exactly as it is typed.
No characters are interpreted as wildcards.
If the path includes escape characters, enclose it in single quotation marks.
Single quotation marks tell Windows PowerShell not to interpret any characters as escape sequences.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_2
Aliases: 

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: 
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue, ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Path
Specifies the Windows PowerShell path to resolve.
This parameter is required.
You can also pipe a path string to Resolve-Path.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: UNNAMED_PARAMETER_SET_1
Aliases: 

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: 
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue, ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Relative
Returns a relative path.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UseTransaction
Includes the command in the active transaction.
This parameter is valid only when a transaction is in progress.
For more information, see Includes the command in the active transaction.
This parameter is valid only when a transaction is in progress.
For more information, see

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

## INPUTS

### System.String
You can pipe a string that contains a path to Resolve-Path.

## OUTPUTS

### System.Management.Automation.PathInfo or System.String
If you use the Relative parameter, Resolve-Path returns a string that contains the resolved path.
Otherwise, it returns a PathInfo object.

## NOTES
* The cmdlets that contain the Path noun (the Path cmdlets) manipulate path names and return the names in a concise format that all Windows PowerShell providers can interpret. They are designed for use in programs and scripts where you want to display all or part of a path name in a particular format. Use them like you would use Dirname, Normpath, Realpath, Join, or other path manipulators.

  You can use the Path cmdlets with several providers, including the FileSystem, Registry, and Certificate providers.

  The Resolve-Path cmdlet is designed to work with the data exposed by any provider.
To list the providers available in your session, type "Get-PSProvider".
For more information, see about_Providers.
