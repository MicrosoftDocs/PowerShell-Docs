### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Hides the output instead of sending it down the pipeline or displaying it.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core
notes: |-
  * The cmdlets that contain the **Out** verb (the **Out** cmdlets) do not have parameters for names or file paths. To send data to an **Out** cmdlet, use a pipeline operator (|) to send the output of a PowerShell command to the cmdlet. You can also store data in a variable and use the *InputObject* parameter to pass the data to the cmdlet. For more information, see the examples.
  * **Out-Null** does not return any output objects. If you pipe the output of **Out-Null** to the Get-Member cmdlet, **Get-Member** reports that no objects have been specified.

    This command gets items in the current location/directory, but its output is not passed through
