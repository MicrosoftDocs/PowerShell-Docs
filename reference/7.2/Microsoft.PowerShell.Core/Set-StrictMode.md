# Set-StrictMode

## SYNOPSIS
Establishes and enforces coding rules in expressions, scripts, and script blocks.

## SYNTAX

### Version (Default)

```
Set-StrictMode -Version <Version> [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Off

```
Set-StrictMode [-Off] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Set-StrictMode` cmdlet configures strict mode for the current scope and all child scopes, and
turns it on and off. When strict mode is on, PowerShell generates a terminating error when the
content of an expression, script, or script block violates basic best-practice coding rules.

Use the **Version** parameter to determine which coding rules are enforced.

`Set-PSDebug -Strict` cmdlet turns on strict mode for the global scope. `Set-StrictMode` affects
only the current scope and its child scopes. Therefore, you can use it in a script or function to
override the setting inherited from the global scope.

When `Set-StrictMode` is off, PowerShell has the following behaviors:

- Uninitialized variables are assumed to have a value of 0 (zero) or `$Null`, depending on type
- References to non-existent properties return `$Null`
- Results of improper function syntax vary with the error conditions
- Attempting to retrieve a value using an invalid index in an array returns `$Null`

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Turn on strict mode as version 1.0

```powershell
# Strict mode is off by default.
$a -gt 5
```

```Output
False
```

```powershell
Set-StrictMode -Version 1.0
$a -gt 5
```

```Output
InvalidOperation: The variable '$a' cannot be retrieved because it has not been set.
```

With strict mode set to version 1.0, attempts to reference variables that are not initialized fail.

### Example 2: Turn on strict mode as version 2.0

```powershell
# Strict mode is off by default.
function add ($a, $b) {
    '$a = ' + $a
    '$b = ' + $b
    '$a+$b = ' + ($a + $b)
}
add 3 4
```

```Output
$a = 3
$b = 4
$a+$b = 7
```

```powershell
add(3,4)
```

```Output
$a = 3 4
$b =
$a+$b = 3 4
```

```powershell
Set-StrictMode -Version 2.0
add(3,4)
```

```Output
InvalidOperation: The function or command was called as if it were a method. Parameters should be separated by spaces. For information about parameters, see the about_Parameters Help topic.
```

```powershell
Set-StrictMode -Off
$string = "This is a string."
$null -eq $string.Month
```

```Output
True
```

```powershell
Set-StrictMode -Version 2.0
$string = "This is a string."
$null -eq $string.Month
```

```Output
PropertyNotFoundException: The property 'Month' cannot be found on this object. Verify that the property exists.
```

This command turns strict mode on and sets it to version 2.0. As a result, PowerShell returns an
error if you use method syntax, which uses parentheses and commas, for a function call or reference
uninitialized variables or non-existent properties.

The sample output shows the effect of version 2.0 strict mode.

Without version 2.0 strict mode, the "(3,4)" value is interpreted as a single array object to which
nothing is added. By using version 2.0 strict mode, it is correctly interpreted as faulty syntax for
submitting two values.

Without version 2.0, the reference to the non-existent **Month** property of a string returns only
`$Null`. By using version 2.0, it is interpreted correctly as a reference error.

### Example 3: Turn on strict mode as version 3.0

With strict mode set to **Off**, invalid or out of bounds indexes result return null values.

```powershell
# Strict mode is off by default.
$a = @(1)
$null -eq $a[2]
$null -eq $a['abc']
```

```Output
True
True
```

```powershell
Set-StrictMode -Version 3
$a = @(1)
$null -eq $a[2]
$null -eq $a['abc']
```

```Output
OperationStopped: Index was outside the bounds of the array.

InvalidArgument: Cannot convert value "abc" to type "System.Int32". Error: "Input string was not in a correct format."
```

With strict mode set to version 3 or higher, invalid or out of bounds indexes result in errors.

## PARAMETERS

### -Off

Indicates that this cmdlet turns strict mode off for the current scope and all child scopes.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: Off
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Version

Specifies the conditions that cause an error in strict mode. This parameter accepts any valid
PowerShell version number. Any number higher than 3 is treated as **Latest**.

The effective values for this parameter are:

- 1.0
  - Prohibits references to uninitialized variables, except for uninitialized variables in strings.
- 2.0
  - Prohibits references to uninitialized variables. This includes uninitialized variables in
    strings.
  - Prohibits references to non-existent properties of an object.
  - Prohibits function calls that use the syntax for calling methods.
- 3.0
  - Prohibits references to uninitialized variables. This includes uninitialized variables in
    strings.
  - Prohibits references to non-existent properties of an object.
  - Prohibits function calls that use the syntax for calling methods.
  - Prohibit out of bounds or unresolvable array indexes.
- Latest
  - Selects the latest version available. The latest version is the most strict. Use this value to
    make sure that scripts use the strictest available version, even when new versions are added to
    PowerShell.

> [!CAUTION]
> Using a **Version** of **Latest** in scripts. The meaning of **Latest** can change in new releases
> of PowerShell. Therefore, a script written for an older version of PowerShell that uses
> `Set-StrictMode -Version Latest` is subject to more restrictive rules when run in a newer version
> of PowerShell.

```yaml
Type: System.Version
Parameter Sets: Version
Aliases: v

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable,
-InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose,
-WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see
[about_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### None

You cannot pipe input to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### None

This cmdlet does not return any output.

## NOTES

While `Set-StrictMode` **Version** parameter will accept values greater than `3.0`, currently there
are no additional rules defined for anything higher than `3.0`.

`Set-StrictMode` is effective only in the scope in which it is set and in its child scopes. For
more information about scopes in PowerShell, see [about_Scopes](about/about_Scopes.md).
