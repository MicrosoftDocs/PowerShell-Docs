  description: |-
    These commands start and stop an interactive session with the Server01 computer that uses a
    PowerShell session (**PSSession**).

    Because the interactive session was started by using a PowerShell session, the **PSSession** is
    still available when the interactive session ends. If you use the _ComputerName_ parameter,
    `Enter-PSSession` creates a temporary session that it closes when the interactive session ends.

    The first command uses the `New-PSSession` cmdlet to create a **PSSession** on the Server01
    computer. The command saves the **PSSession** in the `$s` variable.

    The second command uses `Enter-PSSession` to start an interactive session using the **PSSession** in
    `$s`.

    The third command uses `Exit-PSSession` to stop the interactive session.

    The final command displays the **PSSession** in the `$s` variable. The **State** property shows the
    **PSSession** is still open and available for use.

  code: |-
    PS> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName Server01
    Server01\PS> exit
    PS>
  description: |-
    This example uses the `exit` keyword to stop an interactive session started by using
    `Enter-PSSession`. The `exit` keyword has the same effect as using `Exit-PSSession`.

uid: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core.Exit-PSSession
name: Exit-PSSession
description: |-
  The `Exit-PSSession` cmdlet ends interactive sessions that you started by using the
  `Enter-PSSession` cmdlet.

  You can also use the `exit` keyword to end an interactive session. The effect is the same as using
  `Exit-PSSession`.
