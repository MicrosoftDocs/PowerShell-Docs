### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Closes one or more PowerShell sessions (PSSessions).
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core
notes: |-
  * The *Id* parameter is mandatory. To delete all the **PSSessions** in the current session, type `Get-PSSession | Remove-PSSession`.
  * A **PSSession** uses a persistent connection to a remote computer. Create a **PSSession** to run a series of commands that share data. For more information, type `Get-Help about_PSSessions`.
  * **PSSessions** are specific to the current session. When you end a session, the **PSSessions** that you created in that session are forcibly closed.

  description: |-
    These commands show how to close a **PSSession** based on its instance ID, or **RemoteRunspaceID**.

    The first command uses the **Get-PSSession** cmdlet to get the **PSSessions** in the current session.
    It uses a pipeline operator (|) to send the **PSSessions** to the Format-Table cmdlet, which formats their **ComputerName** and **InstanceID** properties in a table.
    The *AutoSize* parameter compresses the columns for display.

    From the resulting display, you can identify the **PSSession** to be closed, and copy and paste the *InstanceID* of that **PSSession** into the second command.

    The second command uses the **Remove-PSSession** cmdlet to remove the *PSSession* with the specified instance ID.

  description: |-
    This function deletes all of the **PSSessions** in the current session.
    After you add this function to your PowerShell profile, to delete all sessions, type `EndPSS`.

  name: ComputerName
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of names of computers.
    This cmdlet closes the **PSSessions** that are connected to the specified computers.
    Wildcard characters are permitted.

    Type the NetBIOS name, an IP address, or a fully qualified domain name of one or more remote computers.
    To specify the local computer, type the computer name, localhost, or a dot (.).

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: Cn
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ContainerId
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of IDs of containers. This cmdlet removes sessions for each of the specified
    containers. Use the `docker ps` command to get a list of container IDs. For more information, see
    the help for the [docker ps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/) command.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Id
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of IDs of sessions.
    This cmdlet closes the *PSSessions* with the specified IDs.
    Type one or more IDs, separated by commas, or use the range operator (..) to specify a range of IDs.

    An ID is an integer that uniquely identifies the **PSSession** in the current session.
    It is easier to remember and type than the *InstanceId*, but it is unique only in the current session.
    To find the ID of a **PSSession**, run the Get-PSSession cmdlet without parameters.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Guid" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: InstanceId
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of instance IDs.
    This cmdlet closes the **PSSessions** that have the specified instance IDs.

    The instance ID is a GUID that uniquely identifies a **PSSession** in the current session.
    The instance ID is unique, even when you have multiple sessions running on a single computer.

    The instance ID is stored in the **InstanceID** property of the object that represents a **PSSession**.
    To find the **InstanceID** of the **PSSessions** in the current session, type `Get-PSSession | Format-Table Name, ComputerName, InstanceId`.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Name
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of friendly names of sessions.
    This cmdlet closes the **PSSessions** that have the specified friendly names.
    Wildcard characters are permitted.

    Because the friendly name of a **PSSession** might not be unique, when you use the *Name* parameter, consider also using the *WhatIf* or *Confirm* parameter in the **Remove-PSSession** command.

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.PSSession" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Session
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the session objects of the **PSSessions** to close.
    Enter a variable that contains the **PSSessions** or a command that creates or gets the **PSSessions**, such as a New-PSSession or **Get-PSSession** command.
    You can also pipe one or more session objects to **Remove-PSSession**.

  defaultValue: None

    Specifies an array of ID of virtual machines.
    This cmdlet starts an interactive session with each of the specified virtual machines.
    To see the virtual machines that are available to you, use the following command:

    `Get-VM | Select-Object -Property Name, ID`

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of names of virtual machines.
    This cmdlet starts an interactive session with each of the specified virtual machines.

description: |-
  The **Remove-PSSession** cmdlet closes PowerShell sessions (**PSSessions**) in the current session.
  It stops any commands that are running in the **PSSessions**, ends the **PSSession**, and releases the resources that the **PSSession** was using.
  If the **PSSession** is connected to a remote computer, this cmdlet also closes the connection between the local and remote computers.

  To remove a **PSSession**, enter the *Name*, *ComputerName*, *ID*, or *InstanceID* of the session.

  If you have saved the *PSSession* in a variable, the session object remains in the variable, but the state of the *PSSession* is Closed.
