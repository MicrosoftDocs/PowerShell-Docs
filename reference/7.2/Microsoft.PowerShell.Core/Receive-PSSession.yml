### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Gets results of commands in disconnected sessions
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core
notes: |-
  This cmdlet is only available on Windows platforms.

  `Receive-PSSession` gets results only from sessions that were disconnected. Only sessions that are
  connected to, or terminate at, computers that run PowerShell 3.0 or later versions can be
  disconnected and reconnected.

  If the commands that were running in the disconnected session didn't generate results or if the
  results were already returned to another session, `Receive-PSSession` doesn't generate any output.

  A session's output buffering mode determines how commands in the session manage output when the
  session is disconnected. When the value of the **OutputBufferingMode** option of the session is Drop
  and the output buffer is full, the command starts to delete output. `Receive-PSSession` can't
  recover this output. For more information about the output buffering mode option, see the help
  articles for the [New-PSSessionOption](New-PSSessionOption.yml) and
  [New-PSTransportOption](New-PSTransportOption.yml) cmdlets.

  You can't change the idle time-out value of a **PSSession** when you connect to the **PSSession** or
  receive results. The **SessionOption** parameter of `Receive-PSSession` takes a **SessionOption**
  object that has an **IdleTimeout** value. However, the **IdleTimeout** value of the
  **SessionOption** object and the **IdleTimeout** value of the `$PSSessionOption` variable are
  ignored when it connects to a **PSSession** or receiving results.

  - You can set and change the idle time-out of a **PSSession** when you create the **PSSession**, by
    using the `New-PSSession` or `Invoke-Command` cmdlets, and when you disconnect from the
    **PSSession**.
  - The **IdleTimeout** property of a **PSSession** is critical to disconnected sessions because it
    determines how long a disconnected session is maintained on the remote computer. Disconnected
    sessions are considered to be idle from the moment that they are disconnected, even if commands
    are running in the disconnected session.

  If you start a start a job in a remote session by using the **AsJob** parameter of the
  `Invoke-Command` cmdlet, the job object is created in the current session, even though the job runs
  in the remote session. If you disconnect the remote session, the job object in the current session
  is disconnected from the job. The job object contains any results that were returned to it, but
  doesn't receive new results from the job in the disconnected session.

  If a different client connects to the session that contains the running job, the results that were
  delivered to the original job object in the original session aren't available in the newly connected
  session. Only results that were not delivered to the original job object are available in the
  reconnected session.

  Similarly, if you start a script in a session and then disconnect from the session, any results that
  the script delivers to the session before disconnecting aren't available to another client that
  connects to the session.

  To prevent data loss in sessions that you intend to disconnect, use the **InDisconnectedSession**
  parameter of the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet. Because this parameter prevents results from being
  returned to the current session, all results are available when the session is reconnected.

  You can also prevent data loss by using the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet to run a `Start-Job` command in
  the remote session. In this case, the job object is created in the remote session. You can't use the
  `Receive-PSSession` cmdlet to get the job results. Instead, use the `Connect-PSSession` cmdlet to
  connect to the session and then use the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet to run a `Receive-Job` command in
  the session.

  When a session that contains a running job is disconnected and then reconnected, the original job
  object is reused only if the job is disconnected and reconnected to the same session, and the
  command to reconnect doesn't specify a new job name. If the session is reconnected to a different
  client session or a new job name is specified, PowerShell creates a new job object for the new
  session.

  When you disconnect a **PSSession**, the session state is Disconnected and the availability is None.

  - The value of the **State** property is relative to the current session. A value of Disconnected
    means that the **PSSession** isn't connected to the current session. However, it doesn't mean that
    the **PSSession** is disconnected from all sessions. It might be connected to a different session.
    To determine whether you can connect or reconnect to the session, use the **Availability**
    property.
  - An **Availability** value of None indicates that you can connect to the session. A value of Busy
    indicates that you can't connect to the **PSSession** because it's connected to another session.
  - For more information about the values of the **State** property of sessions, see
    [RunspaceState](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.runspaces.runspacestate).
  - For more information about the values of the **Availability** property of sessions, see
    [RunspaceAvailability](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.runspaces.runspaceavailability).

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Connect to a PSSession'
  code: |-
    Receive-PSSession -ComputerName Server01 -Name ITTask
  description: |-
    The `Receive-PSSession` specifies the remote computer with the **ComputerName** parameter. The
    **Name** parameter identifies the ITTask session on the Server01 computer. The example gets the
    results of commands that were running in the ITTask session.

    Because the command doesn't use the **OutTarget** parameter, the results appear on the command line.
  summary: |+
    This example connects to a session on a remote computer and gets the results of commands that are
    running in a session.

- title: 'Example 2: Get results of all commands on disconnected sessions'
  code: |-
    Get-PSSession -ComputerName Server01, Server02 | Receive-PSSession
  description: |-
    `Get-PSSession` uses the **ComputerName** parameter to specify the remote computers. The objects are
    sent down the pipeline to `Receive-PSSession`.
  summary: |+
    This example gets the results of all commands running in all disconnected sessions on two remote
    computers.

    If any session wasn't disconnected or isn't running commands, `Receive-PSSession` doesn't connect to
    the session and doesn't return any output or errors.

  description: |-
    The command uses the **ComputerName** and **Name** parameters to identify the disconnected session.
    It uses the **OutTarget** parameter with a value of Job to direct `Receive-PSSession` to return the
    results as a job. The **JobName** parameter specifies a name for the job in the reconnected session.
    The **Credential** parameter runs the `Receive-PSSession` command using the permissions of a domain
    administrator.

    The output shows that `Receive-PSSession` returned the results as a job in the current session. To
    get the job results, use a `Receive-Job` command
  summary: |+
    This example uses the `Receive-PSSession` cmdlet to get the results of a script that was running in
    a remote computer's session.

  description: |-
    The `New-PSSession` cmdlet creates a session on the Server01 computer and saves the session in the
    `$s` variable. The `$s` variable displays that the **State** is Opened and the **Availability** is
    Available. These values indicate that you're connected to the session and can run commands in the
    session.

    The `Invoke-Command` cmdlet runs a script in the session in the `$s` variable. The script begins to
    run and return data, but a network outage occurs that interrupts the session. The user has to exit
    the session and restart the local computer.

    When the computer restarts, the user starts PowerShell and runs a `Get-PSSession` command to get
    sessions on the Server01 computer. The output shows that the **AD** session still exists on the
    Server01 computer. The **State** indicates that the **AD** session is disconnected. The
    **Availability** value of None, indicates that the session isn't connected to any client sessions.

    The `Receive-PSSession` cmdlet reconnects to the **AD** session and gets the results of the script
    that ran in the session. The command uses the **OutTarget** parameter to request the results in a
    job named **ADJob**. The command returns a job object and the output indicates that the script is
    still running.

    The `Get-PSSession` cmdlet is used to check the job state. The output confirms that the
    `Receive-PSSession` cmdlet reconnected to the **AD** session, which is now open and available for
    commands. And, the script resumed execution and is getting the script results.
  summary: |+
    This example uses the `Receive-PSSession` cmdlet to get the results of a job after a network outage
    disrupts a session connection. PowerShell automatically attempts to reconnect the session once per
    second for the next four minutes and abandons the effort only if all attempts in the four-minute
    interval fail.

    The `Invoke-Command` cmdlet runs a script on three remote computers. Because the script gathers and
    summarizes data from multiple databases, it often takes the script an extended time to finish. The
    command uses the **InDisconnectedSession** parameter that starts the scripts and then immediately
    disconnects the sessions. The **SessionOption** parameter extends the **IdleTimeout** value of the
    disconnected session. Disconnected sessions are considered idle from the moment they're
    disconnected. It's important to set the idle time-out for long enough so that the commands can
    complete and you can reconnect to the session. You can set the **IdleTimeout** only when you create
    the **PSSession** and change it only when you disconnect from it. You can't change the
    **IdleTimeout** value when you connect to a **PSSession** or receiving its results. After running
    the command, the user exits PowerShell and closes the computer.

    The next day, the user resumes Windows, starts PowerShell, and uses `Get-PSSession` to get the
    sessions in which the scripts were running. The command identifies the sessions by the computer
    name, session name, and the name of the session configuration and saves the sessions in the `$s`
    variable. The value of the `$s` variable is displayed and shows that the sessions are disconnected,
    but aren't busy.

    The `Receive-PSSession` cmdlet connects to the sessions in the `$s` variable and gets their results.
    The command saves the results in the `$Results` variable. The `$s` variable is displayed and shows
    that the sessions are connected and available for commands.

    The script results in the `$Results` variable are displayed in the PowerShell console. If any of the
    results are unexpected, the user can run commands in the sessions to investigate the root cause.
  summary: |+
    This example uses the `Receive-PSSession` cmdlet to reconnect to sessions that were intentionally
    disconnected and get the results of jobs that were running in the sessions.

  description: |-
    The `New-PSSession` cmdlet creates the Test session on the Server01 computer. The command saves the
    session in the `$s` variable.

    The `Invoke-Command` cmdlet runs a command in the session in the `$s` variable. The command uses the
    **AsJob** parameter to run the command as a job and creates the job object in the current session.
    The command returns a job object that's saved in the `$j` variable. The `$j` variable displays the
    job object.

    The session object in the `$s` variable is sent down the pipeline to `Disconnect-PSSession` and the
    session is disconnected.

    The `$j` variable is displayed and shows the effect of disconnecting the job object in the `$j`
    variable. The job state is now Disconnected.

    The `Receive-Job` is run on the job in the `$j` variable. The output shows that the job began to
    return output before the session and the job were disconnected.

    The `Connect-PSSession` cmdlet is run in the same client session. The command reconnects to the Test
    session on the Server01 computer and saves the session in the `$s2` variable.

    The `Receive-PSSession` cmdlet gets the results of the job that was running in the session. Because
    the command is run in the same session, `Receive-PSSession` returns the results as a job by default
    and reuses the same job object. The command saves the job in the `$j2` variable. The `Receive-Job`
    cmdlet gets the results of the job in the `$j` variable.

  name: AllowRedirection
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet allows redirection of this connection to an alternate Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI).

    When you use the **ConnectionURI** parameter, the remote destination can return an instruction to
    redirect to a different URI. By default, PowerShell doesn't redirect connections, but you can use
    this parameter to enable it to redirect the connection.

    You can also limit the number of times the connection is redirected by changing the
    **MaximumConnectionRedirectionCount** session option value. Use the **MaximumRedirection** parameter
    of the `New-PSSessionOption` cmdlet or set the **MaximumConnectionRedirectionCount** property of the
    `$PSSessionOption` preference variable. The default value is 5.

    Wildcard characters aren't permitted. To specify the local computer, type the computer name, a dot
    (`.`), `$env:COMPUTERNAME`, or localhost.

  name: ConfigurationName
  description: |+
    Specifies the name of a session configuration. This cmdlet connects only to sessions that use the
    specified session configuration.

    Enter a configuration name or the fully qualified resource URI for a session configuration. If you
    specify only the configuration name, the following schema URI is prepended:

    `http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell`.

    The configuration name of a session is stored in the **ConfigurationName** property of the session.

    The parameter's value is used to select and filter sessions. It doesn't change the session
    configuration that the session uses.

    For more information about session configurations, see
    [about_Session_Configurations](./About/about_Session_Configurations.md).

- type: <xref href="System.Uri" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ConnectionUri
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies a URI that defines the connection endpoint that is used to reconnect to the disconnected
    session.

    The URI must be fully qualified. The string's format is as follows:

    `<Transport>://<ComputerName>:<Port>/<ApplicationName>`

    The default value is as follows:

    `http://localhost:5985/WSMAN`

    If you don't specify a connection URI, you can use the **UseSSL**, **ComputerName**, **Port**, and
    **ApplicationName** parameters to specify the connection URI values.

    Valid values for the **Transport** segment of the URI are HTTP and HTTPS. If you specify a
    connection URI with a Transport segment, but don't specify a port, the session is created with
    standard ports: 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. To use the default ports for PowerShell remoting,
    specify port 5985 for HTTP or 5986 for HTTPS.

    If the destination computer redirects the connection to a different URI, PowerShell prevents the
    redirection unless you use the **AllowRedirection** parameter in the command.

  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies a user account that has permission to connect to the disconnected session. The default is
    the current user.

    Type a user name, such as **User01** or **Domain01\User01**, or enter a **PSCredential** object
    generated by the `Get-Credential` cmdlet. If you type a user name, you're prompted to enter the
    password.

    Credentials are stored in a [PSCredential](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential)
    object and the password is stored as a [SecureString](/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring).

  name: Id
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the ID of a disconnected session. The **Id** parameter works only when the disconnected
    session was previously connected to the current session.

    This parameter is valid, but not effective, when the session is stored on the local computer, but
    wasn't connected to the current session.

  name: InstanceId
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the instance ID of the disconnected session. The instance ID is a GUID that uniquely
    identifies a **PSSession** on a local or remote computer. The instance ID is stored in the
    **InstanceID** property of the **PSSession**.

  defaultValue: None

- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: JobName
  description: |+
    Specifies a friendly name for the job that `Receive-PSSession` returns.

    `Receive-PSSession` returns a job when the value of the **OutTarget** parameter is Job or the job
    that's running in the disconnected session was started in the current session.

    If the job that's running in the disconnected session was started in the current session, PowerShell
    reuses the original job object in the session and ignores the value of the **JobName** parameter.

    If the job that's running in the disconnected session was started in a different session, PowerShell
    creates a new job object. It uses a default name, but you can use this parameter to change the name.

    If the default value or explicit value of the **OutTarget** parameter isn't Job, the command
    succeeds, but the **JobName** parameter has no effect.

  defaultValue: None

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.OutTarget" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: OutTarget
  description: |+
    Determines how the session results are returned. The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - **Job**. Returns the results asynchronously in a job object. You can use the **JobName** parameter
      to specify a name or new name for the job.
    - **Host**. Returns the results to the command line (synchronously). If the command is being resumed
      or the results consist of a large number of objects, the response might be delayed.

    The default value of the **OutTarget** parameter is Host. If the command that's being received in a
    disconnected session was started in the current session, the default value of the **OutTarget**
    parameter is the form in which the command was started. If the command was started as a job, by
    default, it's returned as a job. Otherwise, it's returned to the host program by default.

    Typically, the host program displays returned objects at the command line without delay, but this
    behavior can vary.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Default, Host, Job
- type: <xref href="System.Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Port
  description: |+
    Specifies the remote computer's network port that's used to reconnect to the session. To connect to
    a remote computer, it must be listening on the port that the connection uses. The default ports are
    5985, which is the WinRM port for HTTP, and 5986, which is the WinRM port for HTTPS.

    Before using an alternate port, you must configure the WinRM listener on the remote computer to
    listen on that port. To configure the listener, type the following two commands at the PowerShell
    prompt:

    `Remove-Item -Path WSMan:\Localhost\listener\listener* -Recurse`

    `New-Item -Path WSMan:\Localhost\listener -Transport http -Address * -Port \<port-number\>`

    Don't use the **Port** parameter unless it's necessary. The port that's set in the command applies
    to all computers or sessions on which the command runs. An alternate port setting might prevent the
    command from running on all computers.

  name: Session
  isRequired: true

    Specifies the disconnected session. Enter a variable that contains the **PSSession** or a command
    that creates or gets the **PSSession**, such as a `Get-PSSession` command.

  name: SessionOption
  description: |+
    Specifies advanced options for the session. Enter a **SessionOption** object, such as one that you
    create by using the `New-PSSessionOption` cmdlet, or a hash table in which the keys are session
    option names and the values are session option values.

    The default values for the options are determined by the value of the `$PSSessionOption` preference
    variable, if it's set. Otherwise, the default values are established by options set in the session
    configuration.

    The session option values take precedence over default values for sessions set in the
    `$PSSessionOption` preference variable and in the session configuration. However, they don't take
    precedence over maximum values, quotas, or limits set in the session configuration.

    For a description of the session options that includes the default values, see
    `New-PSSessionOption`. For information about the **$PSSessionOption** preference variable, see
    [about_Preference_Variables](./About/about_Preference_Variables.md). For more information about
    session configurations, see
    [about_Session_Configurations](./About/about_Session_Configurations.md).

  name: UseSSL
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to connect to the
    disconnected session. By default, SSL isn't used.

    WS-Management encrypts all PowerShell content transmitted over the network. **UseSSL** is an
    additional protection that sends the data across an HTTPS connection instead of an HTTP connection.

    If you use this parameter and SSL isn't available on the port that's used for the command, the
    command fails.

uid: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core.Receive-PSSession
name: Receive-PSSession
description: |-
  The `Receive-PSSession` cmdlet gets the results of commands running in PowerShell sessions
  (**PSSession**) that were disconnected. If the session is currently connected, `Receive-PSSession`
  gets the results of commands that were running when the session was disconnected. If the session is
  still disconnected, `Receive-PSSession` connects to the session, resumes any commands that were
  suspended, and gets the results of commands running in the session.

  This cmdlet was introduced in PowerShell 3.0.

  You can use a `Receive-PSSession` in addition to or instead of a `Connect-PSSession` command.
  `Receive-PSSession` can connect to any disconnected or reconnected session that was started in other
  sessions or on other computers.

  `Receive-PSSession` works on **PSSessions** that were disconnected intentionally using the
  `Disconnect-PSSession` cmdlet or the `Invoke-Command` **InDisconnectedSession** parameter. Or
  disconnected unintentionally by a network interruption.

  If you use the `Receive-PSSession` cmdlet to connect to a session in which no commands are running
  or suspended, `Receive-PSSession` connects to the session, but returns no output or errors.

  For more information about the Disconnected Sessions feature, see
  [about_Remote_Disconnected_Sessions](./About/about_Remote_Disconnected_Sessions.md).

  Some examples use splatting to reduce the line length and improve readability. For more information,
