  code: |-
    $job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-Process}
    Receive-Job -Job $job
  description: |-
    These commands use the **Job** parameter of `Receive-Job` to get the results of a particular job.

    The first command starts a job with `Start-Job` and stores the job object in the `$job` variable.

    The second command uses the `Receive-Job` cmdlet to get the results of the job.
    It uses the **Job** parameter to specify the job.

    This example stores a job in the `$job` variable, and pipes the job to the `Receive-Job` cmdlet. The
    `-Keep` parameter is also used to allow all aggregated stream data to be retrieved again
    after first view.

  summary: |+
    When you use the **AsJob** parameter of `Invoke-Command` to start a job, the job object is created
    on the local computer, even though the job runs on the remote computers.
    As a result, you use local commands to manage the job.

    Also, when you use **AsJob**, PowerShell returns one job object that contains a child job for each
    job
    that was started. In this case, the job object contains three child jobs, one for each job on each
    remote computer.

    This example shows how to get the results of background jobs run on three remote computers.
    Unlike the previous example, using `Invoke-Command` to run the `Start-Job` command actually
    started three independent jobs on each of the three computers. As a result, the command returned
    three job objects representing three jobs run locally on three different computers.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In the last command, because `$j` is a local variable, the script block uses the **Using** scope

    The `-Keep` parameter preserves the state of the aggregated streams of a job so that it
    can be viewed again. Without this parameter all aggregated stream data is erased when the job
    is received. For more information, see [about_Job_Details](About/about_Job_Details.md#child-jobs)

    > [!NOTE]
    > The aggregated streams include the streams of all child jobs. You can still reach the individual

parameters:

  name: AutoRemoveJob
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet deletes the job after it returns the job results.
    If the job has more results, the job is still deleted, but `Receive-Job` displays a message.

    This parameter works only on custom job types.
    It is designed for instances of job types that save the job or the type outside of the session, such
    as instances of scheduled jobs.

    This parameter cannot be used without the **Wait** parameter.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies an array of names of computers.

    This parameter selects from among the job results that are stored on the local computer.
    It does not get data for jobs run on remote computers.
    To get job results that are stored on remote computers, use the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet to run a
    `Receive-Job` command remotely.

  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet continues waiting if jobs are in the **Suspended** or **Disconnected**
    state. By default, the **Wait** parameter of `Receive-Job` returns, or terminates the wait, when
    jobs are in one of the following states:

    - Completed
    - Failed
    - Stopped
    - Suspended
    - Disconnected.

    The **Force** parameter is valid only when the **Wait** parameter is also used in the command.

  description: |+
    Specifies an array of IDs.
    This cmdlet gets the results of jobs with the specified IDs.

    The ID is an integer that uniquely identifies the job in the current session.
    It is easier to remember and type than the instance ID, but it is unique only in the current
    session. You can type one or more IDs separated by commas.
    To find the ID of a job, use `Get-Job`.

    Specifies an array of instance IDs.
    This cmdlet gets the results of jobs with the specified instance IDs.

    An instance ID is a GUID that uniquely identifies the job on the computer.
    To find the instance ID of a job, use the `Get-Job` cmdlet.

    Closing the session, or removing the job with the `Remove-Job` cmdlet also deletes aggregated
    stream data.

  description: |+
    Specifies an array of sessions.
    This cmdlet gets the results of jobs that were run in the specified PowerShell session
    (**PSSession**).
    Enter a variable that contains the **PSSession** or a command that gets the **PSSession**, such as a
    `Get-PSSession` command.

- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Wait
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet suppresses the command prompt until all job results are received.
    By default, `Receive-Job` immediately returns the available results.

    By default, the **Wait** parameter waits until the job is in one of the following states:

    - Completed
    - Failed
    - Stopped
    - Suspended
    - Disconnected.

    To direct the **Wait** parameter to continue waiting if the job state is Suspended or Disconnected,
    use the **Force** parameter together with the **Wait** parameter.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

    This parameter is valid only when the **Wait** parameter is used in the command and the **Keep**
    parameter is omitted.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

name: Receive-Job
description: |-
  The `Receive-Job` cmdlet gets the results of PowerShell background jobs, such as those started by
  using the `Start-Job` cmdlet or the **AsJob** parameter of any cmdlet.
  You can get the results of all jobs or identify jobs by their name, ID, instance ID, computer name,
  location, or session, or by submitting a job object.

  When you start a PowerShell background job, the job starts, but the results do not appear
  immediately. Instead, the command returns an object that represents the background job.
  The job object contains useful information about the job, but it does not contain the results.
  This method lets you continue to work in the session while the job runs.
  For more information about background jobs in PowerShell, see [about_Jobs](./About/about_Jobs.md).

  The `Receive-Job` cmdlet gets the results that have been generated by the time that the
  `Receive-Job` command is submitted.
  If the results are not yet complete, you can run additional `Receive-Job` commands to get the
  remaining results.

  By default, job results are deleted from the system when you receive them, but you can use the
  **Keep** parameter to save the results so that you can receive them again.
  To delete the job results, run the `Receive-Job` command again without the **Keep** parameter, close
  the session, or use the `Remove-Job` cmdlet to delete the job from the session.

  Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, `Receive-Job` also gets the results of custom job types, such as
  workflow jobs and instances of scheduled jobs.
  To enable `Receive-Job` to get the results a custom job type, import the module that supports the
  custom job type into the session before it runs a `Receive-Job` command, either by using the
  `Import-Module` cmdlet or by using or getting a cmdlet in the module.
  For information about a particular custom job type, see the documentation of the custom job type
  feature.
