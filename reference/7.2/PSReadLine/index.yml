  The PSReadLine module contains cmdlets that let you customize the command-line editing environment
  in PowerShell.

  There have been many updates to PSReadLine since the version that ships in
  Windows PowerShell 5.1.

  - PowerShell 7.3.0 ships with PSReadLine 2.2.6
  - PowerShell 7.2.5 ships with PSReadLine 2.1.0
  - PowerShell 7.0.11 ships with PSReadLine 2.0.4
  - PowerShell 5.1 ships with PSReadLine 2.0.0

  These articles document version 2.1.0 of PSReadLine.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Beginning with PowerShell 7.0, PowerShell skips auto-loading PSReadLine on
  > Windows if a screen reader program is detected. Currently, PSReadLine doesn't
  > work well with the screen readers. The default rendering and formatting of
  > PowerShell 7.0 on Windows works properly. You can manually load the module if
  > necessary.
