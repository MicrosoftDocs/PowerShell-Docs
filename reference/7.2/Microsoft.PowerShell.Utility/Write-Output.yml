- title: 'Example 1: Get objects and write them to the console'
  code: |-
    $P = Get-Process
    Write-Output $P
  description: |-
    The first command gets processes running on the computer and stores them in the `$P` variable.

    The second and third commands display the process objects in `$P` on the console.

- title: 'Example 2: Pass output to another cmdlet'
  code: |-
    Write-Output "test output" | Get-Member
  description: |-
    This command pipes the "test output" string to the `Get-Member` cmdlet, which displays the members
    of the **System.String** class, demonstrating that the string was passed along the pipeline.

- title: 'Example 3: Suppress enumeration in output'
  code: |-
    Write-Output 1,2,3 | Measure-Object

    Count    : 3
    ...

    Write-Output 1,2,3 -NoEnumerate | Measure-Object

    Count    : 1
    ...
  description: |-
    This command adds the **NoEnumerate** parameter to treat a collection or array as a single object
    through the pipeline.

    Specifies the objects to send down the pipeline. Enter a variable that contains the objects, or type
    a command or expression that gets the objects.

  name: NoEnumerate
  description: |+
    By default, the `Write-Output` cmdlet always enumerates its output. The **NoEnumerate** parameter
    suppresses the default behavior, and prevents `Write-Output` from enumerating output. The
    **NoEnumerate** parameter has no effect if the command is wrapped in parentheses, because the
    parentheses force enumeration. For example, `(Write-Output 1,2,3)` still enumerates the array.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This switch only works correctly with PowerShell Core 6.2 and newer. On older versions of
    > PowerShell Core, the collection is still enumerated even with use of this switch.

description: |-
  The `Write-Output` cmdlet sends the specified object down the pipeline to the next command.
  If the command is the last command in the pipeline, the object is displayed in the console.

  `Write-Output` sends objects down the primary pipeline, also known as the "output stream" or the
  "success pipeline." To send error objects down the error pipeline, use Write-Error.

  This cmdlet is typically used in scripts to display strings and other objects on the console. One of
  the built-in aliases for `Write-Output` is `echo` and similar to other shells that use `echo`, the
  default behavior is to display the output at the end of a pipeline. In PowerShell, it is generally
  not necessary to use the cmdlet in instances where the output is displayed by default. For example,
  `Get-Process | Write-Output` is equivalent to `Get-Process`. Or, `echo "Home directory: $HOME"` can
  be written, `"Home directory: $HOME"`.

  By default, `Write-Output` enumerates through collections provided to the cmdlet. However,
  `Write-Output` can also be used to pass collections down the pipeline as a single object with the
  **NoEnumerate** parameter.
