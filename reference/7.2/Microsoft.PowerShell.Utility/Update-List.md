# Update-List

## SYNOPSIS
Adds items to and removes items from a property value that contains a collection of objects.

## SYNTAX

### AddRemoveSet (Default)

```
Update-List [-Add <Object[]>] [-Remove <Object[]>] [-InputObject <PSObject>] [[-Property] <String>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

### ReplaceSet

```
Update-List -Replace <Object[]> [-InputObject <PSObject>] [[-Property] <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Update-List` cmdlet adds, removes, or replaces items in a property value of an object and
returns the updated object. This cmdlet is designed for properties that contain collections of
objects.

The **Add** and **Remove** parameters add individual items to and remove them from the collection.
The **Replace** parameter replaces the entire collection.

If you do not specify a property in the command, `Update-List` returns an object that describes the
update instead of updating the object. You can submit the update object to cmdlets that change
objects, such as `Set` cmdlets.

This cmdlet works only when the property that is being updated supports the **IList** interface that
`Update-List` uses. Also, any `Set` cmdlets that accept an update must support the **IList**
interface.

The core cmdlets that are installed with PowerShell do not support this interface. To
determine whether a cmdlet supports `Update-List`, see the cmdlet Help topic.

This cmdlet was reintroduced in PowerShell 7.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Add items to a property value

In this example we create a class that represents a deck of cards where the cards are stored as a
**List** collection object. The **NewDeck()** method uses `Update-List`to add a complete deck of
card values to the **cards** collection.

```powershell
class Cards {

    [System.Collections.Generic.List[string]]$cards
    [string]$name

    Cards([string]$_name) {
        $this.name = $_name
        $this.cards = [System.Collections.Generic.List[string]]::new()
    }

    NewDeck() {
        $_suits = "`u{2663}","`u{2666}","`u{2665}","`u{2660}"
        $_values = 'A',2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,'J','Q','K'
        $_deck = foreach ($s in $_suits){ foreach ($v in $_values){ "$v$s"} }
        $this | Update-List -Property cards -Add $_deck | Out-Null
    }

    Show() {
        Write-Host
        Write-Host $this.name ": " $this.cards[0..12]
        if ($this.cards.count -gt 13) {
            Write-Host (' ' * ($this.name.length+3)) $this.cards[13..25]
        }
        if ($this.cards.count -gt 26) {
            Write-Host (' ' * ($this.name.length+3)) $this.cards[26..38]
        }
        if ($this.cards.count -gt 39) {
            Write-Host (' ' * ($this.name.length+3)) $this.cards[39..51]
        }
    }

    Shuffle() { $this.cards = Get-Random -InputObject $this.cards -Count 52 }

    Sort() { $this.cards.Sort() }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `Update-List` cmdlet outputs the updated object to the pipeline. We pipe the output to
> `Out-Null` to suppress the unwanted display.

### Example 2: Add and remove items of a collection property

Continuing with the code in Example 1, we will create instances of the **Cards** class to represent
a deck of cards and the cards held by two players. We use the `Update-List` cmdlet to add cards to
the players' hands and to remove cards from the deck.

```powershell
$player1 = [Cards]::new('Player 1')
$player2 = [Cards]::new('Player 2')

$deck = [Cards]::new('Deck')
$deck.NewDeck()
$deck.Shuffle()
$deck.Show()

# Deal two hands
$player1 | Update-List -Property cards -Add $deck.cards[0,2,4,6,8] | Out-Null
$player2 | Update-List -Property cards -Add $deck.cards[1,3,5,7,9] | Out-Null
$deck | Update-List -Property cards -Remove $player1.cards | Out-Null
$deck | Update-List -Property cards -Remove $player2.cards | Out-Null

$player1.Show()
$player2.Show()
$deck.Show()
```

```Output
Deck :  4♦ 7♥ J♦ 5♣ A♣ 8♦ J♣ Q♥ 6♦ 3♦ 9♦ 6♣ 2♣
        K♥ 4♠ 10♥ 8♠ 10♦ 9♠ 6♠ K♦ 7♣ 3♣ Q♣ A♥ Q♠
        3♥ 5♥ 2♦ 5♠ J♥ J♠ 10♣ 4♥ Q♦ 10♠ 4♣ 2♠ 2♥
        6♥ 7♦ A♠ 5♦ 8♣ 9♥ K♠ 7♠ 3♠ 9♣ A♦ K♣ 8♥

Player 1 :  4♦ J♦ A♣ J♣ 6♦

Player 2 :  7♥ 5♣ 8♦ Q♥ 3♦

Deck :  9♦ 6♣ 2♣ K♥ 4♠ 10♥ 8♠ 10♦ 9♠ 6♠ K♦ 7♣ 3♣
        Q♣ A♥ Q♠ 3♥ 5♥ 2♦ 5♠ J♥ J♠ 10♣ 4♥ Q♦ 10♠
        4♣ 2♠ 2♥ 6♥ 7♦ A♠ 5♦ 8♣ 9♥ K♠ 7♠ 3♠ 9♣
        A♦ K♣ 8♥
```

The output shows the state of the deck before the cards were dealt to the players. You can see that
each player received five cards from the deck. The final output shows the state of the deck after
dealing the cards to the players. `Update-List` was used to select the cards from the deck and add
them to the players' collection. Then the players' cards were removed from the deck using
`Update-List`.

### Example 3: Add and remove items in a single command

`Update-List` allows you to use the **Add** and **Remove** parameters in a single command. In this
example, Player 1 wants to discard the `4♦` and `6♦` and get two new cards.

```powershell
# Player 1 wants two new cards - remove 2 cards & add 2 cards
$player1 | Update-List -Property cards -Remove $player1.cards[0,4] -Add $deck.cards[0..1] | Out-Null
$player1.Show()

# remove dealt cards from deck
$deck | Update-List -Property cards -Remove $deck.cards[0..1] | Out-Null
$deck.Show()
```

```Output
Player 1 :  J♦ A♣ J♣ 9♦ 6♣

Deck :  2♣ K♥ 4♠ 10♥ 8♠ 10♦ 9♠ 6♠ K♦ 7♣ 3♣ Q♣ A♥
        Q♠ 3♥ 5♥ 2♦ 5♠ J♥ J♠ 10♣ 4♥ Q♦ 10♠ 4♣ 2♠
        2♥ 6♥ 7♦ A♠ 5♦ 8♣ 9♥ K♠ 7♠ 3♠ 9♣ A♦ K♣
        8♥
```
