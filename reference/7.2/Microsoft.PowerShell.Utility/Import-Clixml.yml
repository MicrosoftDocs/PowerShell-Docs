### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Imports a CLIXML file and creates corresponding objects in PowerShell.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
notes: |-
  When specifying multiple values for a parameter, use commas to separate the values. For example,
  `<parameter-name> <value1>, <value2>`.
inputs:
- name: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    You can pipeline a string that contains a path to `Import-Clixml`.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="PSObject" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    `Import-Clixml` returns objects that were deserialized from the stored XML files.

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Import a serialized file and recreate an object'
  code: |-
    Get-Process | Export-Clixml -Path .\pi.xml
    $Processes = Import-Clixml -Path .\pi.xml
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example uses the `Export-Clixml` cmdlet to save a serialized copy of the process information
    returned by `Get-Process`. `Import-Clixml` retrieves the serialized file's contents and recreates an
    object that is stored in the `$Processes` variable.

- title: 'Example 2: Import a secure credential object'
  code: |-
    $Credxmlpath = Join-Path (Split-Path $Profile) TestScript.ps1.credential
    $Credential | Export-Clixml $Credxmlpath
    $Credxmlpath = Join-Path (Split-Path $Profile) TestScript.ps1.credential
    $Credential = Import-Clixml $Credxmlpath
  description: |-
    The `Export-Clixml` cmdlet encrypts credential objects by using the Windows [Data Protection API](/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh464970(v=win.10)).
    The encryption ensures that only your user account can decrypt the contents of the credential
    object. The exported `CLIXML` file can't be used on a different computer or by a different user.

    In the example, the file in which the credential is stored is represented by
    `TestScript.ps1.credential`. Replace **TestScript** with the name of the script with which you're
    loading the credential.

    You send the credential object down the pipeline to `Export-Clixml`, and save it to the path,
    `$Credxmlpath`, that you specified in the first command.

    To import the credential automatically into your script, run the final two commands. Run
    `Import-Clixml` to import the secured credential object into your script. This import eliminates the
    risk of exposing plain-text passwords in your script.
  summary: |+
    In this example, given a credential that you've stored in the `$Credential` variable by running the
    `Get-Credential` cmdlet, you can run the `Export-Clixml` cmdlet to save the credential to disk.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > `Export-Clixml` only exports encrypted credentials on Windows. On non-Windows operating systems
    > such as macOS and Linux, credentials are exported in plain text.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.UInt64" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: First
  description: |+
    Gets only the specified number of objects. Enter the number of objects to get.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: IncludeTotalCount
  description: |+
    Reports the total number of objects in the data set followed by the selected objects. If the cmdlet
    can't determine the total count, it displays **Unknown total count**. The integer has an
    **Accuracy** property that indicates the reliability of the total count value. The value of
    **Accuracy** ranges from `0.0` to `1.0` where `0.0` means that the cmdlet couldn't count the
    objects, `1.0` means that the count is exact, and a value between `0.0` and `1.0` indicates an
    increasingly reliable estimate.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: LiteralPath
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the path to the XML files. Unlike **Path**, the value of the **LiteralPath** parameter is
    used exactly as it's typed. No characters are interpreted as wildcards. If the path includes escape
    characters, enclose it in single quotation marks. Single quotation marks tell PowerShell not to
    interpret any characters as escape sequences.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: PSPath, LP
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Path
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the path to the XML files.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.UInt64" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Skip
  description: |+
    Ignores the specified number of objects and then gets the remaining objects. Enter the number of
    objects to skip.

description: |-
  The `Import-Clixml` cmdlet imports a Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) XML file with data that
  represents Microsoft .NET Framework objects and creates the PowerShell objects. For more information
  about CLI, see [Language independence](/dotnet/standard/language-independence).

  A valuable use of `Import-Clixml` on Windows computers is to import credentials and secure strings
  that were exported as secure XML using `Export-Clixml`. For an example, see Example 2.

  `Import-Clixml` uses the byte-order-mark (BOM) to detect the encoding format of the file. If the
  file has no BOM, it assumes the encoding is UTF8.
