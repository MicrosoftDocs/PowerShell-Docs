## DESCRIPTION

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet gets events from event logs, including classic logs, such as the
**System** and **Application** logs. The cmdlet gets data from event logs that are generated by the
Windows Event Log technology introduced in Windows Vista. And, events in log files generated by
**Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)**. By default, `Get-WinEvent` returns event information in the
order of newest to oldest.

`Get-WinEvent` lists event logs and event log providers. To interrupt the command, press
<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>. You can get events from selected logs or from logs generated by
selected event providers. And, you can combine events from multiple sources in a single command.
`Get-WinEvent` allows you to filter events using XPath queries, structured XML queries, and hash
table queries.

If you're not running PowerShell as an Administrator, you might see error messages that you cannot
retrieve information about a log.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get all the logs from a local computer

This command gets all the event logs on the local computer. Logs are listed in the order that
`Get-WinEvent` gets them. Classic logs are retrieved first, followed by the new Windows Event logs.
It's possible for a log's **RecordCount** to be null, which is blank, or zero.

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -ListLog *
```

```Output
LogMode   MaximumSizeInBytes RecordCount LogName
-------   ------------------ ----------- -------
Circular            15532032       14500 Application
Circular             1052672         117 Azure Information Protection
Circular             1052672        3015 CxAudioSvcLog
Circular            20971520             ForwardedEvents
Circular            20971520           0 HardwareEvents
```

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet gets log information from the computer. The **ListLog** parameter uses the
asterisk (`*`) wildcard to display information about each log.

### Example 2: Get the classic Setup log

This command gets an **EventLogConfiguration** object that represents the classic **Setup** log. The
object includes information about the log, such as file size, provider, file path, and whether the
log is enabled.

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -ListLog Setup | Format-List -Property *
```

```Output
FileSize                       : 69632
IsLogFull                      : False

MaximumSizeInBytes             : 1052672
LogMode                        : Circular
OwningProviderName             : Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog
ProviderNames                  : {Microsoft-Windows-WUSA, Microsoft-Windows-ActionQueue...
ProviderLevel                  :
ProviderKeywords               :
ProviderBufferSize             : 64
ProviderMinimumNumberOfBuffers : 0
ProviderMaximumNumberOfBuffers : 64
ProviderLatency                : 1000
ProviderControlGuid            :
```

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet uses the **ListLog** parameter to specify the **Setup** log. The object is
sent down the pipeline to the `Format-List` cmdlet. `Format-List` uses the **Property** parameter
with the asterisk (`*`) wildcard to display each property.

### Example 3: Get event logs from a server

This command only gets event logs on the local computer that contain events. It's possible for a
log's **RecordCount** to be null or zero. The example uses the `$_` variable. For more information,
see [about_Automatic_Variables](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/about/about_automatic_variables.md).

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -ListLog * -ComputerName localhost | Where-Object { $_.RecordCount }
```

```Output
LogMode   MaximumSizeInBytes RecordCount LogName
-------   ------------------ ----------- -------
Circular            15532032       14546 Application
Circular             1052672         117 Azure Information Protection
Circular             1052672        2990 CxAudioSvcLog
Circular             1052672           9 MSFTVPN Setup
Circular             1052672         282 OAlerts
```

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet gets log information from the computer. The **ListLog** parameter uses the
asterisk (`*`) wildcard to display information about each log. The **ComputerName** parameter
specifies to get the logs from the local computer, **localhost**. The objects are sent down the
pipeline to the `Where-Object` cmdlet. `Where-Object` uses `$_.RecordCount` to return only logs that
contain data. `$_` is a variable that represents the current object in the pipeline. **RecordCount**
is a property of the object with a non-null value.

### Example 4: Get event logs from multiple servers

This example gets objects that represent the **Application** event logs on three computers:
Server01, Server02, and Server03. The **ForEach** keyword is used because the **ComputerName**
parameter accepts only one value. For more information, see [about_Foreach](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/about/about_Foreach.md).

```powershell
$S = 'Server01', 'Server02', 'Server03'
ForEach ($Server in $S) {
  Get-WinEvent -ListLog Application -ComputerName $Server |
    Select-Object LogMode, MaximumSizeInBytes, RecordCount, LogName,
      @{name='ComputerName'; expression={$Server}} |
    Format-Table -AutoSize
}
```

```Output
 LogMode MaximumSizeInBytes RecordCount LogName     ComputerName
 ------- ------------------ ----------- -------     ------------
Circular           15532032       14577 Application Server01
Circular           15532032        9689 Application Server02
Circular           15532032        5309 Application Server03
```

The variable `$S` stores the names three servers: **Server01**, **Server02**, and **Server03**. The
**ForEach** statement uses a loop to process each server, `($Server in $S)`. The script block in the
curly braces (`{ }`) runs the `Get-WinEvent` command. The **ListLog** parameter specifies the
**Application** log. The **ComputerName** parameter uses the variable `$Server` to get log
information from each server.

The objects are sent down the pipeline to the `Select-Object` cmdlet. `Select-Object` gets the
properties **LogMode**, **MaximumSizeInBytes**, **RecordCount**, **LogName**, and uses a calculated
expression to display the **ComputerName** using the `$Server` variable. The objects are sent down
the pipeline to the `Format-Table` cmdlet to display the output in the PowerShell console. The
**AutoSize** parameter formats the output to fit the screen.

### Example 5: Get event log providers and log names

This command gets the event log providers and the logs to which they write.

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -ListProvider *
```

```Output
Name     : .NET Runtime
LogLinks : {Application}
Opcodes  : {}
Tasks    : {}

Name     : .NET Runtime Optimization Service
LogLinks : {Application}
Opcodes  : {}
Tasks    : {}
```

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet gets log information from the computer. The **ListProvider** parameter
uses the asterisk (`*`) wildcard to display information about each provider. In the output, the
**Name** is the provider and **LogLinks** is the log that the provider writes to.

### Example 6: Get all event log providers that write to a specific log

This command gets all of the providers that write to the **Application** log.

```powershell
(Get-WinEvent -ListLog Application).ProviderNames
```

```Output
.NET Runtime
.NET Runtime Optimization Service
Application
Application Error
Application Hang
Application Management
```

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet gets log information from the computer. The **ListLog** parameter uses
**Application** to get objects for that log. **ProviderNames** is a property of the object and
displays the providers that write to the **Application** log.

### Example 7: Get event log provider names that contain a specific string

This command gets the event log providers with names that include a specific string in the
provider's name.

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -ListProvider *Policy*
```

```Output
Name     : Group Policy Applications
LogLinks : {Application}
Opcodes  : {}
Tasks    : {}

Name     : Group Policy Client
LogLinks : {Application}
Opcodes  : {}
Tasks    : {}

Name     : Group Policy Data Sources
LogLinks : {Application}
Opcodes  : {}
Tasks    : {}
```

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet gets log information from the computer. The **ListProvider** parameter
uses the asterisk (`*`) wildcard to find **Policy** anywhere within the provider's name.

### Example 8: Get Event Ids that the event provider generates

This command lists the Event Ids that the **Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy** event provider generates
along with the event description.

```powershell
(Get-WinEvent -ListProvider Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy).Events | Format-Table Id, Description
```

```Output
  Id  Description
  --  -----------
1500  The Group Policy settings for the computer were processed successfully...
1501  The Group Policy settings for the user were processed successfully...
4115  Group Policy Service started.
4116  Started the Group Policy service initialization phase.
4117  Group Policy Session started.
```

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet gets log information from the computer. The **ListProvider** parameter
specifies the provider, **Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy**. The expression is wrapped in parentheses
and uses the **Events** property to get objects. The objects are sent down the pipeline to the
`Format-Table` cmdlet. `Format-Table` displays the **Id** and **Description** of the event objects.

### Example 9: Get log information from event object properties

This example shows how to get information about a log's contents using event object properties.
Event objects are stored in a variable and then grouped and counted by **Event Id** and **Level**.

```powershell
$Event = Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Windows PowerShell'
$Event.Count
$Event | Group-Object -Property Id -NoElement | Sort-Object -Property Count -Descending
$Event | Group-Object -Property LevelDisplayName -NoElement
```

```Output
195

Count  Name
-----  ----
  147  600
   22  400
   21  601
    3  403
    2  103

Count  Name
-----  ----
    2  Warning
  193  Information
```

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet uses the **LogName** parameter to specify the **Windows PowerShell** event
log. The event objects are stored in the `$Event` variable. The **Count** property of `$Event`shows
the total number of logged events.

The `$Event` variable is sent down the pipeline to the `Group-Object` cmdlet. `Group-Object` uses
the **Property** parameter to specify the **Id** property and counts the objects by the event Id
value. The **NoElement** parameter removes other properties from the objects output. The grouped
objects are sent down the pipeline to the `Sort-Object` cmdlet. `Sort-Object` uses the **Property**
parameter to sort the objects by **Count**. The **Descending** parameter displays the output by
count, from highest to lowest. In the output, the **Count** column contains the total number of each
event. The **Name** column contains the grouped event Id numbers.

The `$Event` variable is sent down the pipeline to the `Group-Object` cmdlet. `Group-Object` uses
the **Property** parameter to specify the **LevelDisplayName** property and counts the objects by
**LevelDisplayName**. The objects are grouped by the levels such as **Warning** and **Information**.
The **NoElement** parameter removes other properties from the output. In the output, the **Count**
column contains the total number of each event. The **Name** column contains the grouped
**LevelDisplayName**.

### Example 10: Get error events that have a specified string in their name

This example uses a comma-separated string of log names. The output is grouped by the level such as
error or warning and the log name.

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -LogName *PowerShell*, Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-WHEA* |
  Group-Object -Property LevelDisplayName, LogName -NoElement |
    Format-Table -AutoSize
```

```Output
Count  Name
-----  ----
    1  Error, PowerShellCore/Operational
   26  Information, Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-WHEA/Operational
  488  Information, Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational
   77  Information, PowerShellCore/Operational
 9835  Information, Windows PowerShell
   19  Verbose, PowerShellCore/Operational
  444  Warning, Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational
  512  Warning, PowerShellCore/Operational
```

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet gets log information from the computer. The **LogName** parameter uses a
comma-separated string with the asterisk (`*`) wildcard to specify the log names. The objects are
sent down the pipeline to the `Group-Object` cmdlet. `Group-Object` uses the **Property** parameter
to group the objects by **LevelDisplayName** and **LogName**. The **NoElement** parameter removes
other properties from the output. The grouped objects are sent down the pipeline to the
`Format-Table` cmdlet. `Format-Table` uses the **AutoSize** parameter to format the columns. The
**Count** column contains the total number of each event. The **Name** column contains the grouped
**LevelDisplayName** and **LogName**.

### Example 11: Get events from an archived event log

`Get-WinEvent` can get event information from saved log files. This sample uses an archived
PowerShell log that is stored on the local computer.

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -Path 'C:\Test\Windows PowerShell.evtx'
```

```Output
   ProviderName: PowerShell

TimeCreated              Id LevelDisplayName  Message
-----------              -- ----------------  -------
3/15/2019 13:54:13      403 Information       Engine state is changed from Available to Stopped...
3/15/2019 13:54:13      400 Information       Engine state is changed from None to Available...
3/15/2019 13:54:13      600 Information       Provider "Variable" is Started...
3/15/2019 13:54:13      600 Information       Provider "Function" is Started...
3/15/2019 13:54:13      600 Information       Provider "FileSystem" is Started...
```

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet gets log information from the computer. The **Path** parameter specifies
the directory and file name.

### Example 12: Get a specific number of events from an archived event log

These commands get a specific number of events from an archived event log. `Get-WinEvent` has
parameters that can get a maximum number of events or the oldest events. This sample uses an
archived PowerShell log that is stored in **C:\Test\PowerShellCore Operational.evtx**.

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -Path 'C:\Test\PowerShellCore Operational.evtx' -MaxEvents 100
```

```Output
   ProviderName: PowerShellCore

TimeCreated                 Id   LevelDisplayName  Message
-----------                 --   ----------------  -------
3/15/2019 09:54:54        4104   Warning           Creating Scriptblock text (1 of 1):...

3/7/2019 10:53:22         8195   Verbose           Opening RunspacePool
```

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet gets log information from the computer. The **Path** parameter specifies
the directory and filename. The **MaxEvents** parameter specifies that 100 records are displayed,
from newest to oldest.

### Example 13: Event Tracing for Windows

Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) writes events to the log as events occur. The events are stored in
the order of oldest to newest. An archived ETW file is saved as an `.etl` such as **TraceLog.etl**.
The events are listed in the order in which they are written to the log, so the *Oldest* parameter
is required.

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -Path 'C:\Tracing\TraceLog.etl' -Oldest |
  Sort-Object -Property TimeCreated -Descending |
    Select-Object -First 100
```

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet gets log information from the archived file. The **Path** parameter
specifies the directory and file name. The **Oldest** parameter is used to output events in the
order they are written, oldest to newest. The objects are sent down the pipeline to the
`Sort-Object` cmdlet `Sort-Object` sorts the objects in descending order by the value of the
**TimeCreated** property. The objects are sent down the pipeline to the `Select-Object` cmdlet that
displays the 100 newest events.

### Example 14: Get events from an event trace log

This example shows how to get the events from an event trace log file (`.etl`) and an archived
Windows PowerShell log file (`.evtx`). You can combine multiple file types in a single command.
Because the files contain the same type of **.NET Framework** object, **EventLogRecord**, you can
filter them with the same properties. The command requires the **Oldest** parameter because it is
reading from an `.etl` file, but the **Oldest** parameter applies to each file.

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -Path 'C:\Tracing\TraceLog.etl', 'C:\Test\Windows PowerShell.evtx' -Oldest |
  Where-Object { $_.Id -eq '403' }
```

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet gets log information from the archived files. The **Path** parameter uses
a comma-separated list to specify each files directory and file name. The **Oldest** parameter is
used to output events in the order they are written, oldest to newest. The objects are sent down the
pipeline to the `Where-Object` cmdlet. `Where-Object` uses a script block to find events with and
**Id** of **403**. The `$_` variable represents the current object in the pipeline and **Id** is the
Event Id property.

### Example 15: Filter event log results

This example shows a variety of methods to filter and select events from an event log. All of these
commands get events that occurred in the last 24-hours from the **Windows PowerShell** event log.
The filter methods are more efficient than using the `Where-Object` cmdlet. Filters are applied as
the objects are retrieved. `Where-Object` retrieves all of the objects, then applies filters to all
of the objects.

```powershell
# Using the Where-Object cmdlet:
$Yesterday = (Get-Date) - (New-TimeSpan -Day 1)
Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Windows PowerShell' | Where-Object { $_.TimeCreated -ge $Yesterday }

# Using the FilterHashtable parameter:
$Yesterday = (Get-Date) - (New-TimeSpan -Day 1)
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{ LogName='Windows PowerShell'; Level=3; StartTime=$Yesterday }

# Using the FilterXML parameter:
$xmlQuery = @'
<QueryList>
  <Query Id="0" Path="Windows PowerShell">
    <Select Path="System">*[System[(Level=3) and
        TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) &lt;= 86400000]]]</Select>
  </Query>
</QueryList>
'@
Get-WinEvent -FilterXML $xmlQuery

# Using the FilterXPath parameter:
$XPath = '*[System[Level=3 and TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) &lt;= 86400000]]]'
Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Windows PowerShell' -FilterXPath $XPath
```

### Example 16: Use FilterHashtable to get events from the Application log

This example uses the **FilterHashtable** parameter to get events from the **Application** log. The
hash table uses **key/value** pairs. For more information about the **FilterHashtable** parameter,
see [Creating Get-WinEvent queries with FilterHashtable](/powershell/scripting/samples/Creating-Get-WinEvent-queries-with-FilterHashtable).
For more information about hash tables, see [about_Hash_Tables](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/about/about_hash_tables.md).

```powershell
$Date = (Get-Date).AddDays(-2)
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{ LogName='Application'; StartTime=$Date; Id='1003' }
```

The `Get-Date` cmdlet uses the **AddDays** method to get a date that is two days before the current
date. The date object is stored in the `$Date` variable.

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet gets log information. The **FilterHashtable** parameter is used to filter
the output. The **LogName** key specifies the value as the **Application** log. The **StartTime**
key uses the value stored in the `$Date` variable. The **Id** key uses an Event Id value, **1003**.

### Example 17: Use FilterHashtable to get application errors

This example uses the **FilterHashtable** parameter to find Internet Explorer application errors
that occurred within the last week.

```powershell
$StartTime = (Get-Date).AddDays(-7)
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{
  Logname='Application'
  ProviderName='Application Error'
  Data='iexplore.exe'
  StartTime=$StartTime
}
```

The `Get-Date` cmdlet uses the **AddDays** method to get a date that is seven days before the
current date. The date object is stored in the `$StartTime` variable.

The `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet gets log information. The **FilterHashtable** parameter is used to filter
the output. The **LogName** key specifies the value as the **Application** log. The **ProviderName**
key uses the value, **Application Error**, which is the event's **Source**. The **Data** key uses
the value **iexplore.exe** The **StartTime** key uses the value stored in `$StartTime` variable.

### Example 18: Use SuppressHashFilter to filter application errors

Like Example 16 above, this example uses the **FilterHashtable** parameter to get events from the
**Application** log. However, we add the **SuppressHashFilter** key to filter out **Information**
level events.

```powershell
$Date = (Get-Date).AddDays(-2)
$filter = @{
  LogName='Application'
  StartTime=$Date
  SuppressHashFilter=@{Level=4}
}
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable $filter
```

In this example, `Get-WinEvent` gets all events from the **Application** log for the last two days
except those that have a **Level** of 4 (Information).

## PARAMETERS

### -ComputerName

Specifies the name of the computer that this cmdlet gets events from the event logs. Type the
NetBIOS name, an IP address, or the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the computer. The default
value is the local computer, **localhost**. This parameter accepts only one computer name at a time.

To get event logs from remote computers, configure the firewall port for the event log service to
allow remote access.

This cmdlet does not rely on PowerShell remoting. You can use the **ComputerName** parameter even if
your computer is not configured to run remote commands.

```

### -FilterHashtable

Specifies a query in hash table format to select events from one or more event logs. The query
contains a hash table with one or more **key/value** pairs.

Hash table queries have the following rules:

- Keys and values are case-insensitive.
- Wildcard characters are valid only in the values associated with the **LogName** and
  **ProviderName** keys.
- Each key can be listed only once in each hash table.
- The **Path** value takes paths to `.etl`, `.evt`, and `.evtx` log files.
- The **LogName**, **Path**, and **ProviderName** keys can be used in the same query.
- The **UserID** key can take a valid security identifier (SID) or a domain account name that can be
  used to construct a valid **System.Security.Principal.NTAccount object**.
- The **Data** value takes event data in an unnamed field. For example, events in classic event
  logs.
- `<named-data>` key represents a named event data field.

When `Get-WinEvent` cannot interpret a **key/value** pair, it interprets the key as a case-sensitive
name for the event data in the event.

The valid `Get-WinEvent` **key/value** pairs are as follows:

- **LogName**=`<String[]>`
- **ProviderName**=`<String[]>`
- **Path**=`<String[]>`
- **Keywords**=`<Long[]>`
- **ID**=`<Int32[]>`
- **Level**=`<Int32[]>`
- **StartTime**=`<DateTime>`
- **EndTime**=`<DateTime>`
- **UserID**=`<SID>`
- **Data**=`<String[]>`
- `<named-data>`=`<String[]>`
- **SuppressHashFilter**=`<Hashtable>`

```yaml
Type: System.Collections.Hashtable[]
Parameter Sets: HashQuerySet
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -FilterXml

Specifies a structured XML query that this cmdlet selects events from one or more event logs.

To generate a valid XML query, use the **Create Custom View** and **Filter Current Log** features in
Windows Event Viewer. Use the items in the dialog box to create a query, and then click the XML tab
to view the query in XML format. You can copy the XML from the XML tab into the value of the
**FilterXml** parameter. For more information about the Event Viewer features, see Event Viewer
Help.

Use an XML query to create a complex query that contains several XPath statements. The XML format
also allows you to use a **Suppress XML** element that excludes events from the query. For more
information about the XML schema for event log queries, see [Query Schema](/windows/win32/wes/queryschema-schema)
and the XML Event Queries section of [Event Selection](/previous-versions/aa385231(v=vs.85)).

You may also create a **Suppress** element using the **FilterHashtable** parameter.

```yaml
Type: System.Xml.XmlDocument
Parameter Sets: XmlQuerySet
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -FilterXPath

Specifies an XPath query that this cmdlet select events from one or more logs.

For more information about the XPath language, see [XPath Reference](/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/ms256115(v=vs.100))
and the Selection Filters section of [Event Selection](/previous-versions/aa385231(v=vs.85)).

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: GetLogSet, GetProviderSet, FileSet
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force

Gets debug and analytic logs, in addition to other event logs. The **Force** parameter is required
to get a debug or analytic log when the value of the name parameter includes wildcard characters.

By default, the `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet excludes these logs unless you specify the full name of a
debug or analytic log.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: GetLogSet, ListLogSet, GetProviderSet, HashQuerySet
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ListLog

Specifies the event logs. Enter the event log names in a comma-separated list. Wildcards are
permitted. To get all the logs, use the asterisk (`*`) wildcard.

```yaml
Type: System.String[]
Parameter Sets: ListLogSet
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -ListProvider

Specifies the event log providers that this cmdlet gets. An event log provider is a program or
service that writes events to the event log.

Enter the provider names in a comma-separated list. Wildcards are permitted. To get the providers of
all the event logs on the computer, use the asterisk (`*`) wildcard.

```yaml
Type: System.String[]
Parameter Sets: ListProviderSet
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -LogName

Specifies the event logs that this cmdlet get events from. Enter the event log names in a
comma-separated list. Wildcards are permitted. You can also pipe log names to the `Get-WinEvent`
cmdlet.

> [!NOTE]
> PowerShell does not limit the amount of logs you can request. However, the `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet
> queries the Windows API which has a limit of 256. This can make it difficult to filter through all
> of your logs at one time. You can work around this by using a `foreach` loop to iterate through each
> log like this: `Get-WinEvent -ListLog * | ForEach-Object{ Get-WinEvent -LogName $_.Logname }`

```yaml
Type: System.String[]
Parameter Sets: GetLogSet
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -MaxEvents

Specifies the maximum number of events that are returned. Enter an integer such as 100. The default
is to return all the events in the logs or files.

```yaml
Type: System.Int64
Parameter Sets: GetLogSet, GetProviderSet, FileSet, HashQuerySet, XmlQuerySet
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Oldest

Indicate that this cmdlet gets the events in oldest-first order. By default, events are returned in
newest-first order.

This parameter is required to get events from `.etl` and `.evt` files and from debug and analytic
logs. In these files, events are recorded in oldest-first order, and the events can be returned only
in oldest-first order.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: GetLogSet, GetProviderSet, FileSet, HashQuerySet, XmlQuerySet
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Path

Specifies the path to the event log files that this cmdlet get events from. Enter the paths to the
log files in a comma-separated list, or use wildcard characters to create file path patterns.

`Get-WinEvent` supports files with the `.evt`, `.evtx`, and `.etl` file name extensions. You can
include events from different files and file types in the same command.

```yaml
Type: System.String[]
Parameter Sets: FileSet
Aliases: PSPath

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -ProviderName

Specifies, as a string array, the event log providers from which this cmdlet gets events. Enter the
provider names in a comma-separated list, or use wildcard characters to create provider name
patterns.

An event log provider is a program or service that writes events to the event log. It is not a
PowerShell provider.

```yaml
Type: System.String[]
Parameter Sets: GetProviderSet
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable,
-InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose,
-WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### System.String, System.Xml.XmlDocument, System.Collections.Hashtable

You can pipeline a **LogName** (string), a **FilterXML** query, or a **FilterHashtable** query to
`Get-WinEvent`.

## OUTPUTS

### System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.EventLogConfiguration, System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.EventLogRecord, System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.ProviderMetadata

With the **ListLog** parameter, `Get-WinEvent` returns
**System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.EventLogConfiguration** objects.

With the **ListProvider** parameter, `Get-WinEvent` returns
**System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.ProviderMetadata** objects.

With all other parameters, `Get-WinEvent` returns
**System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.EventLogRecord** objects.

## NOTES

`Get-WinEvent` is designed to replace the `Get-EventLog` cmdlet on computers running Windows Vista
and later versions of Windows. `Get-EventLog` gets events only in classic event logs. `Get-EventLog`
is retained for backward compatibility.

The `Get-WinEvent` and `Get-EventLog` cmdlets are not supported in Windows Pre-installation
Environment (Windows PE).
