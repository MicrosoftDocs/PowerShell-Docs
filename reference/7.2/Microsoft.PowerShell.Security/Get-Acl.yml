### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Gets the security descriptor for a resource, such as a file or registry key.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Security
notes: |-
  This cmdlet is only available on Windows platforms.

  By default, `Get-Acl` displays the PowerShell path to the resource (`<provider>::<resource-path>`),
  the owner of the resource, and "Access", a list (array) of the access control entries in the
  discretionary access control list (DACL) for the resource. The DACL list is controlled by the
  resource owner.

  When you format the result as a list, (`Get-Acl | Format-List`), in addition to the path, owner,
  and access list, PowerShell displays the following properties and property values:

  - **Group**: The security group of the owner.
  - **Audit**:  A list (array) of entries in the system access control list (SACL). The SACL
    specifies the types of access attempts for which Windows generates audit records.
  - **Sddl**: The security descriptor of the resource displayed in a single text string in Security
    Descriptor Definition Language format. PowerShell uses the **GetSddlForm** method of security
    descriptors to get this data.

  Because `Get-Acl` is supported by the file system and registry providers, you can use `Get-Acl` to
  view the ACL of file system objects, such as files and directories, and registry objects, such as
  registry keys and entries.
inputs:
- name: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    You can pipe a string that contains a path to `Get-Acl`.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="System.Security.AccessControl.FileSecurity, System.Security.AccessControl.DirectorySecurity, System.Security.AccessControl.RegistrySecurity" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    `Get-Acl` returns an object that represents the ACLs that it gets. The object type depends upon the
    ACL type.

examples:
- title: Example 1- Get an ACL for a folder
  code: |-
    Get-Acl C:\Windows
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example gets the security descriptor of the `C:\Windows` directory.

- title: Example 2 - Get an ACL for a folder using wildcards
  code: |-
    Get-Acl C:\Windows\s*.log | Format-List -Property PSPath, Sddl
  description: |-
    The command uses the `Get-Acl` cmdlet to get objects representing the security descriptors of each
    log file. It uses a pipeline operator (`|`) to send the results to the `Format-List` cmdlet. The
    command uses the **Property** parameter of `Format-List` to display only the **PsPath** and **SDDL**
    properties of each security descriptor object.

    Lists are often used in PowerShell, because long values appear truncated in tables.

    The **SDDL** values are valuable to system administrators, because they are simple text strings that
    contain all of the information in the security descriptor. As such, they are easy to pass and store,
    and they can be parsed when needed.
  summary: |+
    This example gets the PowerShell path and SDDL for all of the `.log` files in the `C:\Windows`
    directory whose names begin with `s`.

- title: Example 3 - Get count of Audit entries for an ACL
  code: |-
    Get-Acl C:\Windows\s*.log -Audit | ForEach-Object { $_.Audit.Count }
  description: |-
    It uses the **Audit** parameter to get the audit records from the SACL in the security descriptor.
    Then it uses the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet to count the number of audit records associated with each
    file. The result is a list of numbers representing the number of audit records for each log file.
  summary: |+
    This example gets the security descriptors of the `.log` files in the `C:\Windows` directory whose
    names begin with `s`.

- title: Example 4 - Get an ACL for a registry key
  code: |-
    Get-Acl -Path HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control | Format-List
  description: |-
    The **Path** parameter specifies the Control subkey. The pipeline operator (`|`) passes the security
    descriptor that `Get-Acl` gets to the `Format-List` command, which formats the properties of the
    security descriptor as a list so that they are easy to read.
  summary: |+
    This example uses the `Get-Acl` cmdlet to get the security descriptor of the Control subkey
    (`HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control`) of the registry.

- title: Example 5 - Get an ACL using **InputObject**
  code: |-
    Get-Acl -InputObject (Get-StorageSubSystem -Name S087)
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example uses the **InputObject** parameter of `Get-Acl` to get the security descriptor of a
    storage subsystem object.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Audit
  description: |+
    Gets the audit data for the security descriptor from the system access control list (SACL).

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Exclude
  description: |+
    Omits the specified items. The value of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter. Enter a
    path element or pattern, such as `*.txt`. Wildcards are permitted.

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Specifies a filter in the provider's format or language. The value of this parameter qualifies the
    **Path** parameter. The syntax of the filter, including the use of wildcards, depends on the
    provider. Filters are more efficient than other parameters, because the provider applies them when
    getting the objects, rather than having PowerShell filter the objects after they are retrieved.

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Include
  description: |+
    Gets only the specified items. The value of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter. Enter a
    path element or pattern, such as `*.txt`. Wildcards are permitted.

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.PSObject" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InputObject
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Gets the security descriptor for the specified object. Enter a variable that contains the object or
    a command that gets the object.

    You cannot pipe an object, other than a path, to `Get-Acl`. Instead, use the **InputObject**
    parameter explicitly in the command.

    This parameter is introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: LiteralPath
  description: |+
    Specifies the path to a resource. Unlike **Path**, the value of the **LiteralPath** parameter is
    used exactly as it is typed. No characters are interpreted as wildcards. If the path includes escape
    characters, enclose it in single quotation marks. Single quotation marks tell PowerShell not to
    interpret any characters as escape sequences.

    This parameter is introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: PSPath
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Path
  description: |+
    Specifies the path to a resource. `Get-Acl` gets the security descriptor of the resource indicated
    by the path. Wildcards are permitted. If you omit the **Path** parameter, `Get-Acl` gets the
    security descriptor of the current directory.

    The parameter name ("Path") is optional.

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: Microsoft.PowerShell.Security.Get-Acl
name: Get-Acl
description: |-
  The `Get-Acl` cmdlet gets objects that represent the security descriptor of a file or resource. The
  security descriptor contains the access control lists (ACLs) of the resource. The ACL specifies the
  permissions that users and user groups have to access the resource.

  Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, you can use the **InputObject** parameter of `Get-Acl` to get
  the security descriptor of objects that do not have a path.
