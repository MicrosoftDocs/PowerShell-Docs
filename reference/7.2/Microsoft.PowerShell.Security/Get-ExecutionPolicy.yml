### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Gets the execution policies for the current session.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Security
notes: |-
  An execution policy is part of the PowerShell security strategy. Execution policies determine
  whether you can load configuration files, such as your PowerShell profile, or run scripts. And,
  whether scripts must be digitally signed before they are run.

- title: 'Example 1: Get all execution policies'
  code: |-
    Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

    Scope          ExecutionPolicy
    -----          ---------------
    MachinePolicy  Undefined
    UserPolicy     Undefined
    Process        Undefined
    CurrentUser    AllSigned
    LocalMachine   Undefined
  description: |-
    The `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet uses the **List** parameter to display each scope's execution
    policy.
  summary: |+
    This command displays the execution policies for each scope in the order of precedence.

- title: 'Example 2: Set an execution policy'
  code: |-
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
    Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

    Scope ExecutionPolicy
            ----- ---------------
    MachinePolicy       Undefined
       UserPolicy       Undefined
          Process       Undefined
      CurrentUser       AllSigned
     LocalMachine    RemoteSigned
  description: |-
    The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the
    **RemoteSigned** policy. The **Scope** parameter specifies the default scope value,
    **LocalMachine**. To view the execution policy settings, use the `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet with
    the **List** parameter.
  summary: |+
    This example shows how to set an execution policy for the local computer.

- title: 'Example 3: Get the effective execution policy'
  code: |-
    PS> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List

            Scope ExecutionPolicy
            ----- ---------------
    MachinePolicy       Undefined
       UserPolicy       Undefined
          Process       Undefined
      CurrentUser       AllSigned
     LocalMachine    RemoteSigned

    PS> Get-ExecutionPolicy

    AllSigned
  description: |-
    The `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet uses the **List** parameter to display each scope's execution
    policy. The `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet is run without a parameter to display the effective
    execution policy, **AllSigned**.
  summary: |+
    This example shows how to display the effective execution policy for a PowerShell session.

- title: 'Example 4: Unblock a script to run it without changing the execution policy'
  code: |-
    PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine

    PS> Get-ExecutionPolicy

    RemoteSigned

    PS> .\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1

    .\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 : File .\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 cannot be loaded.
    The file .\Start-ActivityTracker.ps1 is not digitally signed.
    The script will not execute on the system.

    Task 1:
  description: |-
    The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` uses the **ExecutionPolicy** parameter to specify the **RemoteSigned**
    policy. The policy is set for the default scope, **LocalMachine**.

    The `Get-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet shows that **RemoteSigned** is the effective execution policy for
    the current PowerShell session.

    The **Start-ActivityTracker.ps1** script is executed from the current directory. The script is
    blocked by **RemoteSigned** because the script isn't digitally signed.

    For this example, the script's code was reviewed and verified as safe to run. The `Unblock-File`
    cmdlet uses the **Path** parameter to unblock the script.

    To verify that `Unblock-File` didn't change the execution policy, `Get-ExecutionPolicy` displays the
    effective execution policy, **RemoteSigned**.

    The script, **Start-ActivityTracker.ps1** is executed from the current directory. The script begins
    to run because it was unblocked by the `Unblock-File` cmdlet.
  summary: |+
    This example shows how the **RemoteSigned** execution policy prevents you from running unsigned
    scripts.

    A best practice is to read the script's code and verify it's safe **before** using the
    `Unblock-File` cmdlet. The `Unblock-File` cmdlet unblocks scripts so they can run, but doesn't
    change the execution policy.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: List
  description: |+
    Gets all execution policy values for the session listed in precedence order. By default,
    `Get-ExecutionPolicy` gets only the effective execution policy.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Microsoft.PowerShell.ExecutionPolicyScope" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Scope
  description: |+
    Specifies the scope that is affected by an execution policy.

    The effective execution policy is determined by the order of precedence as follows:

    - **MachinePolicy**. Set by a Group Policy for all users of the computer.
    - **UserPolicy**. Set by a Group Policy for the current user of the computer.
    - **Process**. Affects only the current PowerShell session.
    - **CurrentUser**. Affects only the current user.
    - **LocalMachine**. Default scope that affects all users of the computer.

  defaultValue: Effective execution policy
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: CurrentUser, LocalMachine, MachinePolicy, Process, UserPolicy
uid: Microsoft.PowerShell.Security.Get-ExecutionPolicy
name: Get-ExecutionPolicy
description: |-
  To display the execution policies for each scope in the order of precedence, use
  `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`. To see the effective execution policy for your PowerShell session use
  `Get-ExecutionPolicy` with no parameters.

  The effective execution policy is determined by execution policies that are set by
  `Set-ExecutionPolicy` and Group Policy settings.
