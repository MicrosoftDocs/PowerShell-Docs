### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Stops one or more running processes.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
notes: |-
  * You can also refer to **Stop-Process** by its built-in aliases, **kill** and **spps**. For more information, see about_Aliases.

    You can also use the properties and methods of the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) **Win32_Process** object in Windows PowerShell.
  For more information, see `Get-CimInstance` and the WMI SDK.

  * When stopping processes, realize that stopping a process can stop process and services that depend on the process.
  In an extreme case, stopping a process can stop Windows.
inputs:
- name: <xref href="System.Diagnostics.Process" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    You can pipe a process object to this cmdlet.
outputs:
- name: <xref href="None, System.Diagnostics.Process" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  description: |-
    This cmdlet returns a **System.Diagnostics.Process** object that represents the stopped process, if you specify the *PassThru* parameter.
    Otherwise, this cmdlet does not generate any output.

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Stop all instances of a process'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Stop-Process -Name "notepad"
  description: |-
    This command stops all instances of the Notepad process on the computer.
    Each instance of Notepad runs in its own process.
    It uses the *Name* parameter to specify the processes, all of which have the same name.
    If you were to use the *Id* parameter to stop the same processes, you would have to list the process IDs of each instance of Notepad.

  description: |-
    This command stops a particular instance of the Notepad process.
    It uses the process ID, 3952, to identify the process.
    The *Confirm* parameter directs PowerShell to prompt you before it stops the process.
    Because the prompt includes the process namein addition to its ID, this is best practice.
    The *PassThru* parameter passes the process object to the formatter for display.
    Without this parameter, there would be no display after a **Stop-Process** command.

- title: 'Example 3: Stop a process and detect that it has stopped'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> calc
    PS C:\> $p = Get-Process -Name "calc"
    PS C:\> Stop-Process -InputObject $p
    PS C:\> Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.HasExited}
  description: |-
    This series of commands starts and stops the Calc process, and then detects processes that have stopped.

    The first command starts an instance of the calculator.

    The second command uses **Get-Process** gets an object that represents the Calc process, and then stores it in the $p variable.

    The third command stops the Calc process.
    It uses the *InputObject* parameter to pass the object to **Stop-Process**.

    The last command gets all of the processes on the computer that were running but that are now stopped.
    It uses **Get-Process** to get all of the processes on the computer.
    The pipeline operator (|) passes the results to the Where-Object cmdlet, which selects the ones where the value of the **HasExited** property is $True.
    **HasExited** is just one property of process objects.
    To find all the properties, type `Get-Process | Get-Member`.

    [ADMIN]: PS C:\>
  description: |-
    These commands show the effect of using *Force* to stop a process that is not owned by the user.

    The first command uses **Get-Process** to get the Lsass process.
    A pipeline operator sends the process to **Stop-Process** to stop it.
    As shown in the sample output, the first command fails with an Access denied message, because this process can be stopped only by a member of the Administrator group on the computer.

    When PowerShell is opened by using the Run as administrator option, and the command is repeated, PowerShell prompts you for confirmation.

    The second command specifies *Force* to suppress the prompt.
    As a result, the process is stopped without confirmation.

    Stops the specified processes without prompting for confirmation.
    By default, **Stop-Process** prompts for confirmation before stopping any process that is not owned by the current user.

    To find the owner of a process, use the `Get-CimInstance` cmdlet to get a **Win32_Process** object that represents the process, and then use the **GetOwner** method of the object.

description: |-
  The **Stop-Process** cmdlet stops one or more running processes.
  You can specify a process by process name or process ID (PID), or pass a process object to **Stop-Process**.
  **Stop-Process** works only on processes running on the local computer.

  On Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system, to stop a process that is not owned by the current user, you must start PowerShell by using the Run as administrator option.
  Also, you are not prompted for confirmation unless you specify the *Confirm* parameter.
