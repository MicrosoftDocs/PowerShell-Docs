### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Creates temporary and persistent mapped network drives.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
notes: |-
  `New-PSDrive` is designed to work with the data exposed by any provider. To list the providers
  available in your session, use `Get-PSProvider`. For more information about providers, see
  [about_Providers](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Providers.md).

  Mapped network drives are specific to a user account. Mapped drives created in elevated sessions or
  sessions using the credential of another user aren't visible in sessions started using different
  credentials.

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Create a temporary drive mapped to a network share'
  code: |-
    New-PSDrive -Name "Public" -PSProvider "FileSystem" -Root "\\Server01\Public"

    Name       Provider      Root
    ----       --------      ----
    Public     FileSystem    \\Server01\Public
  description: |-
    `New-PSDrive` uses the **Name** parameter to specify PowerShell drive named `Public` and the
    **PSProvider** parameter to specify the PowerShell `FileSystem` provider. The **Root** parameter
    specifies the network share's UNC path.

    To view the contents from a PowerShell session: `Get-ChildItem -Path Public:`
  summary: |+
    This example creates a temporary PowerShell drive that's mapped to a network share.

- title: 'Example 2: Create a temporary drive mapped to a local directory'
  code: |-
    $parameters = @{
        Name = "MyDocs"
        PSProvider = "FileSystem"
        Root = "C:\Users\User01\Documents"
        Description = "Maps to my My Documents folder."
    }
    New-PSDrive @parameters

    Name        Provider      Root
    ----        --------      ----
    MyDocs      FileSystem    C:\Users\User01\Documents
  description: |-
    Splatting creates the parameter keys and values. The **Name** parameter specifies the drive name,
    **MyDocs**. The **PSProvider** parameter specifies the PowerShell `FileSystem` provider. **Root**
    specifies the local computer's directory. The **Description** parameter describes the drive's
    purpose. `New-PSDrive` uses the splatted parameters to create the `MyDocs` drive.

    To view the contents from a PowerShell session: `Get-ChildItem -Path MyDocs:`
  summary: |+
    This example creates a temporary PowerShell drive that provides access to a directory on the local
    computer.

- title: 'Example 3: Create a temporary drive for a registry key'
  code: |-
    New-PSDrive -Name "MyCompany" -PSProvider "Registry" -Root "HKLM:\Software\MyCompany"

    Name           Provider      Root
    ----           --------      ----
    MyCompany      Registry      HKLM:\Software\MyCompany
  description: |-
    `New-PSDrive` uses the **Name** parameter to specify PowerShell drive named `MyCompany` and the
    **PSProvider** parameter to specify the PowerShell `Registry` provider. The **Root** parameter
    specifies the registry location.

    To view the contents from a PowerShell session: `Get-ChildItem -Path MyCompany:`
  summary: |+
    This example creates a temporary PowerShell drive that provides access to a registry key. It creates
    a drive named MyCompany that is mapped to the `HKLM:\Software\MyCompany` registry key.

- title: 'Example 4: Create a persistent mapped network drive using credentials'
  code: |-
    $cred = Get-Credential -Credential Contoso\ServiceAccount
    New-PSDrive -Name "S" -Root "\\Server01\Scripts" -Persist -PSProvider "FileSystem" -Credential $cred
    Net Use

    Status       Local     Remote                    Network
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    OK           S:        \\Server01\Scripts        Microsoft Windows Network
  description: |-
    > [!NOTE]
    > Remember, if you use the above snippet in a script, set the **Scope** parameter value to
    > "Global" to ensure the drive persists outside the current scope.

    The `$cred` variable stores a **PSCredential** object that contains the service account's
    credentials. `Get-Credential` prompts you to enter the password that's stored in a **SecureString**.

    `New-PSDrive` creates the mapped network drive by using several parameters. **Name** specifies the
    `S` drive letter that Windows accepts. and **Root** defines `\\Server01\Scripts` as the location on
    a remote computer. **Persist** creates a Windows mapped network drive that's saved on the local
    computer. **PSProvider** specifies the `FileSystem` provider. **Credential** uses the `$cred`
    variable to get the service account credentials for authentication.

    The mapped drive can be viewed on the local computer in PowerShell sessions, File Explorer, and with
    tools such as **net use**. To view the contents from a PowerShell session: `Get-ChildItem -Path S:`
  summary: |+
    This example maps a network drive that's authenticated with a domain service account's credentials.
    For more information about the **PSCredential** object that stores credentials and how passwords are
    stored as a **SecureString**, see the **Credential** parameter's description.

  summary: |+
    This example shows the difference between a persistent mapped network drive and a temporary
    PowerShell drive that is mapped to the same network share.

    If you close the PowerShell session and then open a new session, the temporary `PSDrive:` isn't
    available, but the persistent `X:` drive is available. When deciding which method to use to map
    network drives, consider how you'll use the drive. For example, whether it has to be persistent, and
    whether the drive has to be visible to other Windows features.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

  defaultValue: "False"

  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies a user account that has permission to do this action. The default is the current user.

    Since PowerShell 3.0, when the value of the **Root** parameter is a UNC path, you can use
    credentials to create file system drives.

    Type a user name, such as **User01** or **Domain01\User01**, or enter a **PSCredential** object
    generated by the `Get-Credential` cmdlet. If you type a user name, you're prompted to enter the
    password.

    Credentials are stored in a [PSCredential](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential)
    object and the password is stored as a [SecureString](/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring).

  description: |+
    Specifies a name for the new drive. For persistent mapped network drives, use a drive letter. For
    temporary PowerShell drives, you aren't limited to drive letters, use any valid string.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Persist
  description: |+
    Indicates that this cmdlet creates a Windows mapped network drive. The **Persist** parameter is only
    available on Windows.

    Mapped network drives are saved in Windows on the local computer. They're persistent, not
    session-specific, and can be viewed and managed in File Explorer and other tools.

    When you scope the command locally, without dot-sourcing, the **Persist** parameter doesn't persist
    the creation of a **PSDrive** beyond the scope in which you run the command. If you run
    `New-PSDrive` inside a script, and you want the new drive to persist indefinitely, you must
    dot-source the script. For best results, to force a new drive to persist, specify **Global** as the
    value of the **Scope** parameter and include **Persist** in your command.

    The name of the drive must be a letter, such as `D` or `E`. The value of **Root** parameter must be
    a UNC path of a different computer. The **PSProvider** parameter's value must be `FileSystem`.

    To disconnect a Windows mapped network drive, use the `Remove-PSDrive` cmdlet. When you disconnect a
    Windows mapped network drive, the mapping is permanently deleted from the computer, not just deleted
    from the current session.

    Mapped network drives are specific to a user account. Mapped drives created in elevated sessions or
    sessions using the credential of another user aren't visible in sessions started using different
    credentials.

  defaultValue: "False"

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: PSProvider
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the PowerShell provider that supports drives of this kind.

    For example, if the drive is associated with a network share or file system directory, the
    PowerShell provider is `FileSystem`. If the drive is associated with a registry key, the provider is
    `Registry`.

    Temporary PowerShell drives can be associated with any PowerShell provider. Mapped network drives
    can be associated only with the `FileSystem` provider.

    To see a list of the providers in your PowerShell session, use the `Get-PSProvider` cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Root
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the data store location to which a PowerShell drive is mapped.

    For example, specify a network share, such as `\\Server01\Public`, a local directory, such as
    `C:\Program Files`, or a registry key, such as `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft`.

    Temporary PowerShell drives can be associated with a local or remote location on any supported
    provider drive. Mapped network drives can be associated only with a file system location on a remote
    computer.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true

  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Scope
  description: |+
    Specifies a scope for the drive. The acceptable values for this parameter are: **Global**,
    **Local**, and **Script**, or a number relative to the current scope. Scopes number 0 through the
    number of scopes. The current scope number is 0 and its parent is 1. For more information, see

description: |-
  The `New-PSDrive` cmdlet creates temporary and persistent drives that are mapped to or associated
  with a location in a data store, such as a network drive, a directory on the local computer, or a
  registry key, and persistent Windows mapped network drives that are associated with a file system
  location on a remote computer.

  Temporary drives exist only in the current PowerShell session and in sessions that you create in the
  current session. They can have any name that is valid in PowerShell and can be mapped to any local
  or remote resource. You can use temporary PowerShell drives to access data in the associated data
  store, just as you would do with any mapped network drive. You can change locations into the drive,
  by using `Set-Location`, and access the contents of the drive by using `Get-Item` or
  `Get-ChildItem`.

  Because temporary drives are known only to PowerShell, you can't access them by using File Explorer,
  Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), Component Object Model (COM), Microsoft .NET Framework, or
  with tools such as **net use**.

  The following features were added to `New-PSDrive` in PowerShell 3.0:

  - Mapped network drives. You can use the **Persist** parameter of `New-PSDrive` to create Windows
    mapped network drives. Unlike temporary PowerShell drives, Windows mapped network drives aren't
    session-specific. They're saved in Windows and they can be managed by using standard Windows
    tools, such as File Explorer and **net use**. Mapped network drives must have a drive-letter name
    and be connected to a remote file system location. When your command is scoped locally, no
    dot-sourcing, the **Persist** parameter doesn't persist the creation of a **PSDrive** beyond the
    scope in which the command is running. If you're running `New-PSDrive` inside a script, and you
    want the drive to persist indefinitely, you must dot-source the script. For best results, to force
    a new drive to persist indefinitely, add the **Scope** parameter to your command, and set its
    value to **Global**. For more information about dot-sourcing, see
    [about_Scripts](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Scripts.md#script-scope-and-dot-sourcing).
  - External drives. When an external drive is connected to the computer, PowerShell automatically
    adds a **PSDrive** to the file system that represents the new drive. You don't have to restart
    PowerShell. Similarly, when an external drive is disconnected from the computer, PowerShell
    automatically deletes the **PSDrive** that represents the removed drive.
  - Credentials for Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths.

  When the value of the **Root** parameter is a UNC path, such as `\\Server\Share`, the credential
  specified in the value of the **Credential** parameter is used to create the **PSDrive**. Otherwise,
  **Credential** isn't effective when you're creating new file system drives.

  Some code samples use splatting to reduce the line length and improve readability. For more
  information, see [about_Splatting](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Splatting.md).
