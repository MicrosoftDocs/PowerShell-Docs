# Test-WSMan

## SYNOPSIS
Tests whether the WinRM service is running on a local or remote computer.

## SYNTAX

```
Test-WSMan [[-ComputerName] <String>] [-Authentication <AuthenticationMechanism>] [-Port <Int32>] [-UseSSL]
 [-ApplicationName <String>] [-Credential <PSCredential>] [-CertificateThumbprint <String>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The **Test-WSMan** cmdlet submits an identification request that determines whether the WinRM service is running on a local or remote computer.
If the tested computer is running the service, the cmdlet displays the WS-Management identity schema, the protocol version, the product vendor, and the product version of the tested service.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Determine the status of the WinRM service

```
PS C:\> Test-WSMan
wsmid           : http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wsman/identity/1/wsmanidentity.xsd

ProtocolVersion : http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wsman/1/wsman.xsd

ProductVendor   : Microsoft Corporation

ProductVersion  : OS: 0.0.0 SP: 0.0 Stack: 2.0
```

This command determines whether the WinRM service is running on the local computer or on a remote computer.

### Example 2: Determine the status of the WinRM service on a remote computer

```
PS C:\> Test-WSMan -ComputerName "server01"
wsmid           : http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wsman/identity/1/wsmanidentity.xsd

ProtocolVersion : http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wsman/1/wsman.xsd

ProductVendor   : Microsoft Corporation

ProductVersion  : OS: 0.0.0 SP: 0.0 Stack: 2.0
```

This command determines whether the WinRM service is running on the server01 computer.

### Example 3: Determine the status of the WinRM service and the operating system version

```
PS C:\> Test-WSMan -Authentication default
wsmid           : http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wsman/identity/1/wsmanidentity.xsd

ProtocolVersion : http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wsman/1/wsman.xsd

ProductVendor   : Microsoft Corporation

ProductVersion  : OS: 6.0.6001 SP: 1.0 Stack: 2.0
```

This command tests to see whether the WS-Management (WinRM) service is running on the local computer by using the authentication parameter.

Using the authentication parameter enables **Test-WSMan** to return the operating system version.

### Example 4: Determine the status of the WinRM service and the operating system version on a remote computer

```
PS C:\> Test-WSMan -ComputerName "server01" -Authentication default
wsmid           : http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wsman/identity/1/wsmanidentity.xsd

ProtocolVersion : http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wsman/1/wsman.xsd

ProductVendor   : Microsoft Corporation

ProductVersion  : OS: 6.1.7021 SP: 0.0 Stack: 2.0
```

This command tests to see whether the WS-Management (WinRM) service is running on the computer named server01 using the authentication parameter.

Using the authentication parameter enables **Test-WSMan** to return the operating system version.

## PARAMETERS

### -ApplicationName

Specifies the application name in the connection.
The default value of the *ApplicationName* parameter is WSMAN.
The complete identifier for the remote endpoint is in the following format:

\<transport\>://\<server\>:\<port\>/\<ApplicationName\>

For example: `http://server01:8080/WSMAN`

Internet Information Services (IIS), which hosts the session, forwards requests with this endpoint to the specified application.
This default setting of WSMAN is appropriate for most uses.
This parameter is designed to be used if many computers establish remote connections to one computer that is running PowerShell.
In this case, IIS hosts Web Services for Management (WS-Management) for efficiency.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Authentication

Specifies the authentication mechanism to be used at the server.
The acceptable values for this parameter are:

- Basic.
Basic is a scheme in which the user name and password are sent in clear text to the server or proxy.
- Default.
Use the authentication method implemented by the WS-Management protocol.
This is the default.
- Digest.
Digest is a challenge-response scheme that uses a server-specified data string for the challenge.
- Kerberos.
The client computer and the server mutually authenticate by using Kerberos certificates.
- Negotiate.
Negotiate is a challenge-response scheme that negotiates with the server or proxy to determine the scheme to use for authentication.
For example, this parameter value allows for negotiation to determine whether the Kerberos protocol or NTLM is used.
- CredSSP.
Use Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) authentication, which lets the user delegate credentials.
This option is designed for commands that run on one remote computer but collect data from or run additional commands on other remote computers.

Caution: CredSSP delegates the user credentials from the local computer to a remote computer.
This practice increases the security risk of the remote operation.
If the remote computer is compromised, when credentials are passed to it, the credentials can be used to control the network session.

Important: If you do not specify the *Authentication* parameter,, the **Test-WSMan** request is sent to the remote computer anonymously, without using authentication.
If the request is made anonymously, it returns no information that is specific to the operating-system version.
Instead, this cmdlet displays null values for the operating system version and service pack level (OS: 0.0.0 SP: 0.0).

```yaml
Type: Microsoft.WSMan.Management.AuthenticationMechanism
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: auth, am
Accepted values: None, Default, Digest, Negotiate, Basic, Kerberos, ClientCertificate, Credssp

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -CertificateThumbprint

Specifies the digital public key certificate (X509) of a user account that has permission to perform this action.
Enter the certificate thumbprint of the certificate.

Certificates are used in client certificate-based authentication.
They can be mapped only to local user accounts; they do not work with domain accounts.

To get a certificate thumbprint, use the Get-Item or Get-ChildItem command in the PowerShell Cert: drive.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ComputerName

Specifies the computer against which to run the management operation.
The value can be a fully qualified domain name, a NetBIOS name, or an IP address.
Use the local computer name, use localhost, or use a dot (.) to specify the local computer.
The local computer is the default.
When the remote computer is in a different domain from the user, you must use a fully qualified domain name must be used.
You can pipe a value for this parameter to the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cn

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Credential

Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action.
The default is the current user.
Type a user name, such as User01, Domain01\User01, or User@Domain.com.
Or, enter a **PSCredential** object, such as one returned by the Get-Credential cmdlet.
When you type a user name, this cmdlet prompts you for a password.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cred, c

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Port

Specifies the port to use when the client connects to the WinRM service.
When the transport is HTTP, the default port is 80.
When the transport is HTTPS, the default port is 443.

When you use HTTPS as the transport, the value of the *ComputerName* parameter must match the server's certificate common name (CN).

```yaml
Type: System.Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UseSSL

Specifies that the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol is used to establish a connection to the remote computer.
By default, SSL is not used.

WS-Management encrypts all the PowerShell content that is transmitted over the network.
The *UseSSL* parameter lets you specify the additional protection of HTTPS instead of HTTP.
If SSL is not available on the port that is used for the connection, and you specify this parameter, the command fails.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

## NOTES

* By default, the **Test-WSMan** cmdlet queries the WinRM service without using authentication, and it returns no information that is specific to the operating-system version. Instead, it displays null values for the operating system version and service pack level (OS: 0.0.0 SP: 0.0).
