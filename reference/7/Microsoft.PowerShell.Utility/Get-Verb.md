# Get-Verb

## SYNOPSIS
Gets approved PowerShell verbs.

## SYNTAX

```
Get-Verb [[-Verb] <String[]>] [[-Group] <String[]>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Get-Verb` function gets verbs that are approved for use in PowerShell commands.

It is recommended that PowerShell cmdlet and function names have the `Verb-Noun`
format and include an approved verb. This practice makes command names more consistent,
predictable, and easier to use.

Commands that use unapproved verbs, still run in PowerShell. However, when you import a
module that includes a command with an unapproved verb in its name, the `Import-Module`
command displays a warning message.

> [!NOTE]
> The verb list that `Get-Verb` returns might not be complete. For an updated list of approved
> PowerShell verbs with descriptions, see
> [Approved Verbs](/powershell/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands) in
> the Microsoft Docs.

## NOTES

PowerShell verbs are assigned to a group based on their most common use.
The groups are designed to make the verbs easy to find and compare, not to restrict their use.
You can use any approved verb for any type of command.

Each PowerShell verb is assigned to one of the following groups.

- Common: Define generic actions that can apply to almost any cmdlet, such as Add.
- Communications: Define actions that apply to communications, such as Connect.
- Data: Define actions that apply to data handling, such as Backup.
- Diagnostic: Define actions that apply to diagnostics, such as Debug.
- Lifecycle: Define actions that apply to the lifecycle of a cmdlet, such as Complete.
- Security: Define actions that apply to security, such as Revoke.
- Other: Define other types of actions.

Some of the cmdlets that are installed with PowerShell, such as `Tee-Object` and `Where-Object`,
use unapproved verbs. These cmdlets are historic exceptions and their verbs are classified as
**reserved**.
