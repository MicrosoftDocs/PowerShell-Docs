```

## DESCRIPTION

If you saved the WS-Management session in a variable, the session object remains in the variable, but the state of the WS-Management session is Closed.
You can use this cmdlet within the context of the WSMan provider to disconnect the client from the WinRM service on a remote computer.
However, you can also use this cmdlet to disconnect from the WinRM service on remote computers before you change to the WSMan provider.

For more information about how to connect to the WinRM service on a remote computer, see Connect-WSMan.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Delete a connection to a remote computer
```
PS C:\> Disconnect-WSMan -computer server01
PS C:\> cd WSMan:
PS WSMan:\>
PS WSMan:\> dir

ComputerName                                  Type

localhost                                     Container
```

This command deletes the connection to the remote computer named server01.

This cmdlet is generally used within the context of the WSMan provider to disconnect from a remote computer, in this case the server01 computer.
