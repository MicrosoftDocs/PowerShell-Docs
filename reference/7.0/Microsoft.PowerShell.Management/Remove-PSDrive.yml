description: |-
  The `Remove-PSDrive` cmdlet deletes temporary PowerShell drives that were created by using the `New-PSDrive` cmdlet.

  Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, `Remove-PSDrive` also disconnects mapped network drives, including, but not limited to, drives created by using the `Persist` parameter of `New-PSDrive`.

  `Remove-PSDrive` cannot delete Windows physical or logical drives.

  Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, when an external drive is connected to the computer, PowerShell automatically adds a PSDrive to the file system that represents the new drive.
  You do not need to restart PowerShell.
  Similarly, when an external drive is disconnected from the computer, PowerShell automatically deletes the PSDrive that represents the removed drive.
