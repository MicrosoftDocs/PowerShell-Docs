# Set-Location

## SYNOPSIS
Sets the current working location to a specified location.

## SYNTAX

### Path (Default)

```
Set-Location [[-Path] <String>] [-PassThru] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### LiteralPath

```
Set-Location -LiteralPath <String> [-PassThru] [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Stack

```
Set-Location [-PassThru] [-StackName <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Set-Location` cmdlet sets the working location to a specified location. That location could be
a directory, a subdirectory, a registry location, or any provider path.

PowerShell 6.2 added support for `-` and `+` with the **Path** parameter. PowerShell maintains a
history of the last 20 locations that can be access with `-` and `+`. This list is independent from
the location stack that is accessed using the **StackName** parameter.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Set the current location

```
PS C:\> Set-Location -Path "HKLM:"
PS HKLM:\>
```

This command sets the current location to the root of the HKLM: drive.

### Example 2: Set the current location and display that location

```
PS C:\> Set-Location -Path "Env:" -PassThru
```

```Output
Path
----
Env:\

PS Env:\>
```

This command sets the current location to the root of the Env: drive. It uses the **PassThru**
parameter to direct PowerShell to return a **PathInfo** object that represents the Env: location.

### Example 3: Set location to the C: drive

```
PS Env:\> Set-Location C:
PS C:\>
```

This command sets the current location C: drive in the FileSystem provider.

### Example 4: Set the current location to a named stack

```
PS C:\> Set-Location 'C:\Program Files\PowerShell\' -StackName "WSManPaths"
```

This command makes the WSManPaths location stack the current location stack.

The `*-Location` cmdlets use the current location stack unless a different location stack is
specified in the command. For information about location stacks, see the Notes.

### Example 5: Navigate location history using `+` or `-`

```
PS C:\> Set-Location -Path $env:SystemRoot
PS C:\Windows> Set-Location -Path Cert:
PS Cert:\> Set-Location -Path HKLM:
PS HKLM:\>

# Navigate back through the history using "-"
PS HKLM:\> Set-Location -Path -
PS Cert:\> Set-Location -Path -
PS C:\Windows>

# Navigate using the Set-Location alias "cd" and the implicit positional Path parameter
PS C:\Windows> cd -
PS C:\> cd +
PS C:\Windows> cd +
PS Cert:\>
```

Using the alias, `cd -` or `cd +` is an easy way to navigate through your location history while
in your terminal. For more information on navigating with `-`/`+`, see the Path parameter.

## PARAMETERS

### -LiteralPath

Specifies a path of the location. The value of the **LiteralPath** parameter is used exactly as it
is typed. No characters are interpreted as wildcard characters. If the path includes escape
characters, enclose it in single quotation marks. Single quotation marks tell PowerShell not to
interpret any characters as escape sequences.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: LiteralPath
Aliases: PSPath, LP

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -PassThru

Returns a **PathInfo** object that represents the location. By default, this cmdlet does not
generate any output.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Path

Specify the path of a new working location. If no path is provided, `Set-Location` defaults to the
current user's home directory. When wildcards are used, the cmdlet chooses the first path that
matches the wildcard pattern.

PowerShell keeps a history of the last 20 locations you have set. If the path is the `-` character,
then the new working location will be the previous working location in history (if it exists).
Similarly, if the path is the `+` character, then the new working location will be the next working
location in history (if it exists). This is similar to using `Pop-Location` and `Push-Location`
except that the history is a list, not a stack, and is implicitly tracked, not manually controlled.
Currently, there is no way to view the history list.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: Path
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -StackName

Specifies the location stack name that this cmdlet makes the current location stack. Enter a
location stack name. To indicate the unnamed default location stack, type `$null` or an empty string
("").

The `*-Location` cmdlets act on the current stack unless you use the **StackName** parameter to
specify a different stack. For more information about location stacks, see the [Notes](#notes).

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: Stack
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: `-Debug`, `-ErrorAction`, `-ErrorVariable`,
`-InformationAction`, `-InformationVariable`, `-OutVariable`, `-OutBuffer`, `-PipelineVariable`,
`-Verbose`, `-WarningAction`, and `-WarningVariable`. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_CommonParameters.md).

## INPUTS

### System.String

You can pipe a string that contains a path, but not a literal path, to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### None, System.Management.Automation.PathInfo, System.Management.Automation.PathInfoStack

This cmdlet does not generate any output unless you specify the **PassThru** parameter. Using
**PassThru** with **Path** or **LiteralPath** generates a **PathInfo** object that represents the
new location. Using **PassThru** with **StackName** generates a **PathInfoStack** object
representing the new stack context.

## NOTES

PowerShell supports multiple runspaces per process. Each runspace has its own _current directory_.
This is not the same as `[System.Environment]::CurrentDirectory`. This behavior can be an issue
when calling .NET APIs or running native applications without providing explicit directory paths.

Even if the location cmdlets did set the process-wide current directory, you can't depend on it
because another runspace might change it at any time. You should use the location cmdlets to perform
path-based operations using the current working directory specific to the current runspace.

The `Set-Location` cmdlet is designed to work with the data exposed by any provider. To list the
providers available in your session, type `Get-PSProvider`. For more information, see
[about_Providers](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/about/about_Providers.md).

A stack is a last-in, first-out list in which only the most recently added item can be accessed. You
add items to a stack in the order that you use them, and then retrieve them for use in the reverse
order. PowerShell lets you store provider locations in location stacks. PowerShell creates an
unnamed default location stack. You can create multiple named location stacks. If you do not specify
a stack name, PowerShell uses the current location stack. By default, the unnamed default location
is the current location stack, but you can use the `Set-Location` cmdlet to change the current
location stack.

To manage location stacks, use the `*-Location` cmdlets, as follows:

- To add a location to a location stack, use the `Push-Location` cmdlet.

- To get a location from a location stack, use the `Pop-Location` cmdlet.

- To display the locations in the current location stack, use the **Stack** parameter of the
  `Get-Location` cmdlet. To display the locations in a named location stack, use the **StackName**
  parameter of `Get-Location`.

- To create a new location stack, use the **StackName** parameter of `Push-Location`. If you specify
  a stack that does not exist, `Push-Location` creates the stack.

- To make a location stack the current location stack, use the **StackName** parameter of
  `Set-Location`.

The unnamed default location stack is fully accessible only when it is the current location stack.
If you make a named location stack the current location stack, you can no longer use the
`Push-Location` or `Pop-Location` cmdlets to add or get items from the default stack or use the
`Get-Location` cmdlet to display the locations in the unnamed stack. To make the unnamed stack
the current stack, use the **StackName** parameter of the `Set-Location` cmdlet with a value of
`$null` or an empty string (`""`).
