### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Restarts the operating system on local and remote computers.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
notes: |-
  This cmdlet is only available on Windows platforms.

  - `Restart-Computer` only works on computers running Windows and requires WinRM and WMI to shutdown
    a system, including the local system.
  - `Restart-Computer` uses the [Win32Shutdown method](/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32shutdown-method-in-class-win32-operatingsystem)
    of the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) [Win32_OperatingSystem](/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-operatingsystem)
    class. This method requires the **SeShutdownPrivilege** privilege be enabled for the user account
    used to restart the machine.

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Restart the local computer'
  code: |-
    Restart-Computer
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    `Restart-Computer` restarts the local computer.

- title: 'Example 2: Restart multiple computers'
  code: |-
    Restart-Computer -ComputerName Server01, Server02, localhost
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    `Restart-Computer` can restart remote and local computers. The **ComputerName** parameter accepts an
    array of computer names.

- title: 'Example 3: Get computer names from a text file'
  code: |-
    Get-Content -Path C:\Domain01.txt | Restart-Computer
  description: |-
    `Get-Content` uses the **Path** parameter to get a list of computer names from a text file,
    **Domain01.txt**. The computer names are sent down the pipeline. `Restart-Computer` restarts each
    computer.
  summary: |+
    `Restart-Computer` gets a list of computer names from a text file and restarts the computers. The
    **ComputerName** parameter isn't specified. But because it's the first position parameter, it
    accepts the computer names from the text file that are sent down the pipeline.

- title: 'Example 4: Force restart of computers listed in a text file'
  code: |-
    $Names = Get-Content -Path C:\Domain01.txt
    $Creds = Get-Credential
    Restart-Computer -ComputerName $Names -Credential $Creds -Force
  description: |-
    `Get-Content` uses the **Path** parameter to get a list of computer names from a text file,
    **Domain01.txt**. The computer names are stored in the variable `$Names`. `Get-Credential` prompts
    you for a username and password and stores the values in the variable `$Creds`. `Restart-Computer`
    uses the **ComputerName** and **Credential** parameters with their variables. The **Force**
    parameter causes an immediate restart of each computer.
  summary: |+
    This example forces an immediate restart of the computers listed in the `Domain01.txt` file. The
    computer names from the text file are stored in a variable. The **Force** parameter forces an
    immediate restart.

- title: 'Example 6: Restart a remote computer and wait for PowerShell'
  code: |-
    Restart-Computer -ComputerName Server01 -Wait -For PowerShell -Timeout 300 -Delay 2
  description: |-
    `Restart-Computer` uses the **ComputerName** parameter to specify **Server01**. The **Wait**
    parameter waits for the restart to finish. The **For** specifies that PowerShell can run commands on
    the remote computer. The **Timeout** parameter specifies a five-minute wait. The **Delay** parameter
    queries the remote computer every two seconds to determine whether it's restarted.
  summary: |+
    `Restart-Computer` restarts the remote computer and then waits up to 5 minutes (300 seconds) for
    PowerShell to become available on the restarted computer before it continues.

- title: 'Example 7: Restart a computer by using WsmanAuthentication'
  code: |-
    Restart-Computer -ComputerName Server01 -WsmanAuthentication Kerberos
  description: |-
    `Restart-Computer` uses the **ComputerName** parameter to specify the remote computer, **Server01**.
    The **WsmanAuthentication** parameter specifies the authentication method as **Kerberos**.
  summary: |+
    `Restart-Computer` restarts the remote computer using the **WsmanAuthentication** mechanism.
    Kerberos authentication determines whether the current user has permission to restart the remote
    computer. For more information, see
    [AuthenticationMechanism](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.runspaces.authenticationmechanism).

parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: ComputerName
  description: |+
    Specifies one computer name or a comma-separated array of computer names. `Restart-Computer` accepts
    **ComputerName** objects from the pipeline or variables.

    Type the NetBIOS name, an IP address, or a fully qualified domain name of a remote computer. To
    specify the local computer, type the computer name, a dot `.`, or localhost.

    This parameter doesn't rely on PowerShell remoting. You can use the **ComputerName** parameter even
    if your computer isn't configured to run remote commands.

    If the **ComputerName** parameter isn't specified, `Restart-Computer` restarts the local computer.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: CN, __SERVER, Server, IPAddress
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Confirm
  description: |+
    Prompts you for confirmation before running `Restart-Computer`.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: cf
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.PSCredential" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Credential
  description: |+
    Specifies a user account that has permission to do this action. The default is the current user.

    Type a user name, such as **User01** or **Domain01\User01**, or enter a **PSCredential** object
    generated by the `Get-Credential` cmdlet. If you type a user name, you're prompted to enter the
    password.

    Credentials are stored in a [PSCredential](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential)
    object and the password is stored as a [SecureString](/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring).

    > [!NOTE]
    > For more information about **SecureString** data protection, see
    > [How secure is SecureString?](/dotnet/api/system.security.securestring#how-secure-is-securestring).

  defaultValue: Current user
  position: "1"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Int16" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Delay
  description: |+
    Specifies the frequency of queries, in seconds. PowerShell queries the service specified by the
    **For** parameter to determine whether the service is available after the computer is restarted.

    This parameter is valid only together with the **Wait** and **For** parameters.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

    If the **Delay** parameter isn't specified, `Restart-Computer` uses a five second delay.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WaitForServiceTypes" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: For
  description: |+
    Specifies the behavior of PowerShell as it waits for the specified service or feature to become
    available after the computer restarts. This parameter is only valid with the **Wait** parameter.

    The acceptable values for this parameter are:

    - **Default**: Waits for PowerShell to restart.
    - **PowerShell**: Can run commands in a PowerShell remote session on the computer.
    - **WMI**: Receives a reply to a Win32_ComputerSystem query for the computer.
    - **WinRM**: Can establish a remote session to the computer by using WS-Management.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Wmi, WinRM, PowerShell
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Forces an immediate restart of the computer.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: f
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Int32" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Timeout
  description: |+
    Specifies the duration of the wait, in seconds. When the timeout elapses, `Restart-Computer` returns
    to the command prompt, even if the computers aren't restarted.

    The **Timeout** parameter is only valid with the **Wait** parameter. **Timeout** overrides the
    **Wait** parameter's indefinite waiting period.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: TimeoutSec
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Wait
  description: |+
    `Restart-Computer` suppresses the PowerShell prompt and blocks the pipeline until the computers have
    restarted. You can use this parameter in a script to restart computers and then continue to process
    when the restart is finished.

    The **Wait** parameter waits indefinitely for the computers to restart. You can use **Timeout** to
    adjust the timing and the **For** and **Delay** parameters to wait for particular services to become
    available on the restarted computers.

    The **Wait** parameter isn't valid when you're restarting the local computer. If the value of the
    **ComputerName** parameter contains the names of remote computers and the local computer,
    `Restart-Computer` generates a non-terminating error for **Wait** on the local computer, but waits
    for the remote computers to restart.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the `Restart-Computer` runs. The `Restart-Computer` cmdlet isn't run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WsmanAuthentication
  description: |+
    Specifies the mechanism that is used to authenticate the user credentials. This parameter was
    introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

    The acceptable values for this parameter are: **Basic**, **CredSSP**, **Default**, **Digest**,
    **Kerberos**, and **Negotiate**.

    For more information, see
    [AuthenticationMechanism](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.runspaces.authenticationmechanism).

    > [!WARNING]
    > Credential Security Service Provider (CredSSP) authentication, in which the user credentials are
    > passed to a remote computer to be authenticated, is designed for commands that require
    > authentication on more than one resource, such as accessing a remote network share. This mechanism
    > increases the security risk of the remote operation. If the remote computer is compromised, the
    > credentials that are passed to it can be used to control the network session.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: Basic, CredSSP, Default, Digest, Kerberos, Negotiate
uid: Microsoft.PowerShell.Management.Restart-Computer
name: Restart-Computer
description: |-
  The `Restart-Computer` cmdlet restarts the operating system on the local and remote computers.

  You can use the parameters of `Restart-Computer` to run the restart operations, to specify the
  authentication levels and alternate credentials, to limit the operations that run at the same time,
  and to force an immediate restart.

  Starting in Windows PowerShell 3.0, you can wait for the restart to complete before you run the next
  command. Specify a waiting time-out and query interval, and wait for particular services to be
  available on the restarted computer. This feature makes it practical to use `Restart-Computer` in
  scripts and functions.
