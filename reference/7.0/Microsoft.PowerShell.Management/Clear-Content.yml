### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Deletes the contents of an item, but does not delete the item.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
notes: |-
  You can use `Clear-Content` with the PowerShell FileSystem provider and with other providers that
  manipulate content. To clear items that are not considered to be content, such as items managed by
  the PowerShell Certificate or Registry providers, use `Clear-Item`.

  The `Clear-Content` cmdlet is designed to work with the data exposed by any provider.
  To list the providers available in your session, type `Get-PsProvider`.
  For more information, see [about_Providers](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Providers.md).

examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Delete all content from a directory'
  code: |-
    Clear-Content "..\SmpUsers\*\init.txt"
  description: |-
    This command deletes all of the content from the "init.txt" files in all subdirectories of the SmpUsers directory.
    The files are not deleted, but they are empty.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Delete content of all files with a wildcard'
  code: |-
    Clear-Content -Path "*" -Filter "*.log" -Force
  description: |-
    This command deletes the contents of all files in the current directory with the ".log" file name
    extension, including files with the read-only attribute. The asterisk (\*) in the path represents
    all items in the current directory. The **Force** parameter makes the command effective on read-only
    files. Using a filter to restrict the command to files with the .log file name extension instead of
    specifying \*.log in the path makes the operation faster.

  summary: |+
    This example shows how the `Clear-Content` cmdlet clears the content from an alternate data stream
    while leaving the stream intact.

    The first command uses the `Get-Content` cmdlet to get the content of the `Zone.Identifier` stream
    in the Copy-Script.ps1 file, which was downloaded from the Internet.

    The second command uses the `Clear-Content` cmdlet to clear the content.

    The third command repeats the first command. It verifies that the content is cleared, but the stream
    remains. If the stream were deleted, the command would generate an error.

    You can use a method like this one to clear the content of an alternate data stream. However, it is
    not the recommended way to eliminate security checks that block files that are downloaded from the
    Internet. If you verify that a downloaded file is safe, use the `Unblock-File` cmdlet.

parameters:

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Exclude
  description: |+
    Specifies, as a string array, strings that this cmdlet omits from the path to the content. The value
    of this parameter qualifies the **Path** parameter. Enter a path element or pattern, such as
    "*.txt". Wildcards are permitted.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Filter
  description: |+
    Specifies a filter in the provider's format or language. The value of this parameter qualifies the
    **Path** parameter. The syntax of the filter, including the use of wildcards, depends on the
    provider. Filters are more efficient than other parameters, because the provider applies them when
    retrieving the objects, rather than having PowerShell filter the objects after they are retrieved.

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Force
  description: |+
    Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.

  name: Include
  description: |+
    Specifies, as a string array, content that this cmdlet clears. The value of this parameter qualifies
    the **Path** parameter. Enter a path element or pattern, such as "*.txt". Wildcards are permitted.

  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: LiteralPath
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the paths to the items from which content is deleted. Unlike the **Path** parameter, the
    value of **LiteralPath** is used exactly as it is typed. No characters are interpreted as wildcards.
    If the path includes escape characters, enclose it in single quotation marks. Single quotation marks
    tell having PowerShell not to interpret any characters as escape sequences.

  defaultValue: None
  pipelineInput: true
  position: Named
  aliases: PSPath, LP
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" /><span>[</span><span>]</span>
  name: Path
  isRequired: true
  description: |+
    Specifies the paths to the items from which content is deleted. Wildcards are permitted. The paths
    must be paths to items, not to containers. For example, you must specify a path to one or more
    files, not a path to a directory. Wildcards are permitted. This parameter is required, but the
    parameter name ("Path") is optional.

  defaultValue: None
  acceptWildcardCharacters: true
  pipelineInput: true
  position: "0"
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: Stream
  description: |+
    > [!NOTE]
    > This Parameter is only available on Windows.

    Specifies an alternative data stream for content. If the stream does not exist, this cmdlet creates
    it. Wildcard characters are not supported.

    Stream is a dynamic parameter that the FileSystem provider adds to `Clear-Content`.
    This parameter works only in file system drives.

    You can use the `Clear-Content` cmdlet to change the content of amy alternate data stream, such as
    `Zone.Identifier`. However, we do not recommend this as a way to eliminate security checks that
    block files that are downloaded from the Internet. If you verify that a downloaded file is safe, use
    the `Unblock-File` cmdlet.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: WhatIf
  description: |+
    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs. The cmdlet is not run.

  defaultValue: "False"
  position: Named
  aliases: wi
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: Microsoft.PowerShell.Management.Clear-Content
name: Clear-Content
description: |-
  The `Clear-Content` cmdlet deletes the contents of an item, such as deleting the text from a file, but it does not delete the item.
  As a result, the item exists, but it is empty.
  The `Clear-Content` is similar to `Clear-Item`, but it works on items with contents, instead of items with values.
