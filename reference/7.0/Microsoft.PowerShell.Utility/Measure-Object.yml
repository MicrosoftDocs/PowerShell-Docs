examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Count the files and folders in a directory'
  code: |-
    Get-ChildItem | Measure-Object
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This command counts the files and folders in the current directory.

- title: 'Example 2: Measure the files in a directory'
  code: |-
    Get-ChildItem | Measure-Object -Property length -Minimum -Maximum -Average
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This command displays the **Minimum**, **Maximum**, and **Sum** of the sizes of all files in the
    current directory, and the average size of a file in the directory.

- title: 'Example 3: Measure text in a text file'
  code: |-
    "One", "Two", "Three", "Four" | Set-Content -Path C:\Temp\tmp.txt
    Get-Content C:\Temp\tmp.txt | Measure-Object -Character -Line -Word

    Lines Words Characters Property
    ----- ----- ---------- --------
        4     4         15
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This command displays the number of characters, words, and lines in the Text.txt file.
    Without the **Raw** parameter, `Get-Content` outputs the file as an array of lines.

    The first command uses `Set-Content` to add some default text to a file.

- title: 'Example 4: Measure objects containing a specified Property'
  code: |-
    $services = Get-Service
    $processes = Get-Process
    $services + $processes | Measure-Object
    $services + $processes | Measure-Object -Property DisplayName

    Count    : 682
    Average  :
    Sum      :
    Maximum  :
    Minimum  :
    Property :

    Count    : 290
    Average  :
    Sum      :
    Maximum  :
    Minimum  :
    Property : DisplayName
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example counts the number of objects that have a **DisplayName** property. The first two
    commands retrieve all the services and processes on the local machine. The third command counts the
    combined number of services and processes. The last command combines the two collections and pipes
    the result to `Measure-Object`.

    The **System.Diagnostics.Process** object does not have a **DisplayName** property, and is left out
    of the final count.

- title: 'Example 5: Measure the contents of a CSV file'
  code: |-
    Import-Csv d:\test\serviceyrs.csv | Measure-Object -Property years -Minimum -Maximum -Average
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This command calculates the average years of service of the employees of a company.

    The `ServiceYrs.csv` file is a CSV file that contains the employee number and years of service of
    each employee. The first row in the table is a header row of **EmpNo**, **Years**.

    When you use `Import-Csv` to import the file, the result is a **PSCustomObject** with note
    properties of **EmpNo** and **Years**.
    You can use `Measure-Object` to calculate the values of these properties, just like any other
    property of an object.

- title: 'Example 6: Measure Boolean values'
  code: |-
    Get-ChildItem | Measure-Object -Property psiscontainer -Maximum -Sum -Minimum -Average

    Count             : 126
    Average           : 0.0634920634920635
    Sum               : 8
    Maximum           : 1
    Minimum           : 0
    StandardDeviation :
    Property          : PSIsContainer
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example demonstrates how the `Measure-Object` can measure Boolean values.
    In this case, it uses the **PSIsContainer** **Boolean** property to measure the incidence of
    folders (vs. files) in the current directory.

- title: 'Example 7: Measure strings'
  code: |-
    # The newline character `n separates the string into separate lines, as shown in the output.
    "One`nTwo`nThree"
    "One`nTwo`nThree" | Measure-Object -Line

    One
    Two
    Three


    Lines Words Characters Property
    ----- ----- ---------- --------
        3

    # The first string counts as a single line.
    # The second string is separated into two lines by the newline character.
    "One", "Two`nThree" | Measure-Object -Line

    Lines Words Characters Property
    ----- ----- ---------- --------
        3

    # The Word switch counts the number of words in each InputObject
    # Each InputObject is treated as a single line.
    "One, Two", "Three", "Four Five" | Measure-Object -Word -Line

    Lines Words Characters Property
    ----- ----- ---------- --------
        3     5
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    The following example measures the number of lines, first a single string, then across several
    strings. The newline character <code>`n</code> separates strings into multiple lines.

- title: 'Example 8: Measure all the values'
  code: |-
    1..5 | Measure-Object -AllStats

    Count             : 5
    Average           : 3
    Sum               : 15
    Maximum           : 5
    Minimum           : 1
    StandardDeviation : 1.58113883008419
    Property          :
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    Beginning in PowerShell 6, the **AllStats** parameter of `Measure-Object` allows you to measure all
    the statistics together.

- title: 'Example 9: Measure using scriptblock properties'
  code: |-
    Get-ChildItem | Measure-Object -Sum {$_.Length/1MB}
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    Beginning in PowerShell 6, `Measure-Object` supports **ScriptBlock** properties. The following
    example demonstrates how to use a **ScriptBlock** property to determine the size, in MegaBytes, of
    all the files in a directory.

- title: 'Example 10: Measure hashtables'
  code: |-
    @{num=3}, @{num=4}, @{num=5} | Measure-Object -Maximum Num

    Count             : 3
    Average           :
    Sum               :
    Maximum           : 5
    Minimum           :
    StandardDeviation :
    Property          : num
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    Beginning in PowerShell 6, `Measure-Object` supports measurement of **hashtable** input. The
    following example determines the largest value for the `num` key of 3 **hashtable** objects.

- title: 'Example 11: Measure the Standard Deviation'
  code: |-
    Get-Process | Measure-Object -Average -StandardDeviation CPU

    Count             : 303
    Average           : 163.032384488449
    Sum               :
    Maximum           :
    Minimum           :
    StandardDeviation : 859.444048419069
    Property          : CPU
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    Beginning in PowerShell 6, `Measure-Object` supports the `-StandardDeviation` parameter. The
    following example determines the *standard deviation* for the CPU used by all processes. A large
    deviation would indicate a small number of processes consuming the most CPU.

- title: 'Example 12: Measure using wildcards'
  code: |-
    Get-Process | Measure-Object -Maximum *paged*memory*size

    Count             : 303

    property names. The following example determines the maximum of any type of paged memory usage among
    a set of processes.

description: |-
  The `Measure-Object` cmdlet calculates the property values of certain types of object.
  `Measure-Object` performs three types of measurements, depending on the parameters in the command.

  The `Measure-Object` cmdlet performs calculations on the property values of objects. You can use
  `Measure-Object` to count objects or count objects with a specified **Property**. You can also use
  `Measure-Object` to calculate the **Minimum**, **Maximum**, **Sum**, **StandardDeviation** and
  **Average** of numeric values. For **String** objects, you can also use `Measure-Object` to
  count the number of lines, words, and characters.
