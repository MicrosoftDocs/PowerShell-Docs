examples:
- title: 'Example 1: Get all breakpoints for all scripts and functions'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-PSBreakpoint
  description: |-
    This command gets all breakpoints set on all scripts and functions in the current session.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 2: Get breakpoints by ID'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-PSBreakpoint -Id 2
    Function   :
    IncrementAction     :
    Enabled    :
    TrueHitCount   : 0
    Id         : 2
    Script     : C:\ps-test\sample.ps1
    ScriptName : C:\ps-test\sample.ps1
  description: |-
    This command gets the breakpoint with breakpoint ID 2.
  summary: ""
- title: 'Example 3: Pipe an ID to Get-PSBreakpoint'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> $B = Set-PSBreakpoint -Script "sample.ps1" -Command "Increment"
    PS C:\> $B.Id | Get-PSBreakpoint
  description: |-
    These commands show how to get a breakpoint by piping a breakpoint ID to **Get-PSBreakpoint**.

    The first command uses the Set-PSBreakpoint cmdlet to create a breakpoint on the Increment function
    in the Sample.ps1 script. It saves the breakpoint object in the $B variable.

    The second command uses the dot operator (.) to get the Id property of the breakpoint object in the
    $B variable. It uses a pipeline operator (|) to send the ID to the **Get-PSBreakpoint** cmdlet.

    As a result, **Get-PSBreakpoint** gets the breakpoint with the specified ID.

- title: 'Example 4: Get breakpoints in specified script files'
  code: |-
    PS C:\> Get-PSBreakpoint -Script "Sample.ps1, SupportScript.ps1"
  description: |-
    This command gets all of the breakpoints in the Sample.ps1 and SupportScript.ps1 files.

    This command does not get other breakpoints that might be set in other scripts or on functions in
    the session.

  The **Get-PSBreakPoint** cmdlet gets the breakpoints that are set in the current session.
  You can use the cmdlet parameters to get particular breakpoints.

  A breakpoint is a point in a command or script where execution stops temporarily so that you can
  examine the instructions.
  **Get-PSBreakpoint** is one of several cmdlets designed for debugging PowerShell scripts and
  commands. For more information about the PowerShell debugger, see about_Debuggers.
