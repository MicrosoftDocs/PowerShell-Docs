### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Selects objects or object properties.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
notes: |-
  - You can also refer to the `Select-Object` cmdlet by its built-in alias, `select`. For more
    information, see [about_Aliases](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Aliases.md).

  - The optimization feature of `Select-Object` is available only for commands that write objects to
    the pipeline as they are processed. It has no effect on commands that buffer processed objects and
    write them as a collection. Writing objects immediately is a cmdlet design best practice. For more
    information, see _Write Single Records to the Pipeline_ in
    [Strongly Encouraged Development Guidelines](/powershell/scripting/developer/windows-powershell).

  summary: |+
    This example gets information about the modules used by the processes on the computer. It uses
    `Get-Process` cmdlet to get the process on the computer.

    It uses the `Select-Object` cmdlet to output an array of `[System.Diagnostics.ProcessModule]`
    instances as contained in the **Modules** property of each `System.Diagnostics.Process` instance
    output by `Get-Process`.

    The **Property** parameter of the `Select-Object` cmdlet selects the process names. This adds a
    `ProcessName` **NoteProperty** to every `[System.Diagnostics.ProcessModule]` instance and populates
    it with the value of current process's **ProcessName** property.

    Finally, `Format-List` cmdlet is used to display the name and modules of each process in a list.

  summary: |+
    This example gets the five processes that are using the most memory. The `Get-Process` cmdlet gets
    the processes on the computer. The `Sort-Object` cmdlet sorts the processes according to memory
    (working set) usage, and the `Select-Object` cmdlet selects only the last five members of the
    resulting array of objects.

    The **Wait** parameter is not required in commands that include the `Sort-Object` cmdlet because
    `Sort-Object` processes all objects and then returns a collection. The `Select-Object` optimization
    is available only for commands that return objects individually as they are processed.

- title: 'Example 4: Select unique characters from an array'
  code: |-
    "a","b","c","a","a","a" | Select-Object -Unique

    a
    b
    c
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example uses the **Unique** parameter of `Select-Object` to get unique characters from an array
    of characters.

- title: 'Example 5: Select newest and oldest events in the event log'
  code: |-
    $a = Get-EventLog -LogName "Windows PowerShell"
    $a | Select-Object -Index 0, ($A.count - 1)
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example gets the first (newest) and last (oldest) events in the Windows PowerShell event log.

    `Get-EventLog` gets all events in the Windows PowerShell log and saves them in the `$a` variable.
    Then, `$a` is piped to the `Select-Object` cmdlet. The `Select-Object` command uses the **Index**
    parameter to select events from the array of events in the `$a` variable. The index of the first
    event is 0. The index of the last event is the number of items in `$a` minus 1.

- title: 'Example 6: Select all but the first object'
  code: |-
    New-PSSession -ComputerName (Get-Content Servers.txt | Select-Object -Skip 1)
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example creates a new PSSession on each of the computers listed in the Servers.txt files,
    except for the first one.

    `Select-Object` selects all but the first computer in a list of computer names. The resulting list
    of computers is set as the value of the **ComputerName** parameter of the `New-PSSession` cmdlet.

- title: 'Example 7: Rename files and select several to review'
  code: |-
    Get-ChildItem *.txt -ReadOnly |
        Rename-Item -NewName {$_.BaseName + "-ro.txt"} -PassThru |
        Select-Object -First 5 -Wait
  description: ""
  summary: |+
    This example adds a "-ro" suffix to the base names of text files that have the read-only attribute
    and then displays the first five files so the user can see a sample of the effect.

    `Get-ChildItem` uses the **ReadOnly** dynamic parameter to get read-only files. The resulting files
    are piped to the `Rename-Item` cmdlet, which renames the file. It uses the **Passthru** parameter of
    `Rename-Item` to send the renamed files to the `Select-Object` cmdlet, which selects the first 5 for
    display.

    The **Wait** parameter of `Select-Object` prevents PowerShell from stopping the `Get-ChildItem`
    cmdlet after it gets the first five read-only text files. Without this parameter, only the first
    five read-only files would be renamed.

    This example demonstrates the intricacies of the **ExpandProperty** parameter.

    Note that the output generated was an array of `[System.Int32]` instances. The instances conform to
    standard formatting rules of the **Output View**. This is true for any *Expanded* properties. If the
    outputted objects have a specific standard format, the expanded property might not be visible.

  description: ""
  summary: |+
    The following example demonstrates using `Select-Object` to add a custom property to any object.
    When you specify a property name that does not exist, `Select-Object` creates that property as a
    **NoteProperty** on each object passed.

  summary: |+
    This example demonstrates using `Select-Object` to add calculated properties to your input. Passing
    a **ScriptBlock** to the **Property** parameter causes `Select-Object` to evaluate the expression on
    each object passed and add the results to the output. Within the **ScriptBlock**, you can use the
    `$_` variable to reference the current object in the pipeline.

    By default, `Select-Object` will use the **ScriptBlock** string as the name of the property. Using a
    **Hashtable**, you can label the output of your **ScriptBlock** as a custom property added to each
    object. You can add multiple calculated properties to each object passed to `Select-Object`.

- type: <xref href="System.String" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: ExpandProperty
  description: |+
    Specifies a property to select, and indicates that an attempt should be made to expand that
    property.

    - If the specified property is an array, each value of the array is included in the output.
    - If the specified property is an object, the objects properties are expanded for every
      **InputObject**

    In either case, the **Type** of objects output will match the **Type** of the expanded property.

    If the **Property** parameter is specified, `Select-Object` will attempt to add each selected
    property as a **NoteProperty** to every outputted object.

    > [!WARNING]
    > If you receive the error: Select : Property cannot be processed because property `<PropertyName>`
    > already exists, consider the following.
    > Note that when using `-ExpandProperty`, `Select-Object` can not replace an existing property.
    > This means:
    >
    > - If the expanded object has a property of the same name, an error will occur.

  name: InputObject
  description: |+
    Specifies objects to send to the cmdlet through the pipeline. This parameter enables you to pipe
    objects to `Select-Object`.

    When you pass objects to the **InputObject** parameter, instead of using the pipeline,
    `Select-Object` treats the **InputObject** as a single object, even if the value is a collection. It
    is recommended that you use the pipeline when passing collections to `Select-Object`.

    Specifies the properties to select. These properties are added as **NoteProperty** members to the
    output objects. Wildcards are permitted.

    The value of the **Property** parameter can be a new calculated property. To create a calculated,
    property, use a hash table.

    Valid keys are:

    - Name (or Label) - `<string>`
    - Expression - `<string>` or `<script block>`

  name: Skip
  description: |+
    Skips (does not select) the specified number of items. By default, the **Skip** parameter counts
    from the beginning of the array or list of objects, but if the command uses the **Last** parameter,
    it counts from the end of the list or array.

    Unlike the **Index** parameter, which starts counting at 0, the **Skip** parameter begins at 1.

  name: Wait
  description: |+
    Indicates that the cmdlet turns off optimization. PowerShell runs commands in the order that they
    appear in the command pipeline and lets them generate all objects. By default, if you include a
    `Select-Object` command with the **First** or **Index** parameters in a command pipeline, PowerShell
    stops the command that generates the objects as soon as the selected number of objects is generated.

    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.

  defaultValue: None
  position: Named
  aliases: ""
  parameterValueGroup: ""
uid: Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.Select-Object
name: Select-Object
description: |-
  The `Select-Object` cmdlet selects specified properties of an object or set of objects. It can also
  select unique objects, a specified number of objects, or objects in a specified position in an
  array.

  To select objects from a collection, use the **First**, **Last**, **Unique**, **Skip**, and
  **Index** parameters. To select object properties, use the **Property** parameter. When you select
  properties, `Select-Object` returns new objects that have only the specified properties.

  Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, `Select-Object` includes an optimization feature that prevents
  commands from creating and processing objects that are not used.

  When you include a `Select-Object` command with the **First** or **Index** parameters in a command
  pipeline, PowerShell stops the command that generates the objects as soon as the selected number of
  objects is generated, even when the command that generates the objects appears before the
  `Select-Object` command in the pipeline. To turn off this optimizing behavior, use the **Wait**
  parameter.
