# Register-EngineEvent

## SYNOPSIS
Subscribes to events that are generated by the PowerShell engine and by the `New-Event` cmdlet.

## SYNTAX

```
Register-EngineEvent [-SourceIdentifier] <String> [[-Action] <ScriptBlock>] [-MessageData <PSObject>]
 [-SupportEvent] [-Forward] [-MaxTriggerCount <Int32>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Register-EngineEvent` cmdlet subscribes to events that are generated by the PowerShell engine
and the `New-Event` cmdlet. Use the **SourceIdentifier** parameter to specify the event.

You can use this cmdlet to subscribe to the **Exiting** engine event and events generated by the
`New-Event` cmdlet. These events are automatically added to your event queue in your session without
subscribing. However, subscribing lets you forward the events, specify an action to respond to the
events, and cancel the subscription.

When the subscribed event is raised, it is added to the event queue in your session. To get events
in the event queue, use the `Get-Event` cmdlet.

When you subscribe to a event, an event subscriber is added to your session. To get the event
subscribers in the session, use the `Get-EventSubscriber` cmdlet. To cancel the subscription, use
the `Unregister-Event` cmdlet, which deletes the event subscriber from the session.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Register a PowerShell engine event on remote computers

This example registers for a PowerShell engine event on two remote computers.

```powershell
$S = New-PSSession -ComputerName "Server01, Server02"
Invoke-Command -Session $S { Register-EngineEvent -SourceIdentifier ([System.Management.Automation.PsEngineEvent]::Exiting) -Forward }
```

`New-PSSession` creates a user-managed session (PSSession) on each of the remote computers.The
`Invoke-Command` cmdlet runs the `Register-EngineEvent` command in the remote sessions.
`Register-EngineEvent` uses the **SourceIdentifier** parameter to identify the event. The
**Forward** parameter tell the engine to forward the events from the remote session to the local
session.

### Example 2: Take a specified action when the Exiting event occurs

This example shows how to run `Register-EngineEvent` to take a specific action when the
**PowerShell.Exiting** event occurs.

```powershell
Register-EngineEvent -SourceIdentifier PowerShell.Exiting -SupportEvent -Action {
    Get-History | Export-Clixml $Home\history.clixml
}
```

The **SupportEvent** parameter is added to hide the event subscription. When PowerShell exits, in
this case, the command history from the exiting session is exported an XML file in the user's
`$Home` directory.

### Example 3: Create and subscribe to a user-defined event

This example creates a subscription for events from the source **MyEventSource**. This is an
arbitrary source that we are going to use to monitor the progress of a job. `Register-EngineEvent`
is used to create the subscription. The script block for the **Action** parameter logs the event
data to a text file.

```powershell
Register-EngineEvent -SourceIdentifier MyEventSource -Action {
    "Event: {0}" -f $event.messagedata | Out-File c:\temp\MyEvents.txt -Append
}

Start-Job -Name TestJob -ScriptBlock {
    While ($True) {
        Register-EngineEvent -SourceIdentifier MyEventSource -Forward
        Start-Sleep -seconds 2
        "Doing some work..."
        New-Event -SourceIdentifier MyEventSource -Message ("{0} -  Work done..." -f (Get-Date))
    }
}
Start-Sleep -seconds 4
Get-EventSubscriber
Get-Job
```

```Output
SubscriptionId   : 12
SourceObject     :
EventName        :
SourceIdentifier : MyEventSource
Action           : System.Management.Automation.PSEventJob
HandlerDelegate  :
SupportEvent     : False
ForwardEvent     : False

Id     Name            PSJobTypeName   State         HasMoreData     Location             Command
--     ----            -------------   -----         -----------     --------             -------
18     MyEventSource                   Running       True                                 …
19     TestJob         BackgroundJob   Running       True            localhost            …
```

`Register-EngineEvent` created Job Id 18. `Start-Job` created Job Id 19. In Example #4, we remove
the event subscription and the jobs, then inspect the log file.

### Example 4: Unregister events and clean up jobs

This is a continuation of Example 3. In this example we wait for 10 seconds to let several events
occur. Then we unregister the event subscription.

```powershell
PS> Start-Sleep -seconds 10
PS> Get-EventSubscriber | Unregister-Event
PS> Get-Job

Id     Name            PSJobTypeName   State         HasMoreData     Location             Command
--     ----            -------------   -----         -----------     --------             -------
18     MyEventSource                   Stopped       False                                …
19     TestJob         BackgroundJob   Running       True            localhost            …

PS> Stop-Job -Id 19
PS> Get-Job | Remove-Job
PS> Get-Content C:\temp\MyEvents.txt
Event: 2/18/2020 2:36:19 PM -  Work done...
Event: 2/18/2020 2:36:21 PM -  Work done...
Event: 2/18/2020 2:36:23 PM -  Work done...
Event: 2/18/2020 2:36:25 PM -  Work done...
Event: 2/18/2020 2:36:27 PM -  Work done...
Event: 2/18/2020 2:36:29 PM -  Work done...
Event: 2/18/2020 2:36:31 PM -  Work done...
```

The `Unregister-Event` cmdlet stops the job associated with the event subscription (Job Id 18). Job
Id 19 is still running and creating new events. We use the **Job** cmdlets stop the job and remove
the unneeded job objects. `Get-Content` displays the contents of the log file.

## PARAMETERS

### -Action

Specifies commands to handle the events. The commands in the **Action** run when an event is raised,
instead of sending the event to the event queue. Enclose the commands in braces ( { } ) to create a
script block.

The value of the **Action** parameter can include the `$Event`, `$EventSubscriber`, `$Sender`,
`$EventArgs`, and `$Args` automatic variables, which provide information about the event to the
**Action** script block. For more information, see
[about_Automatic_Variables](../Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Automatic_Variables.md).

When you specify an action, `Register-EngineEvent` returns an event job object that represents that
action. You can use the Job cmdlets to manage the event job.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 101
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Forward

Indicates that the cmdlet sends events for this subscription to the session on the local computer.
Use this parameter when you are registering for events on a remote computer or in a remote session.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MaxTriggerCount

Specifies the maximum number of times that the action will be executed for the event subscription.

```yaml
Type: System.Int32
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -MessageData

Specifies additional data associated with the event. The value of this parameter appears in the
**MessageData** property of the event object.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.PSObject
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SourceIdentifier

Specifies the source identifier of the event to which you are subscribing. The source identifier
must be unique in the current session. This parameter is required.

The value of this parameter appears in the value of the **SourceIdentifier** property of the
subscriber object and of all event objects associated with this subscription.

The value is specific to the source of the event. This can be an arbitrary value you created to use
with the `New-Event` cmdlet. The PowerShell engine supports the **EngineEvent** values
**PowerShell.Exiting** and **PowerShell.OnIdle**.

```yaml
Type: System.String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 100
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SupportEvent

Indicates that the cmdlet hides the event subscription. Add this parameter when the current
subscription is part of a more complex event registration mechanism and it should not be discovered
independently.

To view or cancel a subscription that was created with the **SupportEvent** parameter, add the
**Force** parameter to the `Get-EventSubscriber` or `Unregister-Event` cmdlets.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable,
-InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose,
-WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see
[about_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### None

You cannot pipe input to `Register-EngineEvent`.

## OUTPUTS

### None or System.Management.Automation.PSEventJob

If you use the **Action** parameter, `Register-EngineEvent` returns a
**System.Management.Automation.PSEventJob** object. Otherwise, it does not generate any output.

## NOTES

No event sources available on the Linux or macOS platforms.

Events, event subscriptions, and the event queue exist only in the current session. If you close the
current session, the event queue is discarded and the event subscription is canceled.
