  `PSConsoleHostReadLine` is the main entry point for the PSReadLine module. The PowerShell console
  host automatically loads the PSReadLine module and calls this function. Under normal operating
  conditions, this function is not intended to be used from the command line.

  The extension point `PSConsoleHostReadLine` is special to the console host. The host calls any
  alias, function, or script with this name. PSReadLine defines this function so that it is called
  from the console host.
