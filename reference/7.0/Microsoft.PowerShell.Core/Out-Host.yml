### YamlMime:PowershellCmdlet
summary: |-
  Sends output to the command line.
module: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core
notes: |-
  The **Paging** parameter isn't supported by all PowerShell hosts. For example, if you use the
  **Paging** parameter in the PowerShell ISE, the following error is displayed:
  `out-lineoutput : The method or operation is not implemented.`

  The cmdlets that contain the **Out** verb, `Out-`, don't format objects. They render objects and
  send them to the specified display destination. If you send an unformatted object to an `Out-`
  cmdlet, the cmdlet sends it to a formatting cmdlet before rendering it.

  The `Out-` cmdlets don't have parameters for names or file paths. To send data to an `Out-` cmdlet,
  use the pipeline to send a PowerShell command's output to the cmdlet. Or, you can store data in a
  variable and use the **InputObject** parameter to pass the data to the cmdlet.

  `Out-Host` sends data, but it doesn't produce any output objects. If you pipeline the output of
  `Out-Host` to the `Get-Member` cmdlet, `Get-Member` reports that no objects have been specified.
inputs:
- name: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.PSObject" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />

    You can send objects down the pipeline to `Out-Host`.
outputs:

    `Out-Host` doesn't generate any output. It sends objects to the host for display.

    `Get-Process` gets the system processes and sends the objects down the pipeline. `Out-Host` uses the
    **Paging** parameter to display one page of data at a time.
  summary: |+
    This example displays the system processes one page at a time.

  code: |-
    $io = Get-History
    Out-Host -InputObject $io
  description: |-
    `Get-History` gets the PowerShell session's history, and stores the objects in the `$io` variable.
    `Out-Host` uses the **InputObject** parameter to specify the `$io` variable and displays the
    history.
  summary: |+
    This example uses objects stored in a variable as the input for `Out-Host`.

parameters:
- type: <xref href="System.Management.Automation.PSObject" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" />
  name: InputObject
  description: |+
    Specifies the objects that are written to the console. Enter a variable that contains the objects,
    or type a command or expression that gets the objects.

  name: Paging
  description: |+
    Indicates that `Out-Host` displays one page of output at a time, and waits for user input before the
    remaining pages are displayed. By default, all the output is displayed on a single page. The page
    size is determined by the characteristics of the host.

    Press the <kbd>Space</kbd> bar to display the next page of output or the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to
    view the next line of output. Press <kbd>Q</kbd> to quit.

    **Paging** is similar to the **more** command.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Paging** parameter isn't supported by the PowerShell ISE host.

description: |-
  The `Out-Host` cmdlet sends output to the PowerShell host for display. The host displays the output
  at the command line. Because `Out-Host` is the default, you don't have to specify it unless you want
  to use its parameters.

  `Out-Host` is automatically appended to every command that is executed. It passes the output of the
  pipeline to the host executing the command. `Out-Host` ignores ANSI escape sequences. The escape
  sequences are handled by the host. `Out-Host` passes ANSI escape sequences to the host without
  trying to interpret or change them.
