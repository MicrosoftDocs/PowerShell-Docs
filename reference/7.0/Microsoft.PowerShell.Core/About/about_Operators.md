# About Operators

## Short description
Describes the operators that are supported by PowerShell.

## Long description

An operator is a language element that you can use in a command or expression.
PowerShell supports several types of operators to help you manipulate values.

### Arithmetic Operators

Use arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) to calculate values in a
command or expression. With these operators, you can add, subtract, multiply,
or divide values, and calculate the remainder (modulus) of a division
operation.

The addition operator concatenates elements. The multiplication operator
returns the specified number of copies of each element. You can use arithmetic
operators on any .NET type that implements them, such as: `Int`, `String`,
`DateTime`, `Hashtable`, and Arrays.

Bitwise operators (`-band`, `-bor`, `-bxor`, `-bnot`, `-shl`, `-shr`)
manipulate the bit patterns in values.

For more information, see [about_Arithmetic_Operators](about_Arithmetic_Operators.md).

### Assignment Operators

Use assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`) to assign, change,
or append values to variables. You can combine arithmetic operators with
assignment to assign the result of the arithmetic operation to a variable.

For more information, see [about_Assignment_Operators](about_Assignment_Operators.md).

### Comparison Operators

Use comparison operators (`-eq`, `-ne`, `-gt`, `-lt`, `-le`, `-ge`) to compare
values and test conditions. For example, you can compare two string values to
determine whether they are equal.

The comparison operators also include operators that find or replace patterns
in text. The (`-match`, `-notmatch`, `-replace`) operators use regular
expressions, and (`-like`, `-notlike`) use wildcards `*`.

Containment comparison operators determine whether a test value appears in a
reference set (`-in`, `-notin`, `-contains`, `-notcontains`).

Type comparison operators (`-is`, `-isnot`) determine whether an object is of a
given type.

For more information, see [about_Comparison_Operators](about_Comparison_Operators.md).

### Logical Operators

Use logical operators (`-and`, `-or`, `-xor`, `-not`, `!`) to connect
conditional statements into a single complex conditional. For example, you can
use a logical `-and` operator to create an object filter with two different
conditions.

For more information, see [about_Logical_Operators](about_logical_operators.md).

### Redirection Operators

Use redirection operators (`>`, `>>`, `2>`, `2>>`, and `2>&1`) to send the
output of a command or expression to a text file. The redirection operators
work like the `Out-File` cmdlet (without parameters) but they also let you
redirect error output to specified files. You can also use the `Tee-Object`
cmdlet to redirect output.

For more information, see [about_Redirection](about_Redirection.md)

### Split and Join Operators

The `-split` and `-join` operators divide and combine substrings. The `-split`
operator splits a string into substrings. The `-join` operator concatenates
multiple strings into a single string.

For more information, see [about_Split](about_Split.md) and
[about_Join](about_Join.md).

### Type Operators

Use the type operators (`-is`, `-isnot`, `-as`) to find or change the .NET
Framework type of an object.

For more information, see [about_Type_Operators](about_Type_Operators.md).

### Unary Operators

Use unary operators to increment or decrement variables or object properties
and to set integers to positive or negative numbers. For example, to increment
the variable `$a` from `9` to `10`, you type `$a++`.

### Special Operators

Special operators have specific use-cases that do not fit into any other
operator group. For example, special operators allow you to run commands,
change a value's data type, or retrieve elements from an array.

#### Grouping operator `( )`

As in other languages, `(...)` serves to override operator precedence in
expressions. For example: `(1 + 2) / 3`

However, in PowerShell, there are additional behaviors.

- `(...)` allows you to let output from a _command_ participate in an expression. For example:

  ```powershell
  PS> (Get-Item *.txt).Count -gt 10
  True
  ```

- When used as the first segment of a pipeline, wrapping a command or
  expression in parentheses invariably causes _enumeration_ of the expression
  result. If the parentheses wrap a _command_, it is run to completion with all
  output _collected in memory_ before the results are sent through the
  pipeline.

#### Subexpression operator `$( )`

Returns the result of one or more statements. For a single result, returns a
scalar. For multiple results, returns an array. Use this when you want to use
an expression within another expression. For example, to embed the results of
command in a string expression.

```powershell
PS> "Today is $(Get-Date)"
Today is 12/02/2019 13:15:20

PS> "Folder list: $((dir c:\ -dir).Name -join ', ')"
Folder list: Program Files, Program Files (x86), Users, Windows
```

#### Array subexpression operator `@( )`

Returns the result of one or more statements as an array. If there is only one
item, the array has only one member.

```powershell
@(Get-CimInstance win32_logicalDisk)
```

#### Call operator `&`

Runs a command, script, or script block. The call operator, also known as the
"invocation operator", lets you run commands that are stored in variables and
represented by strings or script blocks. The call operator executes in a child
scope. For more about scopes, see [about_Scopes](about_Scopes.md).

This example stores a command in a string and executes it using the call
operator.

```
PS> $c = "get-executionpolicy"
PS> $c
get-executionpolicy
PS> & $c
AllSigned
```

The call operator does not parse strings. This means that you cannot use
command parameters within a string when you use the call operator.

```
PS> $c = "Get-Service -Name Spooler"
PS> $c
Get-Service -Name Spooler
PS> & $c
& : The term 'Get-Service -Name Spooler' is not recognized as the name of a
cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of
the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and
try again.
```

The [Invoke-Expression](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.Invoke-Expression)
cmdlet can execute code that causes parsing errors when using the call
operator.

```
PS> & "1+1"
& : The term '1+1' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script
file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was
included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
At line:1 char:2
+ & "1+1"
+  ~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (1+1:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
PS> Invoke-Expression "1+1"
2
```

You can use the call operator to execute scripts using their filenames. The
example below shows a script filename that contains spaces. When you try to
execute the script, PowerShell instead displays the contents of the quoted
string containing the filename. The call operator allows you to execute the
contents of the string containing the filename.

```
PS C:\Scripts> Get-ChildItem

    Directory: C:\Scripts


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                -------------         ------ ----
-a----        8/28/2018   1:36 PM             58 script name with spaces.ps1

PS C:\Scripts> ".\script name with spaces.ps1"
.\script name with spaces.ps1
PS C:\Scripts> & ".\script name with spaces.ps1"
Hello World!
```

For more about script blocks, see [about_Script_Blocks](about_Script_Blocks.md).

#### Background operator `&`

Runs the pipeline before it in the background, in a PowerShell job. This
operator acts similarly to the UNIX control operator ampersand (`&`), which
runs the command before it asynchronously in subshell as a job.

This operator is functionally equivalent to `Start-Job`. By default, the
background operator starts the jobs in the current working directory of the
caller that started the parallel tasks. The following example demonstrates
basic usage of the background job operator.

```powershell
Get-Process -Name pwsh &
```

That command is functionally equivalent to the following usage of `Start-Job`:

```powershell
Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-Process -Name pwsh}
```

Just like `Start-Job`, the `&` background operator returns a `Job` object. This
object can be used with `Receive-Job` and `Remove-Job`, just as if you had used
`Start-Job` to start the job.

```powershell
$job = Get-Process -Name pwsh &
Receive-Job $job -Wait
```

```Output

 NPM(K)    PM(M)      WS(M)     CPU(s)      Id  SI ProcessName
 ------    -----      -----     ------      --  -- -----------
      0     0.00     221.16      25.90    6988 988 pwsh
      0     0.00     140.12      29.87   14845 845 pwsh
      0     0.00      85.51       0.91   19639 988 pwsh

```

```powershell
Remove-Job $job
```

The `&` background operator is also a statement terminator, just like the UNIX
control operator ampersand (`&`). This allows you to invoke additional commands
after the `&` background operator. The following example demonstrates the
invocation of additional commands after the `&` background operator.

```powershell
$job = Get-Process -Name pwsh & Receive-Job $job -Wait
```

```Output

 NPM(K)    PM(M)      WS(M)     CPU(s)      Id  SI ProcessName
 ------    -----      -----     ------      --  -- -----------
      0     0.00     221.16      25.90    6988 988 pwsh
      0     0.00     140.12      29.87   14845 845 pwsh
      0     0.00      85.51       0.91   19639 988 pwsh

```

This is equivalent to the following script:

```powershell
$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {Get-Process -Name pwsh}
Receive-Job $job -Wait
```

If you want to run multiple commands, each in their own background process but
all on one line, simply place `&` between and after each of the commands.

```powershell
Get-Process -Name pwsh & Get-Service -Name BITS & Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystem &
```

For more information on PowerShell jobs, see [about_Jobs](about_Jobs.md).

#### Cast operator `[ ]`

Converts or limits objects to the specified type. If the objects cannot be
converted, PowerShell generates an error.

```powershell
[DateTime]"2/20/88" - [DateTime]"1/20/88"
[Int] (7/2)
[String] 1 + 0
[Int] '1' + 0
```

A cast can also be performed when a variable is assigned to using [cast notation](about_Variables.md).

#### Comma operator `,`

As a binary operator, the comma creates an array. As a unary operator, the
comma creates an array with one member. Place the comma before the member.

```powershell
$myArray = 1,2,3
$SingleArray = ,1
```

#### Dot sourcing operator `.`

Runs a script in the current scope so that any functions, aliases, and
variables that the script creates are added to the current scope.

```powershell
. c:\scripts\sample.ps1
```

> [!NOTE]
> The dot sourcing operator is followed by a space. Use the space to
> distinguish the dot from the dot (`.`) symbol that represents the current
> directory.

In the following example, the Sample.ps1 script in the current directory is run
in the current scope.

```powershell
. .\sample.ps1
```

#### Format operator `-f`

Formats strings by using the format method of string objects. Enter the format
string on the left side of the operator and the objects to be formatted on the
right side of the operator.

```powershell
"{0} {1,-10} {2:N}" -f 1,"hello",[math]::pi
```

```output
1 hello      3.14
```

If you need to keep the curly braces (`{}`) in the formatted string, you can
escape them by doubling the curly braces.

```powershell
"{0} vs. {{0}}" -f 'foo'
```

```Output
foo vs. {0}
```

For more information, see the [String.Format](/dotnet/api/system.string.format)
method and [Composite Formatting](/dotnet/standard/base-types/composite-formatting).

#### Index operator `[ ]`

Selects objects from indexed collections, such as arrays and hash tables. Array
indexes are zero-based, so the first object is indexed as `[0]`. For arrays
(only), you can also use negative indexes to get the last values. Hash tables
are indexed by key value.

```
PS> $a = 1, 2, 3
PS> $a[0]
1
PS> $a[-1]
3
```

```powershell
(Get-HotFix | Sort-Object installedOn)[-1]
```

```powershell
$h = @{key="value"; name="PowerShell"; version="2.0"}
$h["name"]
```

```output
PowerShell
```

```powershell
$x = [xml]"<doc><intro>Once upon a time...</intro></doc>"
$x["doc"]
```

```output
intro
-----
Once upon a time...
```

#### Pipeline operator `|`

Sends ("pipes") the output of the command that precedes it to the command that
follows it. When the output includes more than one object (a "collection"), the
pipeline operator sends the objects one at a time.

```powershell
Get-Process | Get-Member
Get-Service | Where-Object {$_.StartType -eq 'Automatic'}
```

#### Pipeline chain operators `&&` and `||`

Conditionally execute the right-hand side pipeline based on the success of the
left-hand side pipeline.

```powershell
# If Get-Process successfully finds a process called notepad,
# Stop-Process -Name notepad is called
Get-Process notepad && Stop-Process -Name notepad
```

```powershell
# If npm install fails, the node_modules directory is removed
npm install || Remove-Item -Recurse ./node_modules
```

For more information, see [About_Pipeline_Chain_Operators](About_Pipeline_Chain_Operators.md).

#### Range operator `..`

Represents the sequential integers in an integer array, given an upper, and
lower boundary.

```powershell
1..10
foreach ($a in 1..$max) {Write-Host $a}
```

You can also create ranges in reverse order.

```powershell
10..1
5..-5 | ForEach-Object {Write-Output $_}
```

Beginning in PowerShell 6, the range operator works with **Characters** as
well as **Integers**.

To create a range of characters, enclose the boundary characters in quotes.

```powershell
PS> 'a'..'f'
a
b
c
d
e
f
```

```powershell
PS> 'F'..'A'
F
E
D
C
B
A
```

#### Member access operator `.`

Accesses the properties and methods of an object. The member name may be an
expression.

```powershell
$myProcess.peakWorkingSet
(Get-Process PowerShell).kill()
'OS', 'Platform' | Foreach-Object { $PSVersionTable. $_ }
```

#### Static member operator `::`

Calls the static properties and methods of a .NET Framework class. To
find the static properties and methods of an object, use the Static parameter
of the `Get-Member` cmdlet.  The member name may be an expression.

```powershell
[datetime]::Now
'MinValue', 'MaxValue' | Foreach-Object { [int]:: $_ }
```

#### Ternary operator `? <if-true> : <if-false>`

You can use the ternary operator as a replacement for the `if-else` statement
in simple conditional cases.

For more information, see [about_If](about_If.md).

#### Null-coalescing operator `??`

The null-coalescing operator `??` returns the value of its left-hand operand if
it isn't null. Otherwise, it evaluates the right-hand operand and returns its
result. The `??` operator doesn't evaluate its right-hand operand if the
left-hand operand evaluates to non-null.

```powershell
$x = $null
$x ?? 100
```

```Output
100
```

In the following example, the right-hand operand won't be evaluated.

```powershell
[string] $todaysDate = '1/10/2020'
$todaysDate ?? (Get-Date).ToShortDateString()
```

```Output
1/10/2020
```

#### Null-coalescing assignment operator `??=`

The null-coalescing assignment operator `??=` assigns the value of its
right-hand operand to its left-hand operand only if the left-hand operand
evaluates to null. The `??=` operator doesn't evaluate its right-hand operand
if the left-hand operand evaluates to non-null.

```powershell
$x = $null
$x ??= 100
$x
```

```Output
100
```

In the following example, the right-hand operand won't be evaluated.

```powershell
[string] $todaysDate = '1/10/2020'
$todaysDate ??= (Get-Date).ToShortDateString()
```

```Output
1/10/2020
```

#### Null-conditional operators `?.` and `?[]`

> [!NOTE]
> This is an experimental feature. For more information see
> [about_Experimental_Features](about_Experimental_Features.md).

A null-conditional operator applies a member access, `?.`, or element access,
`?[]`, operation to its operand only if that operand evaluates to non-null;
otherwise, it returns null.

Since PowerShell allows `?` to be part of the variable name, formal
specification of the variable name is required for using these operators. So it
is required to use `{}` around the variable names like `${a}` or when `?` is
part of the variable name `${a?}`.

In the following example, the value of **PropName** is returned.

```powershell
$a = @{ PropName = 100 }
${a}?.PropName
```

```Output
100
```

The following example will return null, without trying to access the member
name **PropName**.

```powershell
$a = $null
${a}?.PropName
```

Similarly, the value of the element will be returned.

```powershell
$a = 1..10
${a}?[0]
```

```Output
1
```

And when the operand is null, the element isn't accessed and null is returned.

```PowerShell
$a = $null
${a}?[0]
```
