# About Preference Variables

## Short description

Variables that customize the behavior of PowerShell.

## Long description

PowerShell includes a set of variables that enable you to customize its
behavior. These preference variables work like the options in GUI-based
systems.

The preference variables affect the PowerShell operating environment and all
commands run in the environment. In many cases, the cmdlets have parameters
that you can use to override the preference behavior for a specific command.

The following table lists the preference variables and their default values.

|             Variable             |       Default Value       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `$ConfirmPreference`             | High                      |
| `$DebugPreference`               | SilentlyContinue          |
| `$ErrorActionPreference`         | Continue                  |
| `$ErrorView`                     | ConciseView               |
| `$FormatEnumerationLimit`        | 4                         |

| `$LogCommandHealthEvent`         | False (not logged)        |
| `$LogCommandLifecycleEvent`      | False (not logged)        |
| `$LogEngineHealthEvent`          | True (logged)             |
| `$LogEngineLifecycleEvent`       | True (logged)             |
| `$LogProviderLifecycleEvent`     | True (logged)             |
| `$LogProviderHealthEvent`        | True (logged)             |
| `$MaximumHistoryCount`           | 4096                      |
| `$OFS`                           | (Space character (`" "`)) |
| `$OutputEncoding`                | UTF8Encoding object       |
| `$ProgressPreference`            | Continue                  |
| `$PSDefaultParameterValues`      | (None - empty hash table) |
| `$PSEmailServer`                 | (None)                    |
| `$PSModuleAutoLoadingPreference` | All                       |
| `$PSSessionApplicationName`      | wsman                     |
| `$PSSessionConfigurationName`    | `http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell` |
| `$PSSessionOption`               | See [$PSSessionOption](#pssessionoption) |
| `$Transcript`                    | (none)                    |
| `$VerbosePreference`             | SilentlyContinue          |
| `$WarningPreference`             | Continue                  |
| `$WhatIfPreference`              | False                     |

PowerShell includes the following environment variables that store user
preferences. For more information about these environment variables, see
[about_Environment_Variables](about_Environment_Variables.md).

- `env:PSExecutionPolicyPreference`
- `$env:PSModulePath`

> [!NOTE]
> Changes to preference variable only take effect in scripts and functions if
> those scripts or functions are defined in the same scope as the scope in
> which preference was used. For more information, see
> [about_Scopes](about_Scopes.md).

## Working with preference variables

This document describes each of the preference variables.

To display the current value of a specific preference variable, type the
variable's name. For example, the following command displays the
`$ConfirmPreference` variable's value.

```powershell
 $ConfirmPreference
```

```Output
High
```

To change a variable's value, use an assignment statement. For example, the
following statement changes the `$ConfirmPreference` parameter's value to
**Medium**.

```powershell
$ConfirmPreference = "Medium"
```

The values that you set are specific to the current PowerShell session. To make
variables effective in all PowerShell sessions, add them to your PowerShell
profile. For more information, see [about_Profiles](about_Profiles.md).

## Working remotely

When you run commands on a remote computer, the remote commands are only
subject to the preferences set in the remote computer's PowerShell client. For
example, when you run a remote command, the value of the remote computer's
`$DebugPreference` variable determines how PowerShell responds to debugging
messages.

For more information about remote commands, see [about_Remote](about_Remote.md).

### \$ConfirmPreference

Determines whether PowerShell automatically prompts you for confirmation before
running a cmdlet or function.

The `$ConfirmPreference` variable's valid values are **High**, **Medium**, or
**Low**. Cmdlets and functions are assigned a risk of **High**, **Medium**, or
**Low**. When the value of the `$ConfirmPreference` variable is less than or
equal to the risk assigned to a cmdlet or function, PowerShell automatically
prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet or function.

If the value of the `$ConfirmPreference` variable is **None**, PowerShell never
automatically prompts you before running a cmdlet or function.

To change the confirming behavior for all cmdlets and functions in the session,
change `$ConfirmPreference` variable's value.

To override the `$ConfirmPreference` for a single command, use a cmdlet's or
function's **Confirm** parameter. To request confirmation, use `-Confirm`. To
suppress confirmation, use `-Confirm:$false`.

Valid values of `$ConfirmPreference`:

- **None**: PowerShell doesn't prompt automatically. To request confirmation of
  a particular command, use the **Confirm** parameter of the cmdlet or
  function.
- **Low**: PowerShell prompts for confirmation before running cmdlets or
  functions with a low, medium, or high risk.
- **Medium**: PowerShell prompts for confirmation before running cmdlets or
  functions with a medium, or high risk.
- **High**: PowerShell prompts for confirmation before running cmdlets or
  functions with a high risk.

#### Detailed explanation

PowerShell can automatically prompt you for confirmation before doing an
action. For example, when cmdlet or function significantly affects the system
to delete data or use a significant amount of system resources.

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path C:\file.txt
```

```Output
Confirm
Are you sure you want to perform this action?
Performing operation "Remove File" on Target "C:\file.txt".
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [?] Help (default is "Y"):
```

The estimate of the risk is an attribute of the cmdlet or function known as its
**ConfirmImpact**. Users can't change it.

Cmdlets and functions that might pose a risk to the system have a **Confirm**
parameter that you can use to request or suppress confirmation for a single
command.

Because most cmdlets and functions use the default risk value,
**ConfirmImpact**, of **Medium**, and the default value of `$ConfirmPreference`
is **High**, automatic confirmation rarely occurs. However, you can activate
automatic confirmation by changing the value of `$ConfirmPreference` to
**Medium** or **Low**.

#### Examples

This example shows the effect of the `$ConfirmPreference` variable's default
value, **High**. The **High** value only confirms high-risk cmdlets and
functions. Since most cmdlets and functions are medium risk, they aren't
automatically confirmed and `Remove-Item` deletes the file. Adding `-Confirm`
to the command prompts the user for confirmation.

```powershell
$ConfirmPreference
```

```Output
High
```

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path C:\temp1.txt
```

Use `-Confirm` to request confirmation.

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path C:\temp2.txt -Confirm
```

```Output
Confirm
Are you sure you want to perform this action?
Performing operation "Remove File" on Target "C:\temp2.txt".
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All
[?] Help (default is "Y"):
```

The following example shows the effect of changing the value of
`$ConfirmPreference` to **Medium**. Because most cmdlets and function are
medium risk, they're automatically confirmed. To suppress the confirmation
prompt for a single command, use the **Confirm** parameter with a value of
`$false`.

```powershell
$ConfirmPreference = "Medium"
Remove-Item -Path C:\temp2.txt
```

```Output
Confirm
Are you sure you want to perform this action?
Performing operation "Remove File" on Target "C:\temp2.txt".
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All
[?] Help (default is "Y"):
```

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path C:\temp3.txt -Confirm:$false
```

### \$DebugPreference

Determines how PowerShell responds to debugging messages generated by a script,
cmdlet or provider, or by a `Write-Debug` command at the command line.

Some cmdlets display debugging messages, which are typically technical messages
designed for programmers and technical support professionals. By default,
debugging messages aren't displayed, but you can display debugging messages by
changing the value of `$DebugPreference`.

You can use the **Debug** common parameter of a cmdlet to display or hide the
debugging messages for a specific command. For more information, see
[about_CommonParameters](about_CommonParameters.md).

The valid values are as follows:

- **Stop**: Displays the debug message and stops executing. Writes an error to
  the console.
- **Inquire**: Displays the debug message and asks you whether you want to
  continue. Adding the **Debug** common parameter to a command, when the
  command is configured to generate a debugging message, changes the value of
  the `$DebugPreference` variable to **Inquire**.
- **Continue**: Displays the debug message and continues with execution.
- **SilentlyContinue**: (Default) No effect. The debug message isn't displayed
  and execution continues without interruption.

#### Examples

The following examples show the effect of changing the values of
`$DebugPreference` when a `Write-Debug` command is entered at the command line.
The change affects all debugging messages, including messages generated by
cmdlets and scripts. The examples show the **Debug** parameter, which displays
or hides the debugging messages related to a single command.

This example shows the effect of the `$DebugPreference` variable's default
value, **SilentlyContinue**. By default, the `Write-Debug` cmdlet's debug
message isn't displayed and processing continues. When the **Debug** parameter
is used, it overrides the preference for a single command. The debug message is
displayed.

```powershell
$DebugPreference
```

```Output
SilentlyContinue
```

```powershell
Write-Debug -Message "Hello, World"
```

```powershell
Write-Debug -Message "Hello, World" -Debug
```

```Output
DEBUG: Hello, World
```

This example shows the effect of `$DebugPreference` with the **Continue**
value. The debug message is displayed and the command continues to process.

```powershell
$DebugPreference = "Continue"
Write-Debug -Message "Hello, World"
```

```Output
DEBUG: Hello, World
```

This example uses the **Debug** parameter with a value of `$false` to suppress
the message for a single command. The debug message isn't displayed.

```powershell
Write-Debug -Message "Hello, World" -Debug:$false
```

This example shows the effect of `$DebugPreference` being set to the **Stop**
value. The debug message is displayed and the command is stopped.

```powershell
$DebugPreference = "Stop"
Write-Debug -Message "Hello, World"
```

```Output
DEBUG: Hello, World
Write-Debug : The running command stopped because the preference variable
 "DebugPreference" or common parameter is set to Stop: Hello, World
At line:1 char:1
+ Write-Debug -Message "Hello, World"
```

This example uses the **Debug** parameter with a value of `$false` to suppress
the message for a single command. The debug message isn't displayed and
processing isn't stopped.

```powershell
Write-Debug -Message "Hello, World" -Debug:$false
```

This example shows the effect of `$DebugPreference` being set to the
**Inquire** value. The debug message is displayed and the user is prompted for
confirmation.

```powershell
$DebugPreference = "Inquire"
Write-Debug -Message "Hello, World"
```

```Output
DEBUG: Hello, World

Confirm
Continue with this operation?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [H] Halt Command  [?] Help (default is "Y"):
```

This example uses the **Debug** parameter with a value of `$false` to suppress
the message for a single command. The debug message isn't displayed and
processing continues.

```powershell
Write-Debug -Message "Hello, World" -Debug:$false
```

### \$ErrorActionPreference

Determines how PowerShell responds to a non-terminating error, an error that
doesn't stop the cmdlet processing. For example, at the command line or in a
script, cmdlet, or provider, such as the errors generated by the `Write-Error`
cmdlet.

You can use a cmdlet's **ErrorAction** common parameter to override the
preference for a specific command.

The valid values are as follows:

- **Break** - Enter the debugger when an error occurs or when an exception is
  raised.
- **Continue**: (Default) Displays the error message and continues executing.
- **Ignore**: Suppresses the error message and continues to execute the
  command. The **Ignore** value is intended for per-command use, not for use as
  saved preference. **Ignore** isn't a valid value for the
  `$ErrorActionPreference` variable.
- **Inquire**: Displays the error message and asks you whether you want to
  continue.
- **SilentlyContinue**: No effect. The error message isn't displayed and
  execution continues without interruption.
- **Stop**: Displays the error message and stops executing. In addition to the
  error generated, the **Stop** value generates an ActionPreferenceStopException
  object to the error stream.
  stream
- **Suspend**: Automatically suspends a workflow job to allow for further
  investigation. After investigation, the workflow can be resumed. The
  **Suspend** value is intended for per-command use, not for use as saved
  preference. **Suspend** isn't a valid value for the `$ErrorActionPreference`
  variable.

`$ErrorActionPreference` and the **ErrorAction** parameter don't affect how
PowerShell responds to terminating errors that stop cmdlet processing. For more
information about the **ErrorAction** common parameter, see
[about_CommonParameters](about_CommonParameters.md).

#### Examples

These examples show the effect of the different values of the
`$ErrorActionPreference` variable. The **ErrorAction** parameter is used to
override the `$ErrorActionPreference` value.

This example shows the `$ErrorActionPreference` default value, **Continue**. A
non-terminating error is generated. The message is displayed and processing
continues.

```powershell
# Change the ErrorActionPreference to 'Continue'
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue'
# Generate a non-terminating error and continue processing the script.
Write-Error -Message  'Test Error' ; Write-Host 'Hello World'
```

```Output
Write-Error: Test Error
Hello World
```

This example shows the `$ErrorActionPreference` default value, **Inquire**. An
error is generated and a prompt for action is shown.

```powershell
# Change the ErrorActionPreference to 'Inquire'
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Inquire'
Write-Error -Message 'Test Error' ; Write-Host 'Hello World'
```

```Output
Confirm
Test Error
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [H] Halt Command  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"):
```

This example shows the `$ErrorActionPreference` set to **SilentlyContinue**.
The error message is suppressed.

```powershell
# Change the ErrorActionPreference to 'SilentlyContinue'
$ErrorActionPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
# Generate an error message
Write-Error -Message 'Test Error' ; Write-Host 'Hello World'
# Error message is suppressed and script continues processing
```

```Output
Hello World
```

This example shows the `$ErrorActionPreference` set to **Stop**. It also shows
the extra object generated to the `$Error` variable.

```powershell
# Change the ErrorActionPreference to 'Stop'
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'
# Error message is is generated and script stops processing
Write-Error -Message 'Test Error' ; Write-Host 'Hello World'

# Show the ActionPreferenceStopException and the error generated
$Error[0]
$Error[1]
```

```Output
Write-Error: Test Error

HResult                     : -2146233087

Write-Error: Test Error
```

### \$ErrorView

Determines the display format of error messages in PowerShell.

The valid values are as follows:

- **ConciseView**: (Default) Provides a concise error message and a refactored
  view for advanced module builders. If the error is from command line it's a
  single line error message. Otherwise, you receive a multiline error message
  that contains the error and a pointer to the error showing where it occurs in
  that line. If the terminal supports Virtual Terminal, then ANSI color codes
  are used to provide color accent. The Accent color can be changed at
  `$Host.PrivateData.ErrorAccentColor`. Use `Get-Error` cmdlet for a
  comprehensive detailed view of the fully qualified error, including inner
  exceptions.

  **ConciseView** was added in PowerShell 7.

- **NormalView**: A detailed view designed for most users. Consists of a
  description of the error and the name of the object involved in the error.

- **CategoryView**: A succinct, structured view designed for production
  environments. The format is as follows:

  {Category}: ({TargetName}:{TargetType}):[{Activity}], {Reason}

For more information about the fields in **CategoryView**, see
[ErrorCategoryInfo](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.errorcategoryinfo)
class.

#### Examples

This example shows how an error appears when the value of `$ErrorView` is the
default, **ConciseView**. `Get-ChildItem` is used to find a non-existent
directory.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -path 'C:\NoRealDirectory'
```

```Output
Get-ChildItem: Cannot find path 'C:\NoRealDirectory' because it does not exist.
```

This example shows how an error appears when the value of `$ErrorView` is the
default, **ConciseView**. `Script.ps1` is run and throws an error from
`Get-Item` statement.

```powershell
./Script.ps1
```

```Output
Get-Item: C:\Script.ps1
Line |
  11 | Get-Item -Path .\stuff
     | ^ Cannot find path 'C:\demo\stuff' because it does not exist.
```

This example shows how an error appears when the value of `$ErrorView` is
changed to **NormalView**. `Get-ChildItem` is used to find a non-existent file.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\nofile.txt
```

```Output
Get-ChildItem : Cannot find path 'C:\nofile.txt' because it does not exist.
At line:1 char:1
+ Get-ChildItem -Path C:\nofile.txt
```

This example shows how the same error appears when the value of `$ErrorView` is
changed to **CategoryView**.

```powershell
$ErrorView = "CategoryView"
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\nofile.txt
```

```Output
ObjectNotFound: (C:\nofile.txt:String) [Get-ChildItem], ItemNotFoundException
```

This example demonstrates that the value of `$ErrorView` only affects the error
display. It doesn't change the structure of the error object that is stored in
the `$Error` automatic variable. For information about the `$Error` automatic
variable, see [about_automatic_variables](about_Automatic_Variables.md).

The following command takes the **ErrorRecord** object associated with the most
recent error in the error array, **element 0**, and formats all the error
object's properties in a list.

```powershell
$Error[0] | Format-List -Property * -Force
```

```Output
PSMessageDetails      :
Exception             : System.Management.Automation.ItemNotFoundException:
                          Cannot find path 'C:\nofile.txt' because it does
                          not exist.

                          GetChildItems(String path, Boolean recurse, UInt32
                          depth, CmdletProviderContext context)
                        at System.Management.Automation.ChildItemCmdlet
                          ProviderIntrinsics.Get(String path, Boolean
                          recurse, UInt32 depth, CmdletProviderContext context)
                        at Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetChildItemCommand.

ScriptStackTrace      : at <ScriptBlock>, <No file>: line 1

```

### \$FormatEnumerationLimit

Determines how many enumerated items are included in a display. This variable
doesn't affect the underlying objects, only the display. When the value of
`$FormatEnumerationLimit` is fewer than the number of enumerated items,
PowerShell adds an ellipsis (`...`) to indicate items not shown.

**Valid values**: Integers (`Int32`)

**Default value**: 4

#### Examples

This example shows how to use the `$FormatEnumerationLimit` variable to improve
the display of enumerated items.

The command in this example generates a table that lists all the services
running on the computer in two groups: one for **running** services and one for
**stopped** services. It uses a `Get-Service` command to get all the services,
and then sends the results through the pipeline to the `Group-Object` cmdlet,
which groups the results by the service status.

The result is a table that lists the status in the **Name** column, and the
processes in the **Group** column. To change the column labels, use a hash
table, see [about_Hash_Tables](about_Hash_Tables.md). For more information, see
the examples in
[Format-Table](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.Format-Table).

Find the current value of `$FormatEnumerationLimit`.

```powershell
$FormatEnumerationLimit
```

```Output
4
```

List all services grouped by **Status**. There are a maximum of four services
listed in the **Group** column for each status because
`$FormatEnumerationLimit` has a value of **4**.

```powershell
Get-Service | Group-Object -Property Status
```

```Output
Count  Name       Group
-----  ----       -----
60     Running    {AdtAgent, ALG, Ati HotKey Poller, AudioSrv...}
41     Stopped    {Alerter, AppMgmt, aspnet_state, ATI Smart...}
```

To increase the number of items listed, increase the value of
`$FormatEnumerationLimit` to **1000**. Use `Get-Service` and `Group-Object` to
display the services.

```powershell
$FormatEnumerationLimit = 1000
Get-Service | Group-Object -Property Status
```

```Output
Count  Name       Group
-----  ----       -----
60     Running    {AdtAgent, ALG, Ati HotKey Poller, AudioSrv, BITS, CcmExec...
41     Stopped    {Alerter, AppMgmt, aspnet_state, ATI Smart, Browser, CiSvc...
```

Use `Format-Table` with the **Wrap** parameter to display the list of services.

```powershell
Get-Service | Group-Object -Property Status | Format-Table -Wrap
```

```Output
Count  Name       Group
-----  ----       -----
60     Running    {AdtAgent, ALG, Ati HotKey Poller, AudioSrv, BITS, CcmExec,
                  Client for NFS, CryptSvc, DcomLaunch, Dhcp, dmserver,

```

### \$InformationPreference

The `$InformationPreference` variable lets you set information stream
preferences that you want displayed to users. Specifically, informational
messages that you added to commands or scripts by adding the [Write-Information](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.Write-Information)
cmdlet. If the **InformationAction** parameter is used, its value overrides the
value of the `$InformationPreference` variable. `Write-Information` was
introduced in PowerShell 5.0.

The valid values are as follows:

- **Stop**: Stops a command or script at an occurrence of the
  `Write-Information` command.
- **Inquire**: Displays the informational message that you specify in a
  `Write-Information` command, then asks whether you want to continue.
- **Continue**: Displays the informational message, and continues running.
- **Suspend** is only available for workflows which aren't supported in
  PowerShell 6 and beyond.
- **SilentlyContinue**: (Default) No effect. The informational messages aren't
  displayed, and the script continues without interruption.

### \$Log*Event

The **Log*Event** preference variables determine which types of events are
written to the PowerShell event log in Event Viewer. By default, only engine
and provider events are logged. But, you can use the **Log*Event** preference
variables to customize your log, such as logging events about commands.

The **Log*Event** preference variables are as follows:

- `$LogCommandHealthEvent`: Logs errors and exceptions in command
  initialization and processing. The default is `$false` (not logged).
- `$LogCommandLifecycleEvent`: Logs the starting and stopping of commands and
  command pipelines and security exceptions in command discovery. The default
  is `$false` (not logged).
- `$LogEngineHealthEvent`: Logs errors and failures of sessions. The default is
  `$true` (logged).
- `$LogEngineLifecycleEvent`: Logs the opening and closing of sessions. The
  default is `$true` (logged).
- `$LogProviderHealthEvent`: Logs provider errors, such as read and write
  errors, lookup errors, and invocation errors. The default is `$true`
  (logged).
- `$LogProviderLifecycleEvent`: Logs adding and removing of PowerShell
  providers. The default is `$true` (logged). For information about PowerShell
  providers, see [about_Providers](about_Providers.md).

To enable a **Log*Event**, type the variable with a value of `$true`, for
example:

```powershell
$LogCommandLifeCycleEvent = $true
```

To disable an event type, type the variable with a value of `$false`, for
example:

```powershell
$LogCommandLifeCycleEvent = $false
```

The events that you enable are effective only for the current PowerShell
console. To apply the configuration to all consoles, save the variable settings
in your PowerShell profile. For more information, see
[about_Profiles](about_Profiles.md).

### \$MaximumHistoryCount

Determines how many commands are saved in the command history for the current
session.

**Valid values**: 1 - 32768 (`Int32`)

**Default**: 4096

To determine the number of commands current saved in the command history, type:

```powershell
(Get-History).Count
```

To see the commands saved in your session history, use the `Get-History`
cmdlet. For more information, see [about_History](about_History.md).

### \$OFS

The Output Field Separator (OFS) specifies the character that separates the
elements of an array that is converted to a string.

**Valid values**: Any string.

**Default**: Space

By default, the `$OFS` variable doesn't exist and the output file separator is
a space, but you can add this variable and set it to any string. You can change
the value of `$OFS` in your session, by typing `$OFS="<value>"`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're expecting the default value of a space (`" "`) in your script,
> module, or configuration output, be careful that the `$OFS` default value
> hasn't been changed elsewhere in your code.

#### Examples

This example shows that a space is used to separate the values when an array is
converted to a string. In this case, an array of integers is stored in a
variable and then the variable is cast as a string.

```powershell
$array = 1,2,3,4
[string]$array
```

```Output
1 2 3 4
```

To change the separator, add the `$OFS` variable by assigning a value to it.
The variable must be named `$OFS`.

```powershell
$OFS = "+"
[string]$array
```

```Output
1+2+3+4
```

To restore the default behavior, you can assign a space (`" "`) to the value of
`$OFS` or delete the variable. The following commands delete the variable and
then verify that the separator is a space.

```powershell
Remove-Variable OFS
[string]$array
```

```Output
1 2 3 4
```

### \$OutputEncoding

Determines the character encoding method that PowerShell uses when it sends
text to other applications.

For example, if an application returns Unicode strings to PowerShell, you might
need to change the value to **UnicodeEncoding** to send the characters
correctly.

The valid values are as follows: Objects derived from an Encoding class, such
as **ASCIIEncoding**, **SBCSCodePageEncoding**, **UTF7Encoding**,
**UTF8Encoding**, **UTF32Encoding**, and **UnicodeEncoding**.

**Default**: UTF8Encoding object (System.Text.UTF8Encoding)

#### Examples

This example shows how to make the Windows **findstr.exe** command work in
PowerShell on a computer that is localized for a language that uses Unicode
characters, such as Chinese.

The first command finds the value of `$OutputEncoding`. Because the value is an
encoding object, display only its **EncodingName** property.

```powershell
$OutputEncoding.EncodingName
```

In this example, a **findstr.exe** command is used to search for two Chinese
characters that are present in the `Test.txt` file. When this **findstr.exe**
command is run in the Windows Command Prompt (**cmd.exe**), **findstr.exe**
finds the characters in the text file. However, when you run the same
**findstr.exe** command in PowerShell, the characters aren't found because the
PowerShell sends them to **findstr.exe** in ASCII text, instead of in Unicode
text.

```powershell
findstr <Unicode-characters>
```

To make the command work in PowerShell, set the value of `$OutputEncoding` to
the value of the **OutputEncoding** property of the console, that is based on
the locale selected for Windows. Because **OutputEncoding** is a static
property of the console, use double-colons (`::`) in the command.

```powershell
$OutputEncoding = [console]::OutputEncoding
$OutputEncoding.EncodingName
```

```Output
OEM United States
```

After the encoding change, the **findstr.exe** command finds the Unicode
characters.

```powershell
findstr <Unicode-characters>
```

```Output
test.txt:         <Unicode-characters>
```

### \$ProgressPreference

Determines how PowerShell responds to progress updates generated by a script,
cmdlet, or provider, such as the progress bars generated by the
[Write-Progress](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.Write-Progress) cmdlet.
The `Write-Progress` cmdlet creates progress bars that show a command's status.

The valid values are as follows:

- **Stop**: Doesn't display the progress bar. Instead, it displays an error
  message and stops executing.
- **Inquire**: Doesn't display the progress bar. Prompts for permission to
  continue. If you reply with `Y` or `A`, it displays the progress bar.
- **Continue**: (Default) Displays the progress bar and continues with
  execution.
- **SilentlyContinue**: Executes the command, but doesn't display the progress
  bar.

### \$PSEmailServer

Specifies the default e-mail server that is used to send email messages. This
preference variable is used by cmdlets that send email, such as the
[Send-MailMessage](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.Send-MailMessage)
cmdlet.

### \$PSDefaultParameterValues

Specifies default values for the parameters of cmdlets and advanced functions.
The value of `$PSDefaultParameterValues` is a hash table where the key consists
of the cmdlet name and parameter name separated by a colon (`:`). The value is
a custom default value that you specify.

`$PSDefaultParameterValues` was introduced in PowerShell 3.0.

For more information about this preference variable, see
[about_Parameters_Default_Values](about_Parameters_Default_Values.md).

### \$PSModuleAutoloadingPreference

Enables and disables automatic importing of modules in the session. **All** is
the default. Regardless of the variable's value, you can use
[Import-Module](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Core.Import-Module) to import a module.

Valid values are:

- **All**: Modules are imported automatically on first-use. To import a module,
  get or use any command in the module. For example, use `Get-Command`.
- **ModuleQualified**: Modules are imported automatically only when a user uses
  the module-qualified name of a command in the module. For example, if the
  user types `MyModule\MyCommand`, PowerShell imports the **MyModule** module.
- **None**: Automatic importing of modules is disabled in the session. To
  import a module, use the `Import-Module` cmdlet.

For more information about automatic importing of modules, see
[about_Modules](about_Modules.md).

### \$PSSessionApplicationName

Specifies the default application name for a remote command that uses Web
Services for Management (WS-Management) technology. For more information, see
[About Windows Remote Management](/windows/win32/winrm/about-windows-remote-management).

The system default application name is `WSMAN`, but you can use this preference
variable to change the default.

The application name is the last node in a connection URI. For example, the
application name in the following sample URI is `WSMAN`.

`http://Server01:8080/WSMAN`

The default application name is used when the remote command doesn't specify a
connection URI or an application name.

The **WinRM** service uses the application name to select a listener to service
the connection request. The parameter's value should match the value of the
**URLPrefix** property of a listener on the remote computer.

To override the system default and the value of this variable, and select a
different application name for a particular session, use the **ConnectionURI**
or **ApplicationName** parameters of the [New-PSSession](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Core.New-PSSession),
[Enter-PSSession](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Core.Enter-PSSession), or
[Invoke-Command](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Core.Invoke-Command) cmdlets.

The `$PSSessionApplicationName` preference variable is set on the local
computer, but it specifies a listener on the remote computer. If the
application name that you specify doesn't exist on the remote computer, the
command to establish the session fails.

### \$PSSessionConfigurationName

Specifies the default session configuration that is used for **PSSessions**
created in the current session.

This preference variable is set on the local computer, but it specifies a
session configuration that's located on the remote computer.

The value of the `$PSSessionConfigurationName` variable is a fully qualified
resource URI.

The default value
`http://schemas.microsoft.com/PowerShell/microsoft.PowerShell` indicates the
**Microsoft.PowerShell** session configuration on the remote computer.

If you specify only a configuration name, the following schema URI is
prepended:

`http://schemas.microsoft.com/PowerShell/`

You can override the default and select a different session configuration for a
particular session by using the **ConfigurationName** parameter of the
`New-PSSession`, `Enter-PSSession`, or `Invoke-Command` cmdlets.

You can change the value of this variable at any time. When you do, remember
that the session configuration that you select must exist on the remote
computer. If it doesn't, the command to create a session that uses the session
configuration fails.

This preference variable doesn't determine which local session configurations
are used when remote users create a session that connects to this computer.
However, you can use the permissions for the local session configurations to
determine which users may use them.

### \$PSSessionOption

Establishes the default values for advanced user options in a remote session.
These option preferences override the system default values for session
options.

The `$PSSessionOption` variable contains a **PSSessionOption** object. For more
information, see
[System.Management.Automation.Remoting.PSSessionOption](/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.remoting.pssessionoption).
Each property of the object represents a session option. For example, the
**NoCompression** property turns of data compression during the session.

By default, the `$PSSessionOption` variable contains a **PSSessionOption**
object with the default values for all options, as shown below.

```Output
MaximumConnectionRedirectionCount : 5
NoCompression                     : False
NoMachineProfile                  : False
ProxyAccessType                   : None
ProxyAuthentication               : Negotiate
ProxyCredential                   :
SkipCACheck                       : False
SkipCNCheck                       : False
SkipRevocationCheck               : False
OperationTimeout                  : 00:03:00
NoEncryption                      : False
UseUTF16                          : False
IncludePortInSPN                  : False
OutputBufferingMode               : None
Culture                           :
UICulture                         :
MaximumReceivedDataSizePerCommand :
MaximumReceivedObjectSize         : 209715200
ApplicationArguments              :
OpenTimeout                       : 00:03:00
CancelTimeout                     : 00:01:00
IdleTimeout                       : -00:00:00.0010000
```

For descriptions of these options and more information, see
[New-PSSessionOption](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Core.New-PSSessionOption). For more information about
remote commands and sessions, see [about_Remote](about_Remote.md) and
[about_PSSessions](about_PSSessions.md).

To change the value of the `$PSSessionOption` preference variable, use the
`New-PSSessionOption` cmdlet to create a **PSSessionOption** object with the
option values you prefer. Save the output in a variable called
`$PSSessionOption`.

```powershell
$PSSessionOption = New-PSSessionOption -NoCompression
```

To use the `$PSSessionOption` preference variable in every PowerShell session,
add a `New-PSSessionOption` command that creates the `$PSSessionOption`
variable to your PowerShell profile. For more information, see
[about_Profiles](about_Profiles.md).

You can set custom options for a particular remote session. The options that
you set take precedence over the system defaults and the value of the
`$PSSessionOption` preference variable.

To set custom session options, use the `New-PSSessionOption` cmdlet to create a
**PSSessionOption** object. Then, use the **PSSessionOption** object as the
value of the **SessionOption** parameter in cmdlets that create a session, such
as `New-PSSession`, `Enter-PSSession`, and `Invoke-Command`.

### $Transcript

Used by `Start-Transcript` to specify the name and location of the transcript
file. If you do not specify a value for the **Path** parameter,
`Start-Transcript` uses the path in the value of the `$Transcript` global
variable. If you have not created this variable, `Start-Transcript` stores the
transcripts in the `$Home\My Documents` directory as
`\PowerShell_transcript.<time-stamp>.txt` files.

### \$VerbosePreference

Determines how PowerShell responds to verbose messages generated by a script,
cmdlet, or provider, such as the messages generated by the
[Write-Verbose](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.Write-Verbose) cmdlet.
Verbose messages describe the actions performed to execute a command.

By default, verbose messages aren't displayed, but you can change this behavior
by changing the value of `$VerbosePreference`.

You can use the **Verbose** common parameter of a cmdlet to display or hide the
verbose messages for a specific command. For more information, see
[about_CommonParameters](about_CommonParameters.md).

The valid values are as follows:

- **Stop**: Displays the verbose message and an error message and then stops
  executing.
- **Inquire**: Displays the verbose message and then displays a prompt that
  asks you whether you want to continue.
- **Continue**: Displays the verbose message and then continues with execution.
- **SilentlyContinue**: (Default) Doesn't display the verbose message. Continues
  executing.

#### Examples

These examples show the effect of the different values of `$VerbosePreference`
and the **Verbose** parameter to override the preference value.

This example shows the effect of the **SilentlyContinue** value, that is the
default. The command uses the **Message** parameter, but doesn't write a
message to the PowerShell console.

```powershell
Write-Verbose -Message "Verbose message test."
```

When the **Verbose** parameter is used, the message is written.

```powershell
Write-Verbose -Message "Verbose message test." -Verbose
```

```Output
VERBOSE: Verbose message test.
```

This example shows the effect of the **Continue** value. The
`$VerbosePreference` variable is set to **Continue** and the message is
displayed.

```powershell
$VerbosePreference = "Continue"
Write-Verbose -Message "Verbose message test."
```

```Output
VERBOSE: Verbose message test.
```

This example uses the **Verbose** parameter with a value of `$false` that
overrides the **Continue** value. The message isn't displayed.

```powershell
Write-Verbose -Message "Verbose message test." -Verbose:$false
```

This example shows the effect of the **Stop** value. The `$VerbosePreference`
variable is set to **Stop** and the message is displayed. The command is
stopped.

```powershell
$VerbosePreference = "Stop"
Write-Verbose -Message "Verbose message test."
```

```Output
VERBOSE: Verbose message test.
Write-Verbose : The running command stopped because the preference variable
  "VerbosePreference" or common parameter is set to Stop: Verbose message test.
At line:1 char:1
+ Write-Verbose -Message "Verbose message test."
```

This example uses the **Verbose** parameter with a value of `$false` that
overrides the **Stop** value. The message isn't displayed.

```powershell
Write-Verbose -Message "Verbose message test." -Verbose:$false
```

This example shows the effect of the **Inquire** value. The
`$VerbosePreference` variable is set to **Inquire**. The message is displayed
and the user is prompted for confirmation.

```powershell
$VerbosePreference = "Inquire"
Write-Verbose -Message "Verbose message test."
```

```Output
VERBOSE: Verbose message test.

Confirm
Continue with this operation?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [H] Halt Command  [?] Help (default is "Y"):
```

This example uses the **Verbose** parameter with a value of `$false` that
overrides the **Inquire** value. The user isn't prompted and the message isn't
displayed.

```powershell
Write-Verbose -Message "Verbose message test." -Verbose:$false
```

### \$WarningPreference

Determines how PowerShell responds to warning messages generated by a script,
cmdlet, or provider, such as the messages generated by the
[Write-Warning](xref:Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.Write-Warning) cmdlet.

By default, warning messages are displayed and execution continues, but you can
change this behavior by changing the value of `$WarningPreference`.

You can use the **WarningAction** common parameter of a cmdlet to determine how
PowerShell responds to warnings from a particular command. For more
information, see [about_CommonParameters](about_CommonParameters.md).

The valid values are as follows:

- **Stop**: Displays the warning message and an error message and then stops
  executing.
- **Inquire**: Displays the warning message and then prompts for permission to
  continue.
- **Continue**: (Default) Displays the warning message and then continues
  executing.
- **SilentlyContinue**: Doesn't display the warning message. Continues
  executing.

#### Examples

These examples show the effect of the different values of `$WarningPreference`.
The **WarningAction** parameter overrides the preference value.

This example shows the effect of the default value, **Continue**.

```powershell
$m = "This action can delete data."
Write-Warning -Message $m
```

```Output
WARNING: This action can delete data.
```

This example uses the **WarningAction** parameter with the value
**SilentlyContinue** to suppress the warning. The message isn't displayed.

```powershell
$m = "This action can delete data."
Write-Warning -Message $m -WarningAction SilentlyContinue
```

This example changes the `$WarningPreference` variable to the
**SilentlyContinue** value. The message isn't displayed.

```powershell
$WarningPreference = "SilentlyContinue"
$m = "This action can delete data."
Write-Warning -Message $m
```

This example uses the **WarningAction** parameter to stop when a warning is
generated.

```powershell
$m = "This action can delete data."
Write-Warning -Message $m -WarningAction Stop
```

```Output
WARNING: This action can delete data.
Write-Warning : The running command stopped because the preference variable
  "WarningPreference" or common parameter is set to Stop:
    This action can delete data.
At line:1 char:1
+ Write-Warning -Message $m -WarningAction Stop
```

This example changes the `$WarningPreference` variable to the **Inquire**
value. The user is prompted for confirmation.

```powershell
$WarningPreference = "Inquire"
$m = "This action can delete data."
Write-Warning -Message $m
```

```Output
WARNING: This action can delete data.

Confirm
Continue with this operation?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [H] Halt Command  [?] Help (default is "Y"):
```

This example uses the **WarningAction** parameter with the value
**SilentlyContinue**. The command continues to execute and no message is
displayed.

```powershell
$m = "This action can delete data."
Write-Warning -Message $m -WarningAction SilentlyContinue
```

This example changes the `$WarningPreference` value to **Stop**.

```powershell
$WarningPreference = "Stop"
$m = "This action can delete data."
Write-Warning -Message $m
```

```Output
WARNING: This action can delete data.
Write-Warning : The running command stopped because the preference variable
  "WarningPreference" or common parameter is set to Stop:
    This action can delete data.
At line:1 char:1
+ Write-Warning -Message $m
```

This example uses the **WarningAction** with the **Inquire** value. The user is
prompted when a warning occurs.

```powershell
$m = "This action can delete data."
Write-Warning -Message $m -WarningAction Inquire
```

```Output
WARNING: This action can delete data.

Confirm
Continue with this operation?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [H] Halt Command  [?] Help (default is "Y"):
```

### \$WhatIfPreference

Determines whether **WhatIf** is automatically enabled for every command that
supports it. When **WhatIf** is enabled, the cmdlet reports the expected effect
of the command, but doesn't execute the command.

The valid values are as follows:

- **False** (**0**, not enabled): (Default) **WhatIf** isn't automatically
  enabled. To enable it manually, use the cmdlet's **WhatIf** parameter.
- **True** (**1**, enabled): **WhatIf** is automatically enabled on any command
  that supports it. Users can use the **WhatIf** parameter with a value of
  **False** to disable it manually, such as `-WhatIf:$false`.

#### Examples

These examples show the effect of the different values of `$WhatIfPreference`.
They show how to use the **WhatIf** parameter to override the preference value
for a specific command.

This example shows the effect of the `$WhatIfPreference` variable set to the
default value, **False**. Use `Get-ChildItem` to verify that the file exists.
`Remove-Item` deletes the file. After the file is deleted, you can verify the
deletion with `Get-ChildItem`.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path .\test.txt
Remove-Item -Path ./test.txt
```

```Output
    Directory: C:\Test

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a---           9/13/2019    10:53             10 test.txt
```

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path .\test.txt
```

```Output
Get-ChildItem : Cannot find path 'C:\Test\test.txt' because it does not exist.
At line:1 char:1
+ Get-ChildItem -File test.txt
```

This example shows the effect of using the **WhatIf** parameter when the value
of `$WhatIfPreference` is **False**.

Verify that the file exists.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path .\test2.txt
```

```Output
    Directory: C:\Test

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a---           2/28/2019    17:06             12 test2.txt
```

Use the **WhatIf** parameter to determine the result of attempting to delete
the file.

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path .\test2.txt -WhatIf
```

```Output
What if: Performing the operation "Remove File" on target "C:\Test\test2.txt".
``````

Verify that the file wasn't deleted.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path .\test2.txt
```

```Output
    Directory: C:\Test

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a---           2/28/2019    17:06             12 test2.txt
```

This example shows the effect of the `$WhatIfPreference` variable set to the
value, **True**. When you use `Remove-Item` to delete a file, the file's path
is displayed, but the file isn't deleted.

Attempt to delete a file. A message is displayed about what would happen if
`Remove-Item` was run, but the file isn't deleted.

```powershell
$WhatIfPreference = "True"
Remove-Item -Path .\test2.txt
```

```Output
What if: Performing the operation "Remove File" on target "C:\Test\test2.txt".
```

Use `Get-ChildItem` to verify that the file wasn't deleted.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path .\test2.txt
```

```Output
    Directory: C:\Test

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a---           2/28/2019    17:06             12 test2.txt
```

This example shows how to delete a file when the value of `$WhatIfPreference`
is **True**. It uses the **WhatIf** parameter with a value of `$false`. Use
`Get-ChildItem` to verify the file was deleted.

```powershell
Remove-Item -Path .\test2.txt -WhatIf:$false
Get-ChildItem -Path .\test2.txt
```

```Output
Get-ChildItem : Cannot find path 'C:\Test\test2.txt' because it does not exist.
At line:1 char:1
+ Get-ChildItem -Path .\test2.txt
```

The following are examples of the `Get-Process` cmdlet that doesn't support
**WhatIf** and `Stop-Process` that does support **WhatIf**. The
`$WhatIfPreference` variable's value is **True**.

`Get-Process` doesn't support **WhatIf**. When the command is executed, it
displays the **Winword** process.

```powershell
Get-Process -Name Winword
```

```Output

`Stop-Process` does support **WhatIf**. The **Winword** process isn't stopped.

```powershell
Stop-Process -Name Winword
```

```Output
What if: Performing the operation "Stop-Process" on target "WINWORD (15024)".
```

You can override the `Stop-Process` **WhatIf** behavior by using the **WhatIf**
parameter with a value of `$false`. The **Winword** process is stopped.

```powershell
Stop-Process -Name Winword -WhatIf:$false
```

To verify that the **Winword** process was stopped, use `Get-Process`.

```powershell
Get-Process -Name Winword
```

```Output
Get-Process : Cannot find a process with the name "Winword".
  Verify the process name and call the cmdlet again.
At line:1 char:1
+ Get-Process -Name Winword
```
