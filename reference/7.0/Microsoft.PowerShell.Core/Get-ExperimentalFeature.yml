description: |-
  The `Get-ExperimentalFeature` cmdlet returns all experimental features discovered by PowerShell.
  Experimental features can come from modules or the PowerShell engine. Experimental features allow
  users to safely test new features and provide feedback (typically via GitHub) before the design is
  considered complete and any changes can become a breaking change.
