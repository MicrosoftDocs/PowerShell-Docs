# Enable-PSRemoting

## SYNOPSIS
Configures the computer to receive remote commands.

## SYNTAX

```
Enable-PSRemoting [-Force] [-SkipNetworkProfileCheck] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Enable-PSRemoting` cmdlet configures the computer to receive PowerShell remote commands that
are sent by using the WS-Management technology. WS-Management based PowerShell remoting is currently
supported only on Windows platform.

PowerShell remoting is enabled by default on Windows Server platforms. You can use
`Enable-PSRemoting` to enable PowerShell remoting on other supported versions of Windows and to
re-enable remoting if it becomes disabled.

You have to run this command only one time on each computer that will receive commands. You do not
have to run it on computers that only send commands. Because the configuration starts listeners to
accept remote connections, it is prudent to run it only where it is needed.

Enabling PowerShell remoting on client versions of Windows when the computer is on a public network
is normally disallowed, but you can skip this restriction by using the **SkipNetworkProfileCheck**
parameter. For more information, see the description of the **SkipNetworkProfileCheck** parameter.

Multiple PowerShell installations can exist side-by-side on a single computer. Running
`Enable-PSRemoting` will configure a remoting endpoint for the specific installation version that
you are running the cmdlet in. So if you run `Enable-PSRemoting` while running PowerShell 6.2, a
remoting endpoint will be configured that runs PowerShell 6.2. If you run `Enable-PSRemoting` while
running PowerShell 7-preview, a remoting endpoint will be configured that runs PowerShell 7-preview.

`Enable-PSRemoting` creates two remoting endpoint configurations as needed. If the endpoint
configurations already exist, then they are simply ensured to be enabled. The created configurations
are identical but have different names. One will have a simple name corresponding to the PowerShell
version that hosts the session. The other configuration name contains more detailed information
about the PowerShell version which hosts the session. For example, when running `Enable-PSRemoting`
in PowerShell 6.2, you will get two configured endpoints named **PowerShell.6**, **PowerShell.6.2.2**.
This allows you to create a connection to the latest PowerShell 6 host version by using the simple
name **PowerShell.6**. Or you can connect to a specific PowerShell host version by using the longer
name **PowerShell.6.2.2**.

To use the newly enabled remoting endpoints, you must specify them by name with the
**ConfigurationName** parameter when creating a remote connection using the
`Invoke-Command`,`New-PSSession`,`Enter-PSSession` cmdlets. For more information, see Example 4.

The `Enable-PSRemoting` cmdlet performs the following operations:

- Runs the [Set-WSManQuickConfig](../Microsoft.WSMan.Management/Set-WSManQuickConfig.md) cmdlet,
  which performs the following tasks:
  - Starts the WinRM service.
  - Sets the startup type on the WinRM service to Automatic.
  - Creates a listener to accept requests on any IP address.
  - Enables a firewall exception for WS-Management communications.
  - Creates the simple and long name session endpoint configurations if needed.
  - Enables all session configurations.
  - Changes the security descriptor of all session configurations to allow remote access.
- Restarts the WinRM service to make the preceding changes effective.

To run this cmdlet on the Windows platform, start PowerShell by using the Run as administrator
option. This cmdlet is not available on Linux or MacOS versions of PowerShell.

> [!CAUTION]
> This cmdlet does not affect remote endpoint configurations created by Windows PowerShell.
> It only affects endpoints created with PowerShell version 6 and greater. To enable and
> disable PowerShell remoting endpoints that are hosted by Windows PowerShell, run the
> `Enable-PSRemoting` cmdlet from within a Windows PowerShell session.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Configure a computer to receive remote commands

This command configures the computer to receive remote commands.

```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting
```

```Output
WARNING: PowerShell remoting has been enabled only for PowerShell Core configurations and does not
affect Windows PowerShell remoting configurations. Run this cmdlet in Windows PowerShell to affect
all PowerShell remoting configurations.
```

### Example 2: Configure a computer to receive remote commands without a confirmation prompt

This command configures the computer to receive remote commands.
The **Force** parameter suppresses the user prompts.

```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting -Force
```

```Output
WARNING: PowerShell remoting has been enabled only for PowerShell Core configurations and does not
affect Windows PowerShell remoting configurations. Run this cmdlet in Windows PowerShell to affect
all PowerShell remoting configurations.
```

### Example 3: Allow remote access on clients

This example shows how to allow remote access from public networks on client versions of the Windows
operating system. The name of the firewall rule can be different for different versions of Windows.
Use `Get-NetFirewallRule` to see a list of rules. Before enabling the firewall rule, view the
security settings in the rule to verify that the configuration is appropriate for your environment.

```powershell
Get-NetFirewallRule -Name 'WINRM*' | Select-Object Name
```

```Output
Name
----
WINRM-HTTP-In-TCP-NoScope
WINRM-HTTP-In-TCP
WINRM-HTTP-Compat-In-TCP-NoScope
WINRM-HTTP-Compat-In-TCP
```

```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting -SkipNetworkProfileCheck -Force
Set-NetFirewallRule -Name 'WINRM-HTTP-In-TCP' -RemoteAddress Any
```

By default, `Enable-PSRemoting` creates network rules that allow remote access from private and
domain networks. The command uses the **SkipNetworkProfileCheck** parameter to allow remote access
from public networks in the same local subnet. The command specifies the **Force** parameter to
suppress confirmation messages.

The **SkipNetworkProfileCheck** parameter does not affect server versions of the Windows operating
system, which allow remote access from public networks in the same local subnet by default.

The `Set-NetFirewallRule` cmdlet in the **NetSecurity** module adds a firewall rule that allows
remote access from public networks from any remote location. This includes locations in different
subnets.

### Example 4: Create a remote session to the newly enabled endpoint configuration

This example shows how to enable PowerShell remoting on a computer, find the configured endpoint
names, and create a remote session to one of the endpoints.

The first command enables PowerShell remoting on the computer.

The second command lists the endpoint configurations.

The third command creates a remote PowerShell session to the same machine, specifying the
**PowerShell.6** endpoint by name. The remote session will be hosted with the latest PowerShell 6
version (6.2.2).

The last command accesses the `$PSVersionTable` variable in the remote session to display the
PowerShell version that is hosting the session.

```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting -Force

Get-PSSessionConfiguration

$session = New-PSSession -ComputerName localhost -ConfigurationName PowerShell.6

Invoke-Command -Session $session -ScriptBlock { $PSVersionTable }
```

```Output
WARNING: PowerShell remoting has been enabled only for PowerShell Core configurations and does not
affect Windows PowerShell remoting configurations. Run this cmdlet in Windows PowerShell to affect
all PowerShell remoting configurations.

## PARAMETERS

### -Confirm

Prompts you for confirmation before running the cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force

Forces the command to run without asking for user confirmation.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SkipNetworkProfileCheck

Indicates that this cmdlet enables remoting on client versions of the Windows operating system when
the computer is on a public network. This parameter enables a firewall rule for public networks that
allows remote access only from computers in the same local subnet.

This parameter does not affect server versions of the Windows operating system, which, by default,
have a local subnet firewall rule for public networks. If the local subnet firewall rule is disabled
on a server version, `Enable-PSRemoting` re-enables it, regardless of the value of this parameter.

To remove the local subnet restriction and enable remote access from all locations on public
networks, use the `Set-NetFirewallRule` cmdlet in the **NetSecurity** module.

This parameter was introduced in PowerShell 3.0.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs.
The cmdlet is not run.

```yaml
Type: System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: False
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters: -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable,
-InformationAction, -InformationVariable, -OutVariable, -OutBuffer, -PipelineVariable, -Verbose,
-WarningAction, and -WarningVariable. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### None

You cannot pipe input to this cmdlet.

## OUTPUTS

### System.String

This cmdlet returns strings that describe its results.

## NOTES

This cmdlet is only available on Windows platforms.

On server versions of the Windows operating system, `Enable-PSRemoting` creates firewall rules for
private and domain networks that allow remote access, and creates a firewall rule for public
networks that allows remote access only from computers in the same local subnet.

On client versions of the Windows operating system, `Enable-PSRemoting` creates firewall rules for
private and domain networks that allow unrestricted remote access. To create a firewall rule for
public networks that allows remote access from the same local subnet, use the
**SkipNetworkProfileCheck** parameter.

On client or server versions of the Windows operating system, to create a firewall rule for public
networks that removes the local subnet restriction and allows remote access , use the
`Set-NetFirewallRule` cmdlet in the NetSecurity module to run the following command:
`Set-NetFirewallRule -Name "WINRM-HTTP-In-TCP-PUBLIC" -RemoteAddress Any`

`Enable-PSRemoting` enables all session configurations by setting the value of the **Enabled**
property of all session configurations to `$True`.

`Enable-PSRemoting` removes the **Deny_All** and **Network_Deny_All** settings. This provides remote
access to session configurations that were reserved for local use.
