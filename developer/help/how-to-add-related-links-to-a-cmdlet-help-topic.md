# How to Add Related Links to a Cmdlet Help Topic

This section describes how to add references to other content that is related to a Windows PowerShell® cmdlet Help topic. Because these references appear in a command window, they do not link directly to the referenced content.

In the cmdlet Help topics that are included in Windows PowerShell®, these links reference other cmdlets, conceptual content ("about_"), and other documents and Help files that are not related to Windows PowerShell®.

The following XML shows how to add a RelatedLinks node that contains two references to related topics.

```xml
<maml:relatedLinks>
  <maml:navigationLink>
    <maml:linkText>Topic-name</maml:linkText>
  </maml:navigationLink>
  <maml:navigationLink>
    <maml:linkText>Topic-name</maml:linkText>
  </maml:navigationLink>
</ maml:relatedLinks >
```
