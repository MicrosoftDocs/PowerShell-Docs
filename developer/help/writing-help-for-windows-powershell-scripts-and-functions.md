# Writing Help for PowerShell Scripts and Functions

PowerShell scripts and functions should be fully documented whenever they are shared with others.
The `Get-Help` cmdlet displays the script and function help topics in the same format as it displays help for cmdlets, and all of the `Get-Help` parameters work on script and function help topics.

PowerShell scripts can include a help topic about the script and help topics about each functions in the script.
Functions that are shared independently of scripts can include their own help topics.

This document explains the format and correct placement of the help topics, and it suggests guidelines for the content.

## Types of Script and Function Help

### Comment-Based Help
The help topic that describes a script or function can be implemented as a set of comments within the script or function.
When writing comment-based help for a script and for functions in a script, pay careful attention to the rules for placing the comment-based help.
The placement determines whether the `Get-Help` cmdlet associates the help topic with the script or a function.
For more information about writing comment-based help topics, see [about_Comment_Based_Help](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_comment_based_help).

### XML-Based Command Help
The help topic that describes a script or function can be implemented in an XML file that uses the command help schema.
To associate the script or function with the XML file, use the `ExternalHelp` comment keyword followed by the path and name of the XML file.

When the `ExternalHelp` comment keyword is present, it takes precedence over comment-based help, even when `Get-Help` cannot find a help file that matches the value of the `ExternalHelp` keyword.

### Online Help
You can post your help topics on the Internet and then direct `Get-Help` to open the topics.
For more information about writing comment-based help topics, see [Supporting Online Help](../module/supporting-online-help.md).

There is no established method for writing conceptual ("About") topics for scripts and functions.
However, you can post conceptual topics on the Internet list the topics and their URLs in the Related Links section of a command help topic.

## Content Considerations for Script and Function Help

- If you are writing a very brief help topic with only a few of the available command help sections, be sure to include clear descriptions of the script or function parameters. Also include one or two sample commands in the examples section, even if you decide to omit example descriptions.

- In all descriptions, refer to the command as a script or function. This information helps the user to understand and manage the command.

  For example, the following detailed description states that the New-Topic command is a script. This reminds users that they need to specify the path and full name when they run it.

  > "The New-Topic script creates a blank conceptual topic for each topic name in the input file..."

  The following detailed description states that `Disable-PSRemoting` is a function. This information is particularly useful to users when the session includes multiple commands with the same name, some of which might be hidden by a command with higher precedence.

  > The `Disable-PSRemoting` function disables all session configurations on the local computer...

- In a script help topic, explain how to use the script as a whole. If you are also writing help topics for functions in the script, mention the functions in your script help topic and include references to the function help topics in the Related Links section of the script help topic. Conversely, when a function is part of a script, explain in the function help topic the role that the function plays in the script and how it might be used independently. Then list the script help topic in the Related Links section of the function help topic.

- When writing examples for a script help topic, be sure to include the path to the script file in the example command. This reminds users that they must specify the path explicitly, even when the script is in the current directory.

- In a function help topic, remind users that the function exists only in the current session and, to use it in other sessions, they need to add it, or add it a PowerShell profile.

- `Get-Help` displays the help topic for a script or function only when the script file and help topic files are saved in the correct locations. Therefore, it is not useful to include instructions for installing PowerShell, or saving or installing the script or function in a script or function help topic. Instead, include any installation instructions in the document that you use to distribute the script or function.
