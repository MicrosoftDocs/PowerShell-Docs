# Host01 Sample

This sample shows how to implement a host application that uses a custom host. In this sample a runspace is created that uses the custom host, and then the [System.Management.Automation.Powershell](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.PowerShell) API is used to run a script that calls "exit." The host application then looks at the output of the script and prints out the results.

 This sample uses the default UI features provided by Windows PowerShell. For more information about implementing the UI features of a custom host, see [Host02 Sample](./host02-sample.md).

## Requirements

 This sample requires Windows PowerShell 2.0.

## Demonstrates

- Creating a custom host class that derives from the [System.Management.Automation.Host.Pshost](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.Host.PSHost) class.

- Creating a runspace that uses the custom host class.

- Creating a [System.Management.Automation.Powershell](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.PowerShell) object that runs a script that calls exit.

- Verifying that the correct exit code was used in the exit process.

## Example

 The following code shows an implementation of a host application that uses a simple custom host interface.

```csharp
namespace Microsoft.Samples.PowerShell.Host
{

    using System;
    using System.Management.Automation;
    using System.Management.Automation.Runspaces;
    using PowerShell = System.Management.Automation.PowerShell;

    /// <summary>
    /// This class contains the Main entry point for this host application.
    /// </summary>
    internal class Host01
    {

        /// <summary>
        /// Indicator to tell the host application that it should exit.
        /// </summary>
        private bool shouldExit;

        /// <summary>
        /// The exit code that the host application will use to exit.
        /// </summary>
        private int exitCode;

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets or sets a value indicating whether the
        /// host application should exit.
        /// </summary>
        public bool ShouldExit
        {
            get { return this.shouldExit; }
            set { this.shouldExit = value; }
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Gets or sets the PSHost implementation that is
        /// used to tell the host application what code to use
        /// when exiting.
        /// </summary>
        public int ExitCode
        {
            get { return this.exitCode; }
            set { this.exitCode = value; }
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// This sample uses a PowerShell object to run
        /// a script that calls exit. The host application looks at
        /// this and prints out the result.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="args">Parameter not used.</param>
        private static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Create an instance of this host application class so that
            // the Windows PowerShell engine will have access to the
            // ShouldExit and ExitCode parameters.
            Host01 me = new Host01();

            // Create the host instance to use.
            MyHost myHost = new MyHost(me);

            // Create a runspace that uses the host object and run the
            // script using a PowerShell object.
            using (Runspace myRunSpace = RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace(myHost))
            {
                // Open the runspace.
                myRunSpace.Open();

                // Create a PowerShell object to run the script.
                using (PowerShell powershell = PowerShell.Create())
                {
                    powershell.Runspace = myRunSpace;

                    // Create the pipeline and run the script
                    // "exit (2+2)".
                    string script = "exit (2+2)";
                    powershell.AddScript(script);
                    powershell.Invoke(script);
                }

                // Check the flags and see if they were set propertly.
                Console.WriteLine(
                    "ShouldExit={0} (should be True); ExitCode={1} (should be 4)",
                    me.ShouldExit,
                    me.ExitCode);

                // close the runspace to free resources.
                myRunSpace.Close();
            }

            Console.WriteLine("Hit any key to exit...");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

## Example

 The following code is the implementation of the [System.Management.Automation.Host.Pshost](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.Host.PSHost) class that is used by this host application. Those elements that are not implemented throw an exception or return nothing.

```csharp

    /// console applications. Not all members are implemented. Those that
    /// are not implemented throw a NotImplementedException exception or
    /// return nothing.
    /// </summary>
    internal class MyHost : PSHost
    {
        /// <summary>
