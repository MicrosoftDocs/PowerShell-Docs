# RunSpace03 (C#) Code Sample

Here is the C# source code for the console application described in [Creating a Console Application That Runs a Specified Script](fd). This sample uses the [System.Management.Automation.Runspaceinvoke](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.RunspaceInvoke) class to execute a script that retrieves process information by using the list of process names passed into the script. It shows how to pass input objects to a script and how to retrieve error objects as well as the output objects.
