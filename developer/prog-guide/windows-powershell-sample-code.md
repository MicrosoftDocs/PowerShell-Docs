# Windows PowerShell Sample Code

Windows PowerShellÂ® samples are available through the Windows SDK. This section contains the sample code that is contained in the Windows SDK samples.

> [!NOTE]
> When the Windows SDK is installed, a **Samples** directory is created in which all the Windows PowerShell samples are made available. A typical installation directory is **C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0**. Start Windows PowerShell and type **"cd Samples\SysMgmt\PowerShell"**  to locate the Windows PowerShell Samples directory. In this document, the Windows PowerShell Samples directory is referred to as **\<PowerShell Samples>**.
