# Windows PowerShell Programmer&#39;s Guide

This programmer's guide is targeted at developers who are interested in providing a command-line management environment for system administrators. Windows PowerShell provides a simple way for you to build management commands that expose .NET objects, while allowing Windows PowerShell to do most of the work for you.

In traditional command development, you are required to write a parameter parser, a parameter binder, filters, and all other functionality exposed by each command. Windows PowerShell provides the following to make it easy for you to write commands:

- A powerful Windows PowerShell runtime (execution engine) with its own parser and a mechanism for automatically binding command parameters.

- Utilities for formatting and displaying command results using a command line interpreter (CLI).

- Support for high levels of functionality  (through Windows PowerShell providers) that make it easy to access stored data.

  At little cost, you can represent a .NET object by a rich command or set of commands that will offer a complete command-line experience to the administrator.

  The next section covers the key Windows PowerShell concepts and terms. Familiarize yourself with these concepts and terms before starting development.

## About Windows PowerShell

Windows PowerShell defines several types of commands that you can use in development. These commands include: functions, filters, scripts, aliases, and executables (applications). The main command type discussed in this guide is a simple, small command called a "cmdlet". Windows PowerShell furnishes a set of cmdlets and fully supports cmdlet customization to suit your environment. The Windows PowerShell runtime processes all command types just as it does cmdlets, using pipelines.

In addition to commands, Windows PowerShell supports various customizable Windows PowerShell providers that make available specific sets of cmdlets. The shell operates within the Windows PowerShell-provided host application (Windows PowerShell.exe), but it is equally accessible from a custom host application that you can develop to meet specific requirements. For more information, see [How Windows PowerShell Works](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ced30e23-10af-4700-8933-49873bd84d58).

### Windows PowerShell Cmdlets

A cmdlet is a lightweight command that is used in the Windows PowerShell environment. The Windows PowerShell runtime invokes these cmdlets within the context of automation scripts that are provided at the command line, and the Windows PowerShell runtime also invokes them programmatically through Windows PowerShell APIs.

For more information about cmdlets, see [Writing a Windows PowerShell Cmdlet](../cmdlet/writing-a-windows-powershell-cmdlet.md).

### Windows PowerShell Providers

In performing administrative tasks, the user may need to examine data stored in a data store (for example, the file system, the Windows Registry, or a certificate store). To make these operations easier, Windows PowerShell defines a module called a Windows PowerShell provider that can be used to access a specific data store, such as the Windows Registry. Each provider supports a set of related cmdlets to give the user a symmetrical view of the data in the store.

Windows PowerShell provides several default Windows PowerShell providers. For example, the Registry provider supports navigation and manipulation of the Windows Registry. Registry keys are represented as items, and registry values are treated as properties.

If you expose a data store that the user will need to access, you might need to write your own Windows PowerShell provider, as described in [Creating Windows PowerShell Providers](./how-to-create-a-windows-powershell-provider.md). For more information aboutWindows PowerShell providers, see [How Windows PowerShell Works](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ced30e23-10af-4700-8933-49873bd84d58).

### Host Application

Windows PowerShell includes the default host application powershell.exe, which is a console application that interacts with the user and hosts the Windows PowerShell runtime using a console window.

Only rarely will you need to write your own host application for Windows PowerShell, although customization is supported. One case in which you might need your own application is when you have a requirement for a GUI interface that is richer than the interface provided by the default host application. You might also want a custom application when you are basing your GUI on the command line. For more information, see[How to Create a Windows PowerShell Host Application](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d31355c9-a270-4b09-8f0c-35a7392a7d07).

### Windows PowerShell Runtime

The Windows PowerShell runtime is the execution engine that implements command processing. It includes the classes that provide the interface between the host application and Windows PowerShell commands and providers. The Windows PowerShell runtime is implemented as a runspace object for the current Windows PowerShell session, which is the operational environment in which the shell and the commands execute. For operational details, see [How Windows PowerShell Works](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ced30e23-10af-4700-8933-49873bd84d58).

### Windows PowerShell Language

The Windows PowerShell language provides scripting functions and mechanisms to invoke commands. For complete scripting information, see the Windows PowerShell Language Reference shipped with Windows PowerShell.

### Extended Type System (ETS)

Windows PowerShell provides access to a variety of different objects, such as .NET and XML objects. As a consequence, to present a common abstraction for all object types the shell uses its extended type system (ETS). Most ETS functionality is transparent to the user, but the script or .NET developer uses it for the following purposes:

- Viewing a subset of the members of specific objects. Windows PowerShell provides an "adapted" view of several specific object types.

- Adding members to existing objects.

- Access to serialized objects.

- Writing customized objects.

  Using ETS, you can create flexible new "types" that are compatible with the Windows PowerShell language. If you are a .NET developer, you are able to work with objects using the same semantics as the Windows PowerShell language applies to scripting, for example, to determine if an object evaluates to `true`.

  For more information about ETS and how Windows PowerShell uses objects, see [Windows PowerShell Object Concepts](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/12700631-be23-4e6b-9bf0-81ea0d166353).

## Programming for Windows PowerShell

Windows PowerShell defines its code for commands, providers, and other program modules using the .NET Framework. You are not confined to the use of Microsoft Visual Studio in creating customized modules for Windows PowerShell, although the samples provided in this guide are known to run in this tool. You can use any .NET language that supports class inheritance and the use of attributes. In some cases, Windows PowerShell APIs require the programming language to be able to access generic types.

## Programmer's Reference

For reference when developing for Windows PowerShell, see the [Windows PowerShell SDK](../windows-powershell-reference.md).

## Getting Started Using Windows PowerShell

For more information about starting to use the Windows PowerShell shell, see the [Getting Started with Windows PowerShell](/powershell/scripting/getting-started/getting-started-with-windows-powershell) shipped with Windows PowerShell. A Quick Reference tri-fold document is also supplied as a primer for cmdlet use.
