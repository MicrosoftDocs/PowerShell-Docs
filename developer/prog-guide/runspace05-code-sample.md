# RunSpace05 Code Sample

Here is the source code for the Runspace05 sample that is described in [Configuring a Runspace Using RunspaceConfiguration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/42681d19-2d05-4975-befd-afb1990e79b2). This sample shows how to create the runspace configuration information, create a runspace, create a pipeline with a single command, and then execute the pipeline. The command that is executed is the `Get-Process` cmdlet.
