# Naming Help Files

This topic explains how to name an XML-based help file so that the [Get-Help](/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/Get-Help) cmdlet can find it. The name requirements differ for each command type.

## Cmdlet Help Files

The help file for a C# cmdlet must be named for the assembly in which the cmdlet is defined. Use the following file name format:

```
<AssemblyName>.dll-help.xml
```

The assembly name format is required even when the assembly is a nested module.

For example, the [Get-WinEvent;PSITPro5_Diagnostic;](/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Diagnostics/Get-WinEvent) cmdlet is defined in the Microsoft.PowerShell.Diagnostics.dll assembly. The `Get-Help` cmdlet looks for a help topic for the `Get-WinEvent` cmdlet only in the Microsoft.PowerShell.Diagnostics.dll-help.xml file in the module directory.

## Provider Help files

The help file for a Windows PowerShell provider must be named for the assembly in which the provider is defined. Use the following file name format:

```
<AssemblyName>.dll-help.xml
```

The assembly name format is required even when the assembly is a nested module.

For example, the Certificate provider is defined in the Microsoft.PowerShell.Security.dll assembly. The `Get-Help` cmdlet looks for a help topic for the Certificate provider only in the Microsoft.PowerShell.Security.dll-help.xml file in the module directory.

## Function Help Files

Functions can be documented by using [comment-based help](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_comment_based_help) or documented in an XML help file. When the function is documented in an XML file, the function must have an `.ExternalHelp` comment keyword that associates the function with the XML file. Otherwise, the `Get-Help` cmdlet cannot find the help file.

There are no technical requirements for the name of a function help file. However, a best practice is to name the help file for the script module in which the function is defined. For example, the following function is defined in the MyModule.psm1 file.

```csharp
#.ExternalHelp MyModule.psm1-help.xml
function Test-Function { ... }
```

## CIM Command Help Files

The help file for a CIM command must be named for the CDXML file in which the CIM command is defined. Use the following file name format:

```
<FileName>.cdxml-help.xml
```

CIM commands are defined in CDXML files that can be included in modules as nested modules. When the CIM command is imported into the session as a function, Windows PowerShell adds an `.ExternalHelp` comment keyword to the function definition that associates the function with an XML help file that is named for the CDXML file in which the CIM command is defined.

## Script Workflow Help Files

Script workflows that are included in modules can be documented in XML-based help files. There are no technical requirements for the name of the help file. However, a best practice is to name the help file for the script module in which the script workflow is defined. For example:

```
<ScriptModule>.psm1-help.xml
```

Unlike other scripted commands, script workflows do not require an `.ExternalHelp` comment keyword to associate them with a help file. Instead, Windows PowerShell searches the UI-Culture-specific subdirectories of the module directory for XML-based help files and looks for help for the script workflow in all the files. `.ExternalHelp` comment keyword are ignored.

Because the `.ExternalHelp` comment keyword is ignored, the `Get-Help` cmdlet can find help for script workflows only when they are included in modules.
