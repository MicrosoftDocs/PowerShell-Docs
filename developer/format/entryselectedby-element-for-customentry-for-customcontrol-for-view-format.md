Selection conditions are used to define a condition that must exist for the entry to be used, such as when an object has a specific property or when a specific property value or script evaluates to `true`. For more information about selection conditions, see [Defining Conditions for when a View Entry or Item is Used](./defining-conditions-for-displaying-data.md).
