Selection conditions are used to define a condition that must exist for the definition to be used, such as when an object has a specific property or that a specific property value or script value evaluates to `true`. For more information about selection conditions, see [Defining Conditions for Displaying Data](./defining-conditions-for-displaying-data.md).
