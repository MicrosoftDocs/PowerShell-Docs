# EntrySelectedBy Element for ListEntry for ListControl (Format)

Defines the .NET types that use this list view definition or the condition that must exist for this definition to be used. In most cases only one definition is needed for a list view. However, you can provide multiple definitions for the list view if you want to use the same list view to display different data for different objects.

## Remarks

You must specify at least one type, selection set, or selection condition for a list view definition. There is no maximum limit to the number of child elements that you can use.

Selection conditions are used to define a condition that must exist for the definition to be used, such as when an object has a specific property or that a specific property value or script evaluates to `true`. For more information about selection conditions, see [Defining Conditions for when Data is displayed](./defining-conditions-for-displaying-data.md).

For more information about the components of a list view, see [Creating a List View](./creating-a-list-view.md).

## Example

The following example shows how to define the objects for a list view using their .NET type name.

```xml
<ListEntry>
  <EntrySelectedBy>
    <TypeName>NameofDotNetType</TypeName>>
  </EntrySelectedBy>
</ListEntry>
```
