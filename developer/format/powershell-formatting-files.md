# Windows PowerShell Formatting Files

Windows PowerShell provides several formatting files (.format.ps1xml) that are located in the installation directory (`$pshome`). Each of these files defines the default display for a specific set of .NET objects. These files should never be changed. However, you can use them as a reference for creating your own custom formatting files.

Certificate.Format.ps1xml

DotNetTypes.Format.ps1xml
