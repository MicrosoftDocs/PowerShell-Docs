# Cmdlet Error Reporting

Cmdlets should report errors differently depending on whether the errors are terminating errors or nonterminating errors. Terminating errors are errors that cause the pipeline to be terminated immediately, or errors that occur when there is no reason to continue processing. Nonterminating errors are those errors that report a current error condition, but the cmdlet can continue to process input objects. With nonterminating errors, the user is typically notified of the problem, but the cmdlet continues to process the next input object.

## Terminating and Nonterminating Errors

The following guidelines can be used to determine if an error condition is a terminating error or a nonterminating error.

- Does the error condition prevent your cmdlet from successfully processing any further input objects? If so, this is a terminating error.

- Is the error condition related to a specific input object or a subset of input objects? If so, this is a nonterminating error.

- Does the cmdlet accept multiple input objects, such that processing may succeed on another input object? If so, this is a nonterminating error.

- Cmdlets that can accept multiple input objects should decide between what are terminating and nonterminating errors, even when a particular situation applies to only a single input object.

- Cmdlets can receive any number of input objects and send any number of success or error objects before throwing a terminating exception. There is no relationship between the number of input objects received and the number of success and error objects sent.

- Cmdlets that can accept only 0-1 input objects and generate only 0-1 output objects should treat errors as terminating errors and generate terminating exceptions.

## Reporting Nonterminating Errors

The reporting of a nonterminating error should always be done within the cmdlet's implementation of the [System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.Beginprocessing*](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.BeginProcessing) method, the [System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.Processrecord*](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.ProcessRecord) method, or the [System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.Endprocessing*](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.EndProcessing) method. These types of errors are reported by calling the [System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.Writeerror*](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.WriteError) method that in turn sends an error record to the error stream.

## Reporting Terminating Errors

Terminating errors are reported by throwing exceptions or by calling the [System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.Throwterminatingerror*](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError) method. Be aware that cmdlets can also catch and re-throw exceptions such as OutOfMemory, however, they are not required to re-throw exceptions as the Windows PowerShell runtime will catch them as well.

You can also define your own exceptions for issues specific to your situation, or add additional information to an existing exception using its error record.

## Error Records

Windows PowerShell describes a nonterminating error condition through the use of [System.Management.Automation.Errorrecord](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.ErrorRecord) objects. Each [System.Management.Automation.Errorrecord](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.ErrorRecord) object provides error category information, an optional target object, and details about the error condition.

### Error Identifiers

The error identifier is a simple string that identifies the error condition within the cmdlet. Windows PowerShell combines this identifier with a cmdlet identifier to create a fully qualified error identifier that can be used later when filtering error streams or logging errors, when responding to specific errors, or with other user-specific activities.

The following guidelines should be followed when specifying error identifiers.

- Assign different, highly specific, error identifiers to different code paths. Each code path that calls [System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.Writeerror*](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.WriteError) or [System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.Throwterminatingerror*](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.Cmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError) should have its own error identifier.

- Error identifiers should be unique to CLR exception types for both terminating and nonterminating errors.

- Do not change the semantics of an error identifier between versions of your cmdlet or Windows PowerShell provider. After the semantics of an error identifier is established, it should remain constant throughout the life cycle of your cmdlet.

- For terminating errors, use a unique error identifier for a particular CLR exception type. If the exception type changes, use a new error identifier.

- For nonterminating errors, use a specific error identifier for a specific input object.

- Choose text for the identifier that tersely corresponds to the error being reported. Do not use white space or punctuation.

- Do not generate error identifiers that are not reproducible. For example, do not generate identifiers that include a process identifier. Error identifiers are useful only when they correspond to identifiers that are seen by other users who are experiencing the same problem.

### Error Categories

Error categories are used to group errors for the end-user. Windows PowerShell defines these categories and cmdlets and Windows PowerShell providers must choose between them when generating the error record.

For a description of the error categories that are available, see the [System.Management.Automation.Errorcategory](/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.ErrorCategory) enumeration. In general, you should avoid using NoError, UndefinedError, and GenericError whenever possible.

Users can view errors based on category when they set "`$ErrorView`" to "CategoryView".
