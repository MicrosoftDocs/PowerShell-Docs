# StopProc Tutorial

This section provides a tutorial for creating the Stop-Proc cmdlet, which is very similar to the [Stop-Process](/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Stop-Process) cmdlet provided by Windows PowerShell. This tutorial provides fragments of code that illustrate how cmdlets are implemented, and an explanation of the code.
