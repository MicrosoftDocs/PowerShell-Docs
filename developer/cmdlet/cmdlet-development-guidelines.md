# Cmdlet Development Guidelines

The topics in this section provide development guidelines that you can use to produce well-formed cmdlets. By leveraging the common functionality provided by the Windows PowerShell runtime and by following these guidelines, you can develop robust cmdlets with minimal effort and provide the user with a consistent experience. Additionally, you will reduce the test burden because common functionality does not require retesting.
