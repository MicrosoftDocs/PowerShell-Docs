# Approved Verbs for Windows PowerShell Commands

Windows PowerShell uses a verb-noun pair for the names of cmdlets and for their derived Microsoft .NET Framework classes. For example, the `Get-Command` cmdlet provided by Windows PowerShell is used to retrieve all the commands that are registered in Windows PowerShell. The verb part of the name identifies the action that the cmdlet performs. The noun part of the name identifies the entity on which the action is performed.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows PowerShell uses the term *verb* to describe a word that implies an action even if that word is not a standard verb in the English language. For example, the term *New* is a valid Windows PowerShell verb name because it implies an action even though it is not a verb in the English language.

## Verb Naming Rules

The following list provides guidelines to consider when you choose the verb for a cmdlet name:

- When you specify the verb, we recommend that you use one of the predefined verb names provided by Windows PowerShell (aliases for these predefined verbs are included in the following tables). When you use a predefined verb, you ensure consistency between the cmdlets that you create, the cmdlets that are provided by Windows PowerShell, and the cmdlets that are designed by others.

- Use the predefined verbs to describe the general scope of the action, and use parameters to further refine the action of the cmdlet.

- To enforce consistency across cmdlets, do not use a synonym of an approved verb.

- Use only the form of each verb that is listed in this topic. For example, use "Get", but do not use "Getting" or "Gets".

- Use Pascal casing for verbs. In Pascal casing the initial letter of each word is capitalized, such as "ForEach".

- Do not use the following reserved verbs or aliases. These verbs are used by the Windows PowerShell language, or by special case cmdlets provided by Windows PowerShell.

- ForEach (foreach)

- Format (f)

- Group (gp)

- Sort (sr)

- Tee (te)

- Where (wh)

## Similar Verbs for Different Actions

The following similar verbs represent different actions.

`New` vs. `Set`
The `New` verb is used to create a new resource. The `Set` verb is used to modify an existing resource, optionally creating the resource if it does not exist, such as the `Set-Variable` cmdlet.

`Find` vs. `Search`
The `Find` verb is used to look for an object. The `Search` verb is used to create a reference to a resource in a container.

`Get` vs. `Read`
The `Get` verb is used to retrieve a resource, such as a file. The `Read` verb is used to get information from a source, such as a file.

`Invoke` vs. `Start`
The `Invoke` verb is used to perform an operation that is generally a synchronous operation, such as running a command. The `Start` verb is used to begin an operation that is generally an asynchronous operation, such as starting a process.

`Ping` vs. `Test`
Use the `Test` verb.

## Common Verbs
