# Writing a Windows PowerShell Workflow

You can create a XAML workflow by adding activities exposed by Windows PowerShell assemblies to the Workflow designer in Visual Studio. The following Windows PowerShell assemblies expose workflow-enabled activities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A XAML workflow must be packaged as a module if you want to provide help for the workflow. For information about modules, see [Writing a Windows PowerShell Module](../module/writing-a-windows-powershell-module.md).
